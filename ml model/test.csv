0,"After 8 years playing it, I didn't improve my skills in-game.

However, I learned new language skills: now I can curse in Russian and Brazilian Portuguese.

Also, my tolerance level to guttural screams and loud sounds was increased.

Now I can bear the crying of my children for longer and I can make them feel better by singing sweet traditional songs from other cultures, such as Очи чёрные (Dark Eyes) or Garota de Ipanema (The Girl from Ipanema).

In conclusion, Counter Strike transformed me into a better father and a better person, in addition to making me more patient, tolerant to hateful people and more trained in languages and cultures.

36,"No wonder CS is 20+ years old. This game is so addictive. I was never really into gaming but this game changed my opinion. This is one of the most accurate FPS games ever made with 128 tick servers. This game requires passion, dedication, hardwork, skill & a lot of practice because every pixel counts when you trigger you gun. Rumours say CS:GO is going to shift on Source 2 Engine within 2 weeks, really excited for it. 

When you will play on low tier like Silver & Gold Nova you may lose many games because of your teammates. They may do basic mistakes like Run & Gun, Team Flash etc. But never rage on them. Always remember we used to do the same basic mistakes when we were beginners. I know this game involves lot of emotion but keep your calm & make sure to teach the beginners. Our community is already toxic, lets not make it more.

70,"I was very young when I first got to know Counter-Strike back in  the early days of Counter-Strike 1.5.
It was in an Internet-Café during Holidays where I even got to play the game for the first time. 

Some years later some friends from the area were playing CS 1.6 and thats where I joined the Steam and Counterstrike-Community on January 8th, 2006. 

We formed a team, trained about two years and climbed up the ladder of our local CS-League here in Switzerland.
However, due to insufficient capacity (private life)  of some members and a lack of Morale we split up.

I've seen Counter-Strike in all of its states from 1.5 on, 1.6, Condition Zero, Source, I even had my hands on the old mod called ""CS Promod"" where people tried to get the gameplay from 1.6 with the graphics of Source. Which was something I really liked.

After a long break I decided to reroll in CS:GO and check out how the game had evolved. It took a while but the more I played and did matchmakings (good mm's ^^) the more I wanted to set foot in E-Sports again. 

CS:GO is the perfect balance between the gameplay of 1.6 and the graphics of source (while its not source, definitely and luckily not.), to most efficient CS players ive talked to graphics dont matter and it explains why many Pro's do play with low resolutions and stuff like that because it reminds them of the good ol' days (from what i've read).

Though it still has its harsh and sometimes frustrating learning-curve, it is worth the effort because if you truly stick to it and learn about it each time you play and try to learn from your mistakes the better you get. 

Since all those years i've tried out almost all other game titles in the FPS genre, nothing could ever stand up against the simplicity and competitiveness of Counter-Strike for me. 

If you're looking for a great team-experience (which you first need to create or join) in where every man counts, every round counts and has a big community involved with tournaments and stuff, this game is for you.

However if you're looking for a realistic shooter that compares guns 1:1 like in real life, with bulletdrop and things like that, this game is definitely not for you.

I hope my shared thoughts on the game where helpful and gave you a bit of insight whether you want to join our community. 

Best Regards

72,"The competitive Counter-Strike scene is at its peak. There’s more talent than ever in pro CS, which means that in order to pick the best players in the world you need clear, specific criteria. To make this ranking, a player must have competed in a number of top tier events—no player can be awarded top ten status for simply being incredible online. Almost by default, that means the player will be on a top team as well, which is the case for everyone on this list.

81,"I probably won't have a popular opinion here but it is how I feel none the less.

I played CS a lot when it was first released as a mod for Half-life. I put hundreds of hours into both pub matches and matches with my friends in private servers. I stopped playing it at about the time that it was about to make the move to a retail product 

Counter-strike as a franchise is something of a time capsule. It is a example of a late 90's shooter frozen in time that never really changes and that is probably what makes it both novel for the average gamer and important for the competitive scene that has formed around it (and taken control of it in a lot of ways).

Because a e-sports style competitive scene has formed around Counter-strike, it puts Valve in a difficult position because they can't really change anything without facing harsh resistance from the veteran players. Even minor visual changes are met with extreme criticism because they may upset the carefully cultivated meta.

It was not always like this. When I was playing, the idea of e-sports level competitive play was only just starting to manifest and thus it was more rare to find the ultra-competitive players who get wrapped up in memorizing spread patterns, researching dominant strategies and reading up on the established meta. A lot of players back then were just there because it was fun to play and had a huge playerbase (thus meaning that servers were always reasonably available).

Playing Counter-strike back then was not the commitment that it can be now. The overall behavior of the playerbase was different. You may have gotten the usual smack talk during a match but you did not have people telling you to do things exactly this certain way in order for the whole thing to play out like a E-sports match either (at least not in any great number).

Playing Counter-strike now is essentially a test to see how much you like getting pub-stomped by uber-experienced and ultra-competitive players. It is not a overly welcoming place for new players (though not everyone is negative to new players and some will help you out) and has a culture all of it's own. This culture will either be really cool to you or annoying as hell, there is not much room for anything in between.

If you want a competitive gaming experience that is largely shaped by the most competitive (and vocal) players. Counter-strike is for you. If you want something more like a typical modern shooter or something that is more casual, It's not the best place to start.

In the end, this is just a opinion, I understand that Counter-strike is going to be a different experience for different people. I know that I am probably a bit old and thus missed the competitive level gaming boat by a few years but that does not change the fact that I have played (and own) Counter-strike: Global offensive and the culture that has formed around that game is not something I can really get into.

Been playing Counter-Strike since 1.5 that came out in 2002. For some of us it has a lot of memories and childhood nostalgia. To keep it short yes, I would recommend to see what all the fuss is about if you haven't already.

To try and write something useful here is my advice to you, new player, if you want to improve:

* It's alright you suck, CS:GO is a highly highly skill based game, don't sweat it. If you're not having fun sucking, though, you should probably quit. There will be a lot of sucking and it's OK to rage sometimes, but if it's constant no fun just move on

* Get a good mouse specifically for first-person shooters. No, that Razer Naga you play World of Warcraft with won't do. Google 'Rocket Jump Ninja mice' for good recommendations from a 19+ years Quake player

* Alongside the mouse, REALLY I mean REALLY spend the time to find your mouse sensitivity. It is worth it. There are plenty of guides to google

* have a MINIMUM of 60 FPS, otherwise you're really gimping yourself. Personally I wouldn't play without at least a steady 100

* No, you don't need a 144Hz monitor, I reached Global (highest official rank) perfectly fine without it. It is nice though if you can afford it

* As with anything, consistency and practice is key. The other rarely mentioned but just as important thing, though, is TAKE BREAKS. If you feel burnt out just play something else. It's fine. You will come back fresh and ready to improve

* If you won, but didn't improve - you lost. If you lost, but you improved - you won. Have this mindset and your results will take care of themselves

* SoloQ is really as any other game, if you have a hard time handling negativity this also might not be for you. I personally just mute any sort of toxicity and that works for me

* Get a PRIME account (reach lvl 21) ASAP and only play with it enabled when possible. The increase in game quality is noticable

Good luck!

Fast forward just about one year and my friend recommended I try it again. Well, i've got to say that the game has come a long way and has vastly improved from it's release version.

The game is basically 1.6 with improved graphics and mechanics. While it still needs work in many areas, the current state of the game is highly enjoyable and worth the mediocre price of $14.99.

If you're a long time CS player like me (Beta 1) and don't have this game yet, add me to your friends list and we'll reminisce about the old days and maybe i'll throw a copy your way.

119,"I've been playing Counter-Strike since around 2000 when it was 1.6 beta.  It was a natural progression for me from HL Deathmatch which was a ton of fun back in the day also.  I've been loyal to this game for almost 20 years and have racked up hours I wouldn't even want to know playing it, but i've had a ton of fun with it too!! 

It's funny to watch and participate in something as it evolves and grows, especially to something that has become so popular on a global scale and not only that, without CS I question if there would even be a Steam service.  It's funny how things happen!!  

Nobody will ever read this so i have no idea why i'm spending the time writing a review of this type, especially when i started out just to gain a credit for more XP, funny :)  

CS and the community have got me through a few difficult times in my life and i'm forever grateful for that, but I have to say that the current state of affairs with the game, steam and Valve are a little sad.  There's no interraction with the fanbase of the game that made Valve and Steam what it is today, and that's very disappointing for me.  Valve own such a fantastic product but appear to have lost sight of their roots and where all their success came from.  The development of the game has lagged behind and if not careful will quickly become the way of the Blackberry (I was going to say DoDo but thought BBerry was just the same and applicable!).  Why has there not been greater advancement of the Source platform to take better advantage of today's gaming PC horsepower and reinvigourate a community that's becoming quickly displeased with the lack of communication as to the games direction, as well as current play-ability, variety and lack of transparancy?  If Valve have no intentions of investing the required resources and money into developing this sleeping giant of games into something that will see an explosion of interest, praise and thanks from the gaming community as a whole then...why not sell it to someone who will take it forward with purpose fans like me are crying out for???  Think about it and get back to me why don't you (and i'll be offered a job by valve to lead the team forward into delivering a product the community really wants - sarcasm).

My review won't be complete without touching on the current Steam vs Opskins, and the whole trading saga in general. Why won't Valve introduce an age bracket market for trading etc. that requires Government official Photo ID Age verification that removes certain restrictions like trading for and returning real money etc.?  There's so much potential there, the market history proves that, so why not consider offering more than one type of service?  It's a little shortsighted from ValSteam to not consider their market demographics are as varied as the number of games on sale in their store and have never really persued any course of action to capitalize on those different market segments, or maybe you are, or, maybe you're just dealing with so much legal backlog from the ""loot box"" gambling situation?!?!?!  Who know's?  Certainly nobody in the community, why?  No communication.  Is it because you don't think you're client base are capable of comprehending the current situation or is it because the majority of your client base are 15 and under and you don't consider that a worthwhile demographic to answer to?  A closing comment on this particular aspect of the review...Valve/Steam...please remember that every year that client base grows, so does the diversity of age and the growing expectations from a community you yourselves helped build, so be prepared and be willing to change or you too, will go the same way as the Blackberry DoDo. 

Anyway, CS is a great game and I'll always play it and just like every place in this world, both real and virtual, you will find the majority of people are good and don't cheat, but you also get the least desireable of people you find everywhere too and thankfully, like everywhere else, they're the minority.

165,"Counter Strike: Global Offensive

[b]Counterstrike is a game that slowly ravages and pulverizes your soul each and every time you play it.[/b] 

Everyone starts with the same thoughts when they play CS:GO: 

1) 'Pfft. I'm never going to spend money in game buying skins and keys, that's stupid'
2) I'm never going to get that angry, it's only a game. 
3) 'Meh, doesn't look that hard'

[strike]Within a month -[/strike]
Within a week - 

1) You’ve already have bought a P90 module skin because ""Oh, It's only 30p"" and you begin your slow downward spiral into the CS:GO marketplace, saving up for a knife and opening crates, in hopes of getting a knife which (deep on the inside, deep deep down) you know you're never going to get, and end up spending £10 opening crates, and getting back 50p worth of skins back. 
 2) You’ve probably already threatened a handful of people with their lives; it’s a game that can turn any lovely human being into a [b]soul eating behemoth[/b] within minutes of a match starting.  Get used to wanting to assassinate everyone in your near vicinity. 
3) You'll already gave uninstalled the game at [u]least[/u] twice, in utter exasperation and in utter hope of cleansing your life from this game. [u]But you can't,[/u] you'll always go back.

The community is [b]utterly merciless and beastly,[/b] with over half the people being angry 12 year old Russians. The betting will completely waste you and rip you of all of your favourite 50p worth of skins. And the trading is completely unreliable, leaving you to deal with steam support, which is 10x more brutal than the game itself. 

But of course you’ll go back, it’s CS:GO, it’s a drug. A soul destroying, mind numbing, murder spree inducing drug.

178,Playing Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is like masturbating. Feels good doing it but later you regret it. And then you keep on doing it.,True
179,"You want buy this game ? 
I'm gonna show you somes tips for playing :
- Before the match starts, don't press accept. It's a test. 
- The P in P90 stands for Pro. Like you. 
- When told to pick up the AWP, stare at it and go AFK. 
- Don't buy kits, this is actually team death match, the bomb wont ever get planted. 
- You are amazing with the desert eagle, don't let anyone ever tell you different, not even the scoreboard. 
- Very important: That thing attached to some guns is called a silencer, and you have to take it off because it reduces damage a lot and will get you more kills. 
- VAC is a good anti cheat. 
- Skins make you better at the game. 
- When a teammate asks for a drop, drop them your handgun. 
- Never adapt to the game. Don't betray yourself like that. Just do the same thing over and over again and wait until it works. 
- Dust 2 is the only map in the game. There aren't any others. Don't argue. 
- If you lose the first round. You MUST ALWAYS Eco/Save. Which means buy armour and an -SMG/Shotgun of your choosing. 
- When going through doors, always make sure that you block the doors so no one can pass. - -- Ignore the hate of your teammates, you're pro and you're gonna get mad kills. You're also shielding them from bullets. How nice of you! 
- Crouching doesn't improve accuracy, but do you know what does? Jumping! Be a ♥♥♥♥ing kangaroo and watch the mad kills pour in. ♥♥♥♥ EVERYONE LOVES KANGAROOS. 
50 points to Gryffindor every time you change weapons. 
- State that all SMG's take skill to use from no less than 4 inches away. Your gun is cheaper so it is worse. Rub it in with a teabag afterwards. Especially if you have a P90. 
- Always tell the opposing team to good luck and have fun when warm-up ends. At half time, treat them like they murdered your family. (Be sure to take note of their nationality!) 
- If you see a chicken in your gameplay, you absolutely must under any circumstance, kill that damn chicken. It must die. THIS IS NON NEGOTIABLE. 
- Recoil control is a myth. Like Bigfoot.
- If you need to get around the map in a hurry, get out your Negev. 
- The PP-Bizon is the discount Negev. 
- Don't waste money on a helmet. $350 is too expensive. You wont die. Ever. 
- You need to Look at the ground where you are going make sure you don't trip!

187,"**UPDATED REVIEW (05/05/2018) LOOK BELOW **

Ok, I think is time for me to write a honest review for this game

Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is one of the most broken and unfair games I've ever played...
but I still love it

Why? well let me tell ya

I've had some many feelings while playing this game that I've never had before like desperation with anger, rage,  happiness, sadness, adrenaline, etc.

This game became a part of my life, I've met most of my best friends in this game, one of the most important relationships I had was built in this game. I've met every kind of person, the one that rages every second, the leader bottom frag, the Canadian, the Mexican, the Australian, the adult with kids, the kid, the furry, very nice people, the most annoying people I've ever met in my whole life, the smurf, the carry, the bad team, the great team, the ''grill'' and the list goes on.

Valve makes changes without any previous advice to the players, and they make changes to the very keys of the game, like the rank system, a whole map, the gun recoil, the sounds of every gun, the whole sound system of the game, prices of some in-game items, and the community usually gets mad at it at first, but we get used to it anyways.

What do I mean with ''unfair'' and ''broken''?
Well, in matchmaking (prime or non-prime) you're gonna find a smurf, a hacker, a whole queue of griefers, derankers etc,
Valve tries to stop this, but I personally feel they're giving up which is really annoying.

Another example for broken will be the rank system, is so weird and unfair for some players, when you're Nova II sometimes the other team could be Nova master or Silver elite, or a weird mix of those ranks, it took me around 160Hrs to get out of Silver after the rank system update, even if I had good perfomance, no rank up for a loooong time

If you're thinking about buying this game, you should totally start with a friend, is more fun in general, but if you're a very first time player joining a competitive game, I can't promise that your team is gonna be the most patient in that game, usually some players demand people that already know all the tactics and recoils, without knowing that you gotta start somewhere, but if you find a group of people that is patient and most important of all if they help you to improve your game, you should stick with them and play together more often. But don't think you'll always play with them, trust what I'm telling you, most of these people meet others and move on, but if you have a long term friendship with someone like that, you're incredebly lucky. 

now Datsuke, all those things doesn't sound very appealing

Well, maybe in paper they don't, but after experiencing a good game, after experiencing clean headshots, long range noscopes, carrying a team, a grenade kill, seeing a hacker getting VAC banned mid-game, clutching the round, getting a kill through the smoke, being called a ''hacker'' for your skill, laughing with your teammates is the most satisfying things ever, winning a close competitive game knowing that you perfom well gives you a huge feeling of success making you play more and more. Besides, you meet very different people, you listen a new accent every day, you learn a new word or a internet term every day, you learn something new in general. Other thing I love about this game is that, learning, there's always something new to learn in every map, every gun, a new position, a new boost spot, a new flash, a new smoke, a new prefire spot. I have 1,400Hrs right now of play time, and I think I don't even know the half of the smokes in Mirage. 

So yea, this game is really good, most of the time, you're gonna see yourself ragging every now and then, but personally I think is worth it

**UPDATE**

Okay, it's been more than a year from my original review,
Have I changed my thoughts?.. Sort of.

The game haven't recieved much love from Valve, and Prime matchmaking is still in beta,
about Prime matchmaking, for some reason the lobbies always default to trust factor which is horrible, and to my knowledge you cannot make it Prime as default (correct me if I'm wrong).

The community is pretty much the same, nothing has changed on that note.

Now, I have more complains on matchmaking:
I used to think that the game itself is broken, I really did, I thought that the hitboxes were messed up (which I have a video example of that, that I recorded myself here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0jIfWjd2BE watch it if you wish) but really what is really broken are the matchmaking servers, how do I know this? Well, I been wanting to take the game a little more serious, so I signed up for ESEA which is a paid suscription to other servers that are basically competitive games, the difference here is that the matchmaking servers are 64 tick and the ESEA servers are 128 tick, which is a world of a difference, everything is more accurate when is about headshots and all of that good stuff, and I believe ESEA has more servers so my ping on matchmaking is usually 60-80ms on ESEA servers is around 20-35ms. On ESEA the ranking isn't **AS** broken as matchmaking and the community on ESEA takes the game pretty seriously and don't mess around, which I really like that, however the problem is that it is a paid suscription which not everyone is willing to pay, so there's also FACEIT which provides the same service as ESEA but for free, however Faceit has premium features but payment is not obligated to play.

So, the game is pretty much the same, not many fixes or changes going on, but I wanted to update this review since these third-party services change the game experience dramatically and make the game generally more enjoyable, so give those a try and they make help you like the game a little more, at least it worked for me.

188,"I slowly look at the luminescent green dial of my wristwatch, which tells me it is 5:46, am. Damn.
Another night of Insomnia.  

I sit up in my bed, and listen to the soft hum of my Radeon™ HD 7870 GHz Edition, as her fans slowly cool the surface of her brilliant silicon plates. The only light in this room comes from the electric blue glow of my keyboard, and the azure LEDs in my Razer Abyssus.

I press a button, and the display of a 23 inch, 1080p IPS monitor lights up, colors shifting and changing in psychedelic pattens, chromatic waves of light bluring and stabilizing to send an image within my mind. 

My desktop stares back at me; the only icon the Recycle bin. I move my eyes to the Taskbar, where the icons for Windows Explorer, Star Citizen, Mozilla Firefox, and lastly Steam return my gaze.

I click on Steam, and watch as a loading bar appears. The light from the moniter shines brilliantly on my face, and if I look closely into it, I can see myself reflected in the crystal surface, eyes staring deep into a mad realm of pixels and insomnia.

Steam finally loads. Oh, what's this? There's a sale on? Ah, too bad; I only have one cent in my wallet. I click the library tab in a futile attempt to find meaning.

My list of games appears, showing me hints of open doors into new worlds, strange and wonderful. What path sould I choose? Should I join battle with Dragons, in the strage land of the Nords? Or, perhaps, I should launch the StarCitizen hangar module, and lust after a dream of flight, a game not yet finished.

Ah, but here it is; Counter-Strike: Global Offensive. How many hours have I thus spent within you, oh CS:GO? You have been the reason for many nights without sleep, many days of ragequits, many days of fun and sadness. I pull out a calculator from somewhere on my desk: dividing one thousand, eight hundred and eighty-five hours by twenty-four tells me that I've been within this game for seventy-eight point five days so far. Damn.

The game begins loading, and I hear the soft hum of GPU fans, and the silent sound of the sunrise, far beyond the single window of my room.

_


Ah, where was I? I guess I feel alseep for a second there. Skip the intros, enter main menu, searc- Wait, what? 20 friends online? But, it's like 6 am... Oh, right, timezones. Eh, I might as well invite all these people.

Well, I guess I didn't want to play with them anyway. Green light fills my room, I press accept, and wait for the ninth player. Who, it seems, never can figure out what the big glowing green button actually means. Oh well, it just found another match anyway.

Well, third time's the chram, right? I guess not. Fourth time does it, and we're away. Cue loading screen, begin meaningless text I've seen only a few thousand times before.

I get up, walk towards the kitchen, and only trip twice on miscellaneous paraphernalia in the dark hallways. The bleak windows of the room greet me: pale dawn, gray clouds and black trees visible through their panes. The neon numerals of the microwave tell the time as 6:07. I search the pantry and refr!gerator, but find nothing of value.

I lower my standards and try again, this time coming up with a few tastless cookies of some kind. I begin a pilgrimage to whence I came.

The last stars of night grow cold and die; as color once again spreads over the sky. Monitor glow, winter snow, cybernetic flow.

My quest now complete, with prize in hand, I return to my chair. 0's and 1's stream across a fiberoptic gulf of space, connecting people hundreds of miles apart in a beautiful lattice of data, all for my enjoyment. I begin the first round, and purchase a FN Five-Seven and a Flashbang grenade.

I move over to long A, and hold my sights on the old wooden doors. An insurgent sprints through the open door, firing his Glock-18 as fast as he can, his bullets hitting the wal beside my head.

I pull the trigger, a volcanic plume of hot gas propelling a one gram lead alloy projectile at twice the speed of sound into the side of his head; The FN 5.7×28mm armor piercing round delivering a fatal 540 Joules of energy. The neon Stattrak™ display mounted on the left side of my Case Hardened Five-Seven increases by one, and a bright flare from the muzzle reflects its light in the cold metal of a name tag, the words ""NOT ON MY WATCH"" silently mocking those fools who fall by my pistol, in an absurd pun about clocks.

Another Terrorist moves into view, I fire three supersonic rounds into his chest, and one in his skull. Again the neon numbers shift and rearrange in a mad dance, as bullets enter my manly chest hair and are absorbed.

A third Terrorist fires, and I die in the gameworld, madly shooting as my bullets hit empty space. Pixels shift and change in an algorithmic song, and my teammates finish what I began, with the severing of a red wire a small number one is added in blue to the top of my screen.

Second round, man. Time to roll. I got long-  wait, why are two of you going there? Nevermind, I'll hold Catwalk.

_


Turns out they decided to rush Mid with pistols. Poor choice.  I leap out of catwalk into mid as they rush the doors, electric blue pathways of fire traversing the void between my tazer and and the insurgent's back. He screams in death as I drop the now-useless tazer and unholster a Bizon SMG;  9mm rounds begining to sputter at 320 meters per second into the backs of my foes as a Terrorist pulls a 180 and flicks a round into my skull with his CZ-75 Automatic, punching through my helmet into the flesh beneath. I mutter to myself ""I fucking hate that gun"" while typing out ""#TAZED BITCH"" in all chat.

Childish insults fly like eagles, soaring over skies of wire and valleys of silicon to majestically land in the lower right of my vision, proclaiming their wondrous messages for all to see. ""get rekt"" ""u suck"" ""TIME to die, amirite""

Using the mighty power of a pistol save round, the enemy gains a round.

From far beyond my drywall cube, a sun the color of a Helium discharge tube bleeds the first light of Autumn into a sky the color of Krypton: but here I am safe from its incandescent fingers, here, the persistance of color exists in the 60hz of my monitor. Perhaps tomorrow will be different? Oh, but I don't think it will.

The scoreboard moves with its own hateful volition, seemingly granting rounds with a heart of cinder and magma. Chaos lies within its eyes.

Final round of the first half begins and I press f1 to auto buy, supplanting my XM1014 from the previous round with an M4A4 Bullet Rain, tastefully decorated with a ""REKT"" holographic sticker and renamed ""Clockwork Assfucking"". I once again reflect on what a stupid name that is, and regret selling my Desert Eagle Blaze to buy it.

Surprisingly, my team manages to hold a push at long. In the simultaneous push to cat a rain of lead from a thundering sky finds my face with magnetic precision, and in the downtime I skim through my Ebook library on my phone. I've been considering writing something in the style of Neuromancer or Ready Player One for awhile now, perhaps if I can find the right subject... Oh well, that's a project for another day. Translation: never.

Halftime, and the tally stands at ten for them and five for us. I've seen worse. I've seen better too, but what the hell, this isn't hopeless yet.

Pistol round begins and I buy Dualies, partly just to fuck with people and partly because for reasons that I can neither explain nor defend I'm ridiculously good with them. Don't dis my Dualie skills, man. Just accept it. Like a wizard and his wand: you do not choose the Dualies, the Dualies choose you.

I pop smoke Mid and rush Catwalk, suddenly realizing I hit the character limit while subsequently breaking the 4th wall.

I slowly look at the luminescent green dial of my wristwatch, which tells me it is 6:34, am. Damn.
Another night of Insomnia.",True
189,"Great game, ruined by cheaters.",True
190,"In this game you are a Terrorist or elite Counter-Terrorist who has never fired a gun in their life before a round starts. You must help your character learn how to control their guns while killing enemies. Strangely, each character has the mysterious power to fire one or two shots without ridiculous recoil by very briefly jerking in the opposite direction they are moving in. 

When your character wears a Kevlar vest, every part of your character, except the head, are made out of steel. Therefore, the only way to quickly kill people is to shoot them in the head. This can be annoying at first, but you will soon get used to shooting a small smudge of pixels on top of a character's body. 

The Goddess of Guns can materialize guns in your character's hands a few seconds before a round starts. However, your character must pay for the guns, which have vastly overinflated prices. When you have the right amount of money, the Goddess will flash a menu in your character's eyes, allowing them to select the guns they want. More advanced users can make guns materialize out of thin air with their mind as long as they have the right amount of money.

Maps are often about evil terrorists trying to bomb deserted places. Vandalism is a very serious crime in the Counter-Strike series, so elite Counter-Terrorists are deployed to stop them. Unfortunately for the Terrorists, they are dumb and only packed one bomb. However, the Counter-Terrorists do not know how to pick up a dropped bomb, so the Terrorists can still pick it up after it is dropped by a fallen friend.

In some maps, the terrorists have kidnapped a janitor and low-level desk jockey in a building. The Counter-Terrorists have been deployed to save one, not both, of the hostages. In reality, this is just a thinly-veiled excuse for the CTs to murder the Terrorists while pumping rounds into the invincible hostages. One weird thing about hostage maps is that you can purchase a ""Hostage Rescue Kit"", which somehow makes gives you the ability to put a grown man on your shoulders in a second. Perhaps it is a spell scroll that allows hostages to hover to your character's shoulders. 

Overall, Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is a surprisingly solid game about people with the worst gun handling abilities ever seen on Earth. Even though your characters have the aiming abilities of someone with Parkinsons Disease, you have many tactical options that make the game very fun and dynamic. It's worth picking up.",True

253,"You want to buy this game ? 
I'm gonna show you somes tips for playing:
- Before the match starts, don't press accept. It's a test. 
- The P in P90 stands for Pro. Like you. 
- When told to pick up the AWP, stare at it and go AFK. 
- Don't buy kits, this is actually team death match, the bomb wont ever get planted. 
- You are amazing with the desert eagle, don't let anyone ever tell you different, not even the scoreboard. 
- Very important: That thing attached to some guns is called a silencer, and you have to take it off because it reduces damage a lot and will get you more kills. 
- VAC is a good anti cheat. 
- Skins make you better at the game. 
- When a teammate asks for a drop, drop them your handgun. 
- Never adapt to the game. Don't betray yourself like that. Just do the same thing over and over again and wait until it works. 
- Dust 2 is the only map in the game. There aren't any others. Don't argue. 
- If you lose the first round. You MUST ALWAYS Eco/Save. Which means buy armour and an -SMG/Shotgun of your choosing. 
- When going through doors, always make sure that you block the doors so no one can pass. - -- Ignore the hate of your teammates, you're pro and you're gonna get mad kills. You're also shielding them from bullets. How nice of you! 
- Crouching doesn't improve accuracy, but do you know what does? Jumping! Be a ♥♥♥♥ing kangaroo and watch the mad kills pour in. ♥♥♥♥ EVERYONE LOVES KANGAROOS. 
50 points to Gryffindor every time you change weapons. 
- State that all SMG's take skill to use from no less than 4 inches away. Your gun is cheaper so it is worse. Rub it in with a teabag afterwards. Especially if you have a P90. 
- Always tell the opposing team to good luck and have fun when warm-up ends. At half time, treat them like they murdered your family. (Be sure to take note of their nationality!) 
- If you see a chicken in your gameplay, you absolutely must under any circumstance, kill that damn chicken. It must die. THIS IS NON NEGOTIABLE. 
- Recoil control is a myth. Like Bigfoot.
- If you need to get around the map in a hurry, get out your Negev. 
- The PP-Bizon is the discount Negev. 
- Don't waste money on a helmet. $350 is too expensive. You wont die. Ever. 
- You need to Look at the ground where you are going make sure you don't trip!

256,"I bought this game for the chickens, and was not disappointed. After exploring the countless lands the chickens have traveled far and wide, I realized their population was growing too large. The chickens had started to inhabit such horrid locations across the world, such as nuclear plants, and offices without cafeterias. I knew what had to be done. I bought a flip knife off of the steam market, and called PETA. I listened to In the Arms of an Angel in my Microsoft Professional Deluxe Gaming Chair 360 for about twelve hours with no response, so, I decided to take matters into my own hands. I loaded up de_nuke and started to put the chickens out of their misery. I cried harder that night than I have ever before. 

The next morning, with tears in my eyes, I loaded up Counter-Strike: Global Chicken, and I saw a new item waiting in my inventory. My Flip Knife had turned into a Flip Knife Slaughter. At that moment, I realized what a horrible thing I had done. 
With my hand shaking, I navigated my mouse, and uninstalled Counter-Strike: Global Chicken. 

I regret everything I have done. I am writing this review to warn you about the chickens, and to let you know I have made a full recovery, and that I have started my new journey in Goat Simulator. Thank you, and farewell.",True

Don't Spam Report (Or report at all even if they are cheating, because a lot of them won't get banned and it'll flag you as a false reporter), Don't Be Toxic, Don't Get Kicked Or Leave Games.

DO NOT HAVE A BRAND NEW STEAM ACCOUNT

DON'T PLAY MIRAGE OR OVERPASS (Stick to the less played maps like Nuke.) These maps are cheater heaven. (or hell)

272,"CSGO is a near-perfect multiplayer shooter. Unlike the previous versions, which were often difficult to get in to, this one offers a variety of modes that will appeal to all skill levels. It has a large community and a well supported workshop, ensuring that this discount-priced game will be around for years to come.

In short, you either play as the good or bad guys and must either kill the other team or complete objectives to win the round, which will earn you more money to do the same thing again but faster. It's been around for years and has spawned many imitators.

The game isn't much of a looker as it is based on the same engine as the original Half Life 2 was. However, Valve have polished it as much as they can and the community consists of lots of awesome mappers who have been churning out brilliantly imaginative and beautiful maps almost on a daily basis.

Is it worth getting if you already own Counter Strike: Source? Yes. CSS was always Counter Strike shoe-horned into the Source engine. CSGO feels far more like a standalone game. Valve have very carefully listened to what people have wanted and have made a very appealing game. The best feature must be the competitive play. You cannot leave these matches or you'll suffer a temporary ban from the feature. After 10 wins in this mode you'll be ranked and will be paired up with people of the same skill, meaning that the game is challenging but fair regardless of your skill level. These matches are exciting, occasionally scary or frustrating, but are the most rewarding part of the game and improving your rank is one of the most satisfying experiences in any video game, ever.

There are all kinds of teams and communities that you can join. Really, if I was stuck on a desert island with one game this would most likely be my top choice. It's bigger than you can hope to conquer and has a huge community around it which will likely be around for years to come, something that can't be said for the Call of Duty franchise which is probably its closest rival. Remember that those games are full price and have another one churned out each year, fragmenting the community. Plus you can customise your weapon skins in CSGO.

276,"WARNING, this game will take your soul and your fist born once you start it.

Positiv things to say about CSGO:
- meet people from all around  t̶h̶e̶ ̶w̶o̶r̶l̶d̶  Russia
- learn abusive words in all languages
- fun for the whole family, meet all ages between 50 and 10
- opening a case for 2.19€ and get a 0.03€ skin is very fun
- 64-tick servers are fun for everybody

Negativ things one should mention:
- toxic people everywhere
- skins lead to empty bankaccount
- some are using toasters as their microphone
- still too many russians which abuse you for not speaking russian
- playing in gold elo is harder than playing mg elo 
- after 500 hours in CS you have to invest in a string just to be prepared for emergencies

View of playing CS as a girl:
- always fun M8s are abusive kids or kids trying to flirt with you
- comments like ""girls shouldn´t play this"", ""women have no rights"" or ""go in the kitchen"" ... and YES their mommy are be very proud of their remark
- best comment until now : 10y/o russian kid ""go play cooking simulator"" as well as some N-bombs through the Game 
- and NO most aren´t friendly because of you being a girl
- the bright spot: some M8s being very friendly and are sorry for the other guy flaming you ... thanks to all of them they make MM bearable :) <3

If u are new like me u will be trolled, kicked out, hated (because of being noob) from matchmaking servers. People will fire you u heavenly words(slangs) when u miss to kill. But as I said many are not like that. Best way is to mute those godly creatures and play and improve .

282,"CS:GO is a highly competitive skill-based game. This is what makes it so great, learning the maps, all of the different tactics, improving your aim and managing the economy. This however, can be a long grind. Every map has its own calls, grenade spots to learn and positions to play.

CS:GO runs great(although every updates costs FPS), has some good sound design, and decent graphics for an older game. Updates come regularly to add stuff and valve keeps improving the game. A big downside of CS:GO however is the big amount of cheaters. If you don't link your phone number to the game and play in ""prime-matchmaking"" the game can be literally unplayable. This can be very frustrating, especially when you're doing your best to rank up and improve. 

Aim and sound play an important role in CS:GO, More than in most other shooters. every gun has it's own recoil pattern to learn and it's own unique playstyle. Since CS:GO requires alot more tactics than most other shooters, aim is more important aswell. Having your crosshair at the right position means you can take your opponent down alot faster. Alot of practice, and playing aim maps helps and using your sound to locate your enemy's footsteps gives you a big advantage. The CS:GO Esports scene is also massive, milions of people follow it and it's a great place to learn. Use this to your advantage. Wanna know those new tactics, boosts and smoke/flashes? Watch some games! You can honestly learn alot from watching the pro's play. 

Now ofcourse, you saw this one coming, the community can be really... annoying. Especially at lower ranks the community is full of toxic kids, people who have no idea what they are doing and teammates who refuse to work together. This can be harsh, especially because CS:GO heavily relies on teamwork. Thats why i recommend playing this game with friends, and practicing alot. The faster you're out of those low ranks the better! Once you get a bit higher you'll see the community gets better and better(with the occasional toxic/clueless player ofcourse). People work together, people give usefull information and are just a bit more nice in general.

Next to competitive, CS:GO also has some game-modes for people who just want to have some fun and don't care about ranks or tactics. Gamemmodes like: Gun-Game, Team Deathmatch and Casual are great for this and the thousands of community servers offer cool things like: Surfing, Aim training, roleplay, minigames and more!

Now would i recommend CS:GO? Yea ofcourse! Especially for the small amount of money it costs. Just dont expect this to be another casual shooter. It's a highly skilled game and requires you to put in alot of time to improve. Pick this up with a couple of friends so there is less chance to be matched with annoying teammates.",True

Each weapon has different recoil pattern, RoF and has ways to handle them that you'll need to learn in order to get better.

294,"So I have played this game for a couple years now with a break of 8 months between it because of some updates who got me from MGE back to the silvers..

So now I am back at it again and I am kinda in love again. Yes I also think they should change the VAC and Cooldown system, because it is pretty shit atm. But if you just play the game like you should play it, it is a pretty good game.

Before my pause I spend a shit load of money on skins, i had a shit load, I sold them all and at this point I only use the skins I get dropt in game or didnt sold. 

So the latest update ( adding wingman and scoutgame) I think thats pretty good. Only thing is they should change the wingman stuff. Because I played a couple times against people who are Global on competive so that is nog fair yet. Also the cooldown system should be sepperate. 

but the game is good.",True
295,"CS:GO came out over 3,500 days ago, almost 10 years. Since 2014, CS:GO has never had less than 250,000 concurrent players. Many games in the last decade which are considered cornerstones of PC gaming, possibly even cornerstones of FPS games in general, never even achieved that many concurrent players at their absolute peak. In 2020, CS:GO hit its all time peak of over a million concurrent players playing all at the same time, an achievement that is likely only shared with truly Earth-shatteringly popular games like LoL and WoW. This is all to say that somehow, despite being almost a decade old, CS:GO remains one of the most popular titles on PC as a whole, beating out such rivals as Apex Legends, Valorant, Warzone, PUBG, Rainbow Six Siege, and pretty much every other FPS game you can let roll off the tongue, and likely any non-shooter title you can think of as well. I would venture to say that no game aside from Minecraft and PONG has had even remotely close to the staying power of CS:GO. 

All that said, the game blows. Modern CS:GO looks dated, sounds dated, and plays like Valve's 1998 Half-Life. Source has completely knee-capped any opportunity for growth and innovation, and with a few minor meta changes and the introduction of new gamemodes and weapons, CS:GO is the same game now that it was 3,500 days ago. Some would argue that this is a sign of perfection, of effortless staying power, but I would argue that it is a sign of a lazy cash grab. Let's be honest, in comparison to modern competitors, CS:GO's movement is incredibly clunky. You can draw a direct lineage between crouch-jumping mid-doors on Dust II to completing puzzles in Black Mesa in Half Life. CS:GO is likely the only game about using firearms that does not allow you to ADS and more or less guarantees the user that the bullets coming from their firearm will not hit what they are looking at unless they have perfect movement, aim, and spray-pattern knowledge. Very few weapons have been added in the last decade, and those that have been added are generally worse in every measurable way to those that they replace. Dust II remains the most popular map and has itself only seen a light graphical upgrade with only a small handful of map design changes. New maps are introduced, regularly complained about, and removed from the current map pool. If you are reading this in 2032, Dust II is likely still the most popular map and likely remains un-upgraded. 

Socially, the game is terrible. The vast majority of the user base is either incredibly toxic, racist, cheating, or a combination of all three. The way that matchmaking works, it is easy to come across smurf after smurf after smurf, losing game after game after game to players who's real skill is likely 10x higher than CS:GO placed them. I cannot begin to count the number of games in which I was subjected to player's profile pictures that were outright pornographic or I was called racial or homophobic slurs. ""Toxic"" does not even begin to describe how inhumane the CS:GO community can be at times. 

So thus far, I have established that CS:GO is one of the most popular games on PC that has time and time again outlasted better competitors, I have dogpiled the game for looking, sounding, and playing like a game from 1998, and I have called all of the userbase toxic cheaters. If I believe all of these things, how can I possibly recommend the game? Easy - I only play CS:GO with friends. I play for fun and to collect skins. Many an hour has been spent, three or four beers deep, just chatting and joking with friends with CS:GO on in the background. Three, four, or even five-stacking pub matches is incredible fun. Playing the game in a public lobby where you and your friends work through elaborate, practiced routines of memes and jokes with poor, unsuspecting randoms is easily one of the funniest things you can do with a microphone and PC. Stupendous fun can be had when you find a player who has a sense of humor who will joke around with you as much as you with them. Every game is a win when you play with friends - you either lose the game so that your skill rating drops and you get to pub stomp the next lobby, or you win the game and your skill rating increases so that you can get pub stomped next game, thus setting you up for your own pub stomp. This circuitous motion is what keeps the game fun and fresh, you either get dumpstered on, dumpster a team, or the CS:GO matchmaking works for once and you have to fight for your life to get that 15:15. CS:GO sucks as a game, and you will never, ever see me playing it alone. But as a medium by which you can interact with your friends, CS:GO is unbeatable. Put a 30-rack in the fridge, get some T-Bell delivered, and get four friends who cannot hit the accept button with their aim and I guarantee you will make a life-long meme between the five of you.",True

328,"This game saved my life.

I am 42.

My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and adopted our son together. They are now both 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I found myself lost and miserable. I was self destructive. I got so mad one day from everything spiraling out of my control that I punched some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion. That caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand... my working hand... my games hand.. the hand that I held and carried my children to bed with.. The hand I desperately needed to make sure I could continue to provide.

After learning of the severity of my self-inflicted damage, I was borderline suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety. I have never had fits of rage, or been one to break down and cry, but I was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side.

Having nothing better to do, I searched for a game I could play, ONE HANDED while I recovered. I somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews. I decided that it had to be worth a shot... I must admit, I didn't beat the game, or play nearly as long as some of you. In fact, I may have only played this game a day or two.. With that being said, after doing so, I had a new found joy and hope for life. I was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me. I was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness. I was able to see the fruits of my ""labor"". I relaxed for 5 :hillary: :hillary: :hillary: :hillary: :hillary: :hillary: :hillary: minutes to this music long enough to realize that I was going to be okay.
After coming to that realization, I turned the game off, and I went back to work. It hurt my hand like hell but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself, and I became the father I needed to be in that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving as.

Today, I am close friend with my kids mother. We don't fight, or argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents, and friends.

I now have 3 kids. My third child is, wait for it, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my own separation, and we just stumbled in to each others life unexpectedly. We have been in a relationship for a year now, and are very happy together.

Moral of the story, you never know what life holds in store for you, and if I would have given up when all the odds were stacked against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

I fully got into this game through the competitive esport side, watching my favourite teams and players compete is just amazing and I think this has to be the most gripping, exciting sport to watch due the the unpredictablility. 

You can't deny that Counter-Strike has the best shooter mechanics of any game out there, and the tactical side is genius. Being a skilled aimer does not get you nearly as far as being smart and knowing all of the maps better than your opponent.

It really is sad that CS:GO has made such a bad name for itself due to the gambling issues and Valve's lack of cooperation, but somehow it is still one of the most played games on the platform.

This game is all about personal progression, since it comes with a high learning curve, it's not about unlocking some stupid grip or scope for your gun. It's about you, that has to learn.

The game is updated almost once a week with new features and content, Match Making is great when you are playing with friends.

The real game for people that love to play competitively, with a team or just solo.
 
There are also casual game modes available for the people that don't like to play competitively, such as Arms Race, Deathmatch, Hostage and Defusual missions which can be played on casual style, or mostly known as public or community servers. These modes are great to learn the game, and improve your play.


[u][b]Pros.[/b][/u]
◘ Match Making.
◘ Skill levels and ranks, play against players of your own skill level.
◘ Competitive scene, with ladders and tournaments.
◘ The CS feeling, transition from older CS games to CS:GO isn't that hard.
◘ Most old maps from CS, are in the game.
◘ No perks and other unnecessary clutter.
◘ Great spectator sport, easily to understand and interesting to watch!
◘ No pay to win model, all items are purely cosmetic.


[u][b]Cons.[/b][/u]
◘ Match Making 64 tick servers stability could be improved.
◘ Game could use some optimization here and there.
◘ Cheaters now and then, but that's online gaming for you.

[b]If you are looking to improve your aim skills, try out these maps.[/b]

> You're winning 13:0, so excited, going to get a 16:0
> Enemy team wins one round. Calm down, you'll get them next time!
> Enemy team wins
> Exit CS:GO

How Casual in CS:GO works
> Everyone on team dies from the ""hacker"" AWP that keeps killing you
> Last guy with 0 kills and 6 deaths is alive
> Know you're gonna lose this
> Last guy kills everyone on other team


How unboxing works
> Buy a few keys, open something decent
> Get cocky, unboxed 1 decent thing, you must be lucky!
> Unbox a worthless skin
> Take deep breaths, try again
> Get the exact same skin as before
> Cry as you steal your mothers credit card and spend $500 dollars on keys and crates

371,"When I was young, tragedy struck my neighborhood when a bomb went off in a local park. I lost my dear uncle in that accident. Along with my pet cat, two hamsters, one very courageous gold fish, my tickle-me elmo doll, and all of my foil Yu-Gi-Oh cards. It was the first time I experienced tragedy and despair, feelings that cut so deep I vowed to exact revenge upon whoever did this.
I trained every day, running 25 miles a week, lifting weights in 15 pound increments, taking protein supplements as well as spending the majority of my weekends at the firing range. I enlisted in the military, only to be turned down because I was ""only a kid.""
Then, I discovered Counter-Strike;Global Offensive. A perfect simulation of the events I wanted to prevent and take action upon, I was hooked immediately. I threw away my running sneakers for wool socks and sweatpants, as well as a swiveling chair. I put down my weights and protein supplements for Taco Bell and Instant Noodles. I stopped visiting the fire range and instead purchased a Razer gaming mouse.

Worth.
My uncle's still dead though.

399,"Hello and welcome, new player. 
Allow me to reveal some of the likely outcomes of you purchasing this game:

The 'Cannon Fodder' (40% of all players) - Never really good enough to make it past Nova 3, constantly flaming, talking sh it, changing their names and pictures to things increasingly racist, blaming hackers, smurfs, lag and weapon choice of oponents for just what is a mixture of adderall exhausted reflexes and having a shi tty gaming rig from 2002, frame dropping on source games. 
Can be easily identified by it's trademark defence mechanism, when being called out for being bad the Cannon Fodder will attempt to convince it's team it has been 'Trolling' all along.

Habitat: Dust2

The 'Enthusiasts' (30% of all players) - A wide range of Skillsets from Nova Master to around Legendary Eagle, these players can perform consistantly and at least show a basic level of human decency,  most of them will give an unenthusastic hand job for $2.49USD because they feel they are 'due for a knife' or because 'my friend told me he had a feeling' Will one day be doing unspreakable things for a japenese businessman on a glass coffee table to pay off gambling debts that can be traced directly back to a greedy cu nt and his case racket.

Habitat: Dust2, Nuke, Mirage, Cache

The 'C unts' (15% of all players) - A curious breed, come in two distinct flavours 'Hacker' and i mean legit hacker, not hacker because he saw your shadow in bedroom on dust2 and prefired you, you fuc king mook, These are players who either used to or almost fit into the 'Enthusiast Category' and were turned into soulless, spineless dic kbags who cannot win on skill or merit. The other flavour, less cancerous but just as annoying 'Smurfs' people who play at levels far beneath there skill to boost their friends, ruin other peoples day for the joy of being a cu nt or to boost their dwindling ego that is one Sylvia Plath poem away from a stomach full of painkillers in the bathtub.

Habitat: Dust2, Nuke, Mirage, Cache, Train, Overpass, Inferno, Cobblestone, Office, Assault, Any Operation Maps

The 'Pros' (15% of all players) - Professional Esports player OR someone who has played enough CS (usually in excess of 5000 hours - 30 weeks to us humans) to get to a level where they know every smoke, every flash, every angle, every strat on every map and to you i say kudos, kudos on mastering a video game to the point you know it as well as your mothers disappointed face when she looks at you knowing that while normal people are studying, working or contributing to society in someway, you were hunched over your keyboard for the 7th straight hour of the day, mouth breathing in pleasure as that voice says 'Counter Terrorists Win'

401,"Apart from being primarily a game, made for entertainment and competitive purposes, CS:GO is also a powerful personal development tool. Aside from (arguably) improving reaction times and hand-eye coordination, it teaches valuable life lessons, including the following:

 - It teaches you not to pay attention to other people's [strike]insults[/strike] opinions. ""Dude, you are so bad that last night your mom told me you were a mistake.""
 - It teaches to keep your cool in high stress situations, when you have such an adrenaline rush that it seems to be leaking through your pores.
 - It improves your judgment, decision-making and learning process, because the game gives you immediate feedback for any of your actions or inactions. ""Welp, shouldn't have peeked against that guy in the middle.""
- It teaches you to take responsibility. In most game situations, you can only blame yourself when things go wrong.
- It teaches you to enjoy the game, even if you aren't winning. You can't win in life, you can only ease suffering and have a good time once in a while.

Of course, as you could probably notice when interacting with your fellow community members, none of this will happen on its own--unless one pays conscious attention to the situations in the game and the feelings they elicit.",True

But u know what, we have to become a better version of ourselves and don't blame valve for everything i know that they are not trying very hard but u know u and us together we can grow this community more. If u know ur friend is hacker UN-friend him off-course its your choice to do so and yeah reporting works too. And if u r a HACKER AND READING THIS then man!!! go and hack pubg and fortnite bruh!! those games are kind of open world and 99 people to kill im sure you'll have more fun or just play vice city type panzer and go berserk.

So, as to increase the community, please guys don't be toxic, if you play well do not think that everyone will play like you. People have problems like PC, internet or equipment issues. And yeah if you are determined to win then go to competitive MM with known people, create a team, i know it isn't easy but you'll find people. But please in case u want only to have fun or only to win then for god's sake don't play solo queue and ruin other people experience. If you r solo queuing than try to adapt to the team. And as a solo queue person you should be able to do it. And most important don't get angry on new people just try to give them directions not everyone who play csgo want to go pro most of the community people want to have a good time with friends and win.
And about recommending the game, I highly recommend it. And, if anyone from valve reading this please remove the 7-day trading ban, make it 2-day.

435,"[h1]My Thoughts and Opinions on CS:GO[/h1]
CS:Go is one of those games that has a really dedicated and rabid fanbase thanks to incredible success of Counter Strike 1.6. Released in 2012 and eight years later, the fast-paced PC game still mostly holds its own against more modern titles, partly because of its established core gameplay and huge active community.
A big part of its success is due to its massive esports following. It’s always talked about in streaming sites whether its Twitch and Mixer. The game even includes its own ""watch a match"" section so you can follow and spectate live tournaments and competitive matches.
CS:GO is also very easily accessible. It’s free and all you need is a potato with a fine keyboard and mouse and maybe a headset with a mic. It runs on basically any PC with decent frames rate. A High-End PC should give you over 300fps at ultra-details. You don’t need anything fancy or powerful to enjoy which is another reason why there’s so big player base. 

[h1]Pros[/h1]
+Valve has done everything it can to evolve the game and keep it fresh by staying true to the series.
+One of the greatest competitive first-person shooters you can play on Steam
+Massive player base and a game that refuses to die!
+Includes several maps and nine game modes types including the standard team based PvP casual modes, competitive, deathmatch, arms race, community made maps and servers and even a 16 player Battle Royale mode (but you shouldn’t really play it for Battle Royale as its mostly barebones and ugly).
+100% skill-based gameplay and no casual power-ups like seen in Halos and Call of Duty. 
+CS: GO relies heavily on reaction time and twitchy movements. Thus, line-of-sight is one of the biggest advantages you can create.
+Excellent sound design (but very unrealistic at the same time).
+Bullet physics and explosions are still impressive for an engine that is now 16 years old.
+Excellent performance. Runs well even on potatoes and 10-year-old PCs and laptops.
+An example of “games as a service” done well.

[h1]Cons[/h1]
-Well, you’ll often find some gamers helpful and tolerable to newbies, the mass playerbase is unwelcoming and very toxic. Playing without friends is not recommended.
-Negative behavior includes trolls in the team chats, people who scream into their mics, and people who simply can't keep quiet :D Some of them might even vote to kick you out because you're new to CS.
-Plenty of hackers and cheaters that ruin the fun and fair-play for everyone. VAC engine is mostly automated and not moderated by Valve's employees unless during a few rare cases. The anti-cheat is okay but not any better than other anti-cheat solutions seen on PC. So yeah! Cheating exist nearly everywhere these days.
-Technically CS:Go looks very dated and mediocre. It hasn’t changed a lot from CS: Source. The graphics are mediocre and 2008ish. Graphics haven’t improved relatively much since 2004’s Half Life 2.
-Aggressive monetization to the point it’s become a live gambling show. Players can choose to spend real money on items and cosmetic material like weapon skins. Winning and completing tasks rewards you loot boxes that can be unlocked by purchasing keys with real money!!! Too much trading could even lead to online gambling addiction. 

[h1]The Bottom Line[/h1]
CS:GO is one of the most fine-tuned first-person shooters to date. Sure, while it may look like a 15-year-old game and there might be major issues, but the fact that the community is thriving speaks volumes, this means that this game will constantly be tweaked towards perfection.

439,"Let me clear this out, as a person who has kinda a lot of experience on the game, I can say u that every country has their stereotype on this game. This game can make the most normal person in the world into a raging toxic machine who is flaming everybody and gets depressed after losing one round.
So let me start on the stereotypes:

Russian/Poland/Ukraine people: Oh boy where I can start. Very self driven and they not care about you and they can f*** up with your head just by speaking their language even if u asked them something in english, skill wise they suck, there are some good russian/polish/ukraine players but its rare to find them if you do you're lucky. Chances are low to kick  them beacuse they go premade with friends just not to get kicked beacuse they know they suck.

British people: The most arrogant people out there you can't argue with them never ever even when you have a point they will still switch it up and they will not care about your opinion, they will always say your english sucks beacuse english is their main language. Skill wise I must say by my experience one of the most skilled ones, but it can happen you find a bad player from Britain but chances are low.

French/German/Belgium/Spanish/Holland/Italian people: They are the most normal ones, if u flame them they will flame you back, but in most situations they are normal and chill, skill wise its a 50/50 chance a good or bad player will come, beacuse the normal ones are mostly the avarage players.

Turkish people: A better version of the Russians, they can't speak english well, they kinda suck, but they're special beacuse if u found out somebody is cheating on the enemy team I can guarantee you that the cheater is 80% from Turkey and he's playing with his Turkish friends on full stack. There are some good players, but chances are low to find them just like the Russian ones. They love Dust and they can't play any other map.

Balkan people: There's everything in them toxicity, skill everything you can think of. Guys older than 20 from the Balkans are mostly chill and very good at the game. But the under 20 like me, oh boy watch yourself, the young ones are skillful, but they're very toxic, but they're not self driven just like the Brits, they know who's better than them and who's worse than them and they will listen to the ones with more experience. Balkan people also are not that patient they can lose their cool when you do something stupid even if you're winning so watch out.

Swedish/Norway/Finland/Denmark: I don't really know what to say about them 80% are chill and very friendly but the rest 20% are the most toxic ones, skill wise they are great, for me the best in the world but the 20% I mentioned are the biggest noobs getting carried by their friends. They communicate great and are the most chill ones. 

I'm not a person who can judge but this is from my perspective, so if you read this don't feel offended it's a personal opinion.

The game would be good if the anti_cheat was better. The problem with CS:GO is the more you hate it the more you love it. But the game is good tho.",True

442,"I am JokemL, and I am a CS:GO player. I have played 3000+ hours, over multiple accounts. I have now decided to write a ""little"" review.

I cannot remember that much from when I first got the game, but it went something like this:

Play one game-quit-next day-play one game-quit, and that went on for a little while.
Now that I am a little older and know the game better then I did just 6-7 years ago, I can tell you what I like and dislike about this game.

Starting with what I like about this game:
I like that there is a solid community around the game, though there is alot of scammers/hackers/others, but there is always someone kind just around the corner.

When I started playing CS I liked the pistols on CT cause I felt like I was in the police force. I also liked the AWP and the Ak-47 cause of the insane damage I got with it. I did not really use the other guns, but other people played better with it.

The game felt really good at the start and I was ready to become a pro. Getting a rank was not a big deal for me at the time, only playing Deathmatch or Gun Game most of the time. I cannot even remember my first ever rank.

My tips to new players: Do not care about what rank you get. Start by having fun and playing on your own level.

After watching a lot of videos on how to get better and improve this and that, I started playing more seriously. Changing my settings to what the pros had, Using other crosshairs, viewmodels and such. I started playing better and doing better on the scoreboard.

I started warming up everyday to keep me on the level I was. Playing with friends that have good game sence and microphones, and having good communication was the key to a better experience and a happy rankup.

And there is a lot more people that posts tips and tricks.

What I dislike about the game: 

Starting with Hackers. There is always going to be some kind of cheaters in CS and that it's hard for valve to ban them all, but I think they could do better.
The amount of hackers I meet on a daily bases is just insane, example wingman. In wingman there is atleast one hacker in 1-3 matches, and I have reported so many of them and up to 20% of they have been banned but up to 80% of they still allowed to play on valve secured servers. This is a problem.

Toxic. You may have heard the word toxic before, you may even be toxic. There is alot of players that are toxic, saying bad words to you, been hateful towards you, telling you that you are bad and things like that.
This is a problem that will never be solved, just because of how many plays the game and how many people that gets mad if someone is bad or you losing a game. 
Toxic players is hard to deal with and you have to either mute him or just try to talk to him in a normal way.

Scammers. Scammers is also a thing that ruins the game for most people.
To lose alot of money because of a scammer is not the most fun thing on this planet.
it has happened to me aswell, loseing over $200 cause of a scam is not fun at all.
Thats why you always should double check every trade you do. (Don't trust people over the internet)

I love operations, but it takes so long before the next operation, so we just sit and wait for over 1 year...
This is something that makes me a little angry. CS is the same over and over again and that is not a bad thing, but we would love to sit back and relax with a operation.

Overall I like this game and I think you would like it aswell.

CS:GO is a very fun and entertaining game, especially matchmaking with my friends in 5Stack gives me great pleasure. From time to time you might meet a cheater or have a toxic griefer in the team, but all in all I have had very few bad experiences and hope it stays that way for now.
For all those who are a little frustrated with CS:GO I can only recommend - play the game with friends, it is a big difference if you play alone or together!

Game looks much more amazing, and the physics is better i think also love the new type of granades , gave the game some new dimensions. Unfortunately only thing that is ruining all the fun is insane amount of cheaters, lately its very hard to get a game without at least one. This made a lot of my friends that came back to cs to quit playing it, because sometime there is no fun in it if you play against obvious cheaters. Valve will have to find out a fast and effective solution for this, its becoming and epidemic illness for cs go. Hope you solve it cause i love this game!

455,"Counter-Strike: Global Offensive (CS:GO) expands upon the team-based action gameplay that it pioneered when it was launched 20 years ago.

CS: GO features new maps, characters, weapons, and game modes, and delivers updated versions of the classic CS content (de_dust2, de_mirage, de_train, de_inferno, de_nuke etc.).

""Counter-Strike took the gaming industry by surprise when the unlikely MOD became the most played online PC action game in the world almost immediately after its release in August 1999,"" said Doug Lombardi at Valve. ""For the past 12 years, it has continued to be one of the most-played games in the world, headline competitive gaming tournaments and selling over 25 million units worldwide across the franchise. CS: GO promises to expand on CS' award-winning gameplay and deliver it to gamers on the PC as well as the next gen consoles and the Mac.""",True

464,"Counter Strike: Global Offensive, the remake of the classic CS games and not to our surprise, the devs did a good job. One of the lovely things about it, that of had not been kept I seriously doubt the game would be as popular as it is currently, it keeps the mechanics from the classic CS and CS:S and adds a few of it's own, that the original CS and CS:S games could have done with. CS’s weak point was always the graphics, the original games were based of the HL1 engine, which I am sure all you are aware is reasonably old, although it’s added a new range of updated maps, including two operations. The most recent being Operation Bravo in which a number of maps were added to the game as DLC. And once again, Valve have decided to take the generous approach to this, an example is that if the lobby leader has the Operation Bravo pass, and no one else does, everyone can play Op. Bravo, good job Valve, you did it again. What was missing/wrong with this game has been fixed by Valve, which is fantastic. Items have been added, you can have gun camos which is an nifty feature, although many think it's turning into TF2, which is a valid point, but Valve need there money, if you take a look at the price of the game, it’s not exactly the same as COD (ew) which has a hefty price tag of £40 ($60 I think) and CSGO managed to do fine at £12, which I think is $15 in the US.


Sadly I did not play the original CS, I have however obviously seen gameplay, and watched friends play it. I have played a small amount of CS:S and compared it to CSGO, which was considerably easy, some of the main differences are simply that the problems that those games have/had have been completely eradicated from CSGO which is brilliant. Such as small things that could be exploited in competitive games, such as the saving mechanic. In CS if you die, you lose all your weapons, they will be dumped on the ground for another enemy to come along and pickup, players if they knew they were going to use they would hide away from the enemies, so they would be able to keep there gun for the next around, the problem with this is that they would still get money from doing this, and therefore be exploiting the system in some peoples opinion, it was recently fixed that instead of getting money if you lose and you’re still alive you simply gain $0.

The CSGO match making system is an exceptional feature, the ability to play against players that are at the same skill level is much better than being forced to browse through thousands of servers in attempt to find one that suits you with a enemy team you can play against, and it is a fun game for both teams instead of one team getting obliterated by the other. Matchmaking works by waiting till you have 10 wins or 9 wins and a draw on your account before being rewarded with a competitive rank. Here are all the current ranks available in game. 
http://www.pro-hl.com/images/prohl/csgo_ranks.jpg
Many people seem to think that this is like COD, you simply rank up from playing the game, no this is not true. You rank up as your skill improved, if you play well for a few weeks, and you finally get the Gold Nova you’ve been wanting for ages, and then you proceed to play awfully for a long time there is a very likely chance you will be deranked sadly, it’s for the best, you will be matched against players who are around the same skill level.

Recently a feature that allowed you to watch your recent games has been implemented into the game, this is in now way “ground breaking” it’s been done by other games before, but they have there issues, although I have not got round to actually trying out this feature I have been told that it appears to be working considerably well. The watch feature is great for those who enjoy re watching those moments of which they pulled of that beautiful AWP shot, or got that 5-kill ace.

I would like to say in this final paragraph, of the 250 hours+ I have played of this game I have seriously enjoyed (almost) every moment of it, sure there are some hackers, but you have to make sure to report them and they will be dealt with. All the factors about this game are good, but as all games go by, they have there problems, sure if CSGO has improved graphics that would be nice, and if *breathes in heavily* VALVE WOULD ADD 128 TICK MATCH MAKING SERVERS… this has caused some annoyance for me in match making, if you don’t understand what’s so bad about 64 tick, I suggest you watch this video:
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J6u26YTpIF0
Anyway, I highly suggest you buy this game, apart from my small rant at the end, and game is fine, good game mechanics, graphics are sort of good, I supposed most of the maps are well balanced, there are a few that I suggest you shouldn’t play though. The game has a small price tag, which I am sure will attract you to it even more, especially when it’s on sale at 75% of!

Hope you enjoyed reading my game review of Counter Strike: Global Offensive, and that this assisted you in making the decision of whether to buy the game or not.

489,"Counter-Strike:Global Offensive is a game developed by Valve, it is extemely difficult considering you have to wrangle your teammates, manage your economy, predict your enemies' economy, buy the correct sh*t then aim for the head and spray correctly; then there is a bunch of extra sh*t like grenades, objectives, utility and whatever the fu*k not; it's not a game for everyone, you have to be really good with your mouse, there is a story that someone was so good with his mouse, he bacame the mouse, the mouse permanently fused into his hand, now he has to use his other hand for certain things; the game has multiple maps including Dust 2, which is the only map, and Mirage but Mirage just really isn't working these days; the game will bring you many fun experiences like playing with Aldon Hilter as he only buys a Negev and unpolitely refuses to buy anything else as we lose 14-16 against 4 bots; this game is fun in the words of a certain person this is fu*king gameplay: you can play as the terrorists and blow sh*it up while praising the one god or you can play as the counter terrorists who counter the terrorists terrorizing terrorism; some of the guns are: the Deagle, the AK-47, the P90, the AWP, but the most important and deadliest of all is the decoy grenade, not many people know that every Decoy grenade is sent from the deepes circle of hell where the souls of the damned are burned and seared alive for all eternity; on your journey to become better at this game you will encounter smurfs, non-billingual russians, toxicity, mute people, people who make you realise that CS:GO causes metaphysical retardation or at least will make you conider that being true, but the worst of all the people who type ""Nice Try"" after you fu*king fail your shi*ty clutch attempt; there are a lot of mods for the game like bunny hopping servers, 1v1 servers, surfing servers, Jailbreak, and a lot of other stuff; I almost forgot to mention the skins, every single gun can be cosmetically customized if you have the money, every skin is different and has a different price ranging your generic pistol skin to a 1600$ knife skin; it's a great game, it's also perfectly fu*king free, so go get it.",True

491,"Want a real and honest review? Here you go:

Used to be one of the best FPS games out there. At this point the game is so broken and badly maintained. Dev's don't listen to the players and just do things to the game nobody wanted.

What players asked: New missions and 128-tick servers. What do we get? We get some nice updates of never wanted gloves with free game breaking addons. Oh how about we give you a nice new sound system nobody wanted just because we can.

Let's talk about the VAC system (Valve Anti Cheat):
Probally one of the worst working anti cheat systems out there. People can go spinbotting / wallhacking ingame without insta triggering red flags, no they just get a some people in overwatch after 10 reports looking at it. Instead of building a better VAC system to help keep the game fun and fair, they give us gloves and game breaking addons.
But I guess if they made the VAC system better half of the pro's out there get insta banned and then it's bye bye CS:GO.  

Soon 1.000 hours for me, never had a higher then 0.03€ skin drop, a friend of mine played, gets a 250€ M4A1-S drop with his first deathmatch... It's random but maybe recode it so things like this don't happen because it absolut BS.

But after all, I enjoy the game even tho 1/3 games gives a hacker and 1/2 games give a high chance of dropping you in a game full of russians.

VALVE, fix your game like the PEOPLE want it:
- 128-tick servers
- Better VAC system, even tho half the pro's gets banned
- Fix bugs in the game / maps instead of adding gloves just to get more money
- Different servers for RU / EU with no way to mix those together
- Fix those damn hitboxes
- Add that's it recommended to have a microphone and have some basic English knowledge.

Game: 8/10 Good game in general, could use some better hitboxes
Maps: 7/10 Some maps just have so low FPS for people it's unplayable
Dev's: 5/10 Give a lot broken updates but fixes them more or less within 2 weeks
Servers: 6/10 Some Valve servers are laggy and they should be split between RU / EU / Asia / US
 
Total: 6.5/10

[b] Story: [/b]


Police versus Terrorists. You play on either of this sides.
Differenced in gameplay: You want to secure something from beeinng blown up or blew it up.
Alternative you have to secure hostages or stop the SWAT securering them.

[b] Gameplay: [/b]

Easy to learn but hard to master. Forget about running with an Assault Rifle and give headshots to everyone like in other FPS. For this you have to choose the P-90. 
No seriously it took some time to know how to control the spray of your weapons.

Just pressing the fire button is not enough here. CS is still one of the most skill and game-sense required games.

To help you mastering this you can download and play training maps from the workshop.

[b] Introduction [/b]
Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is a First Person Shooter set in a comptetetive scene where two teams battle for an objective. It is a stand-alone follow-up to the famous Counter-Strike mod from Half-Life where terrorists battle the Counter-Terrorists on different locations.

[b] Gameplay & Story: 6/10 [/b]
The gameplay consists of buying weapons and shooting your opponents. Easier said than done actually, since your opponents are either human players sitting on the other side of the world wide web or some AI programmed to shoot you first. CS:GO is for a reason the biggest competetive shooter on the market for years, since it offers great weapon balance, tactical possibilities for teams to approach and a large player base that keeps growning each day. The story behind the game is based on the oldschool Counter-Strike game, where one side takes the approach as terrorists either trying to plant a bomb or protect the hostages and other being Counter-Terrorists either try to protect a bomb site or trying to rescue the hostages held at Terrorist base. 

[b] Combat & Challenge : 8/10 [/b]
The combat is absolutely fluid in CS:GO and there are barely any moments, that you could blame the broken hitboxes or the bad netcode for dying. People tend to rage and blame the bad balance on maps, weapons or programming of the game, however the success of this title proves that it is the best competetive shooter on the market. The challenge in this game is definetely to be able to rise through the ranks in competetive matches, playing against hackers on opposite team or some players on your team that want to teach you some bad words in russian or french. I am always thankful for such opportunities to improve my language skills and consider it just a chance of becoming even better if I did not win the match no matter the team stacks. Reaching Global Elite rank after around 200 hours, I can safely say that it is possible to rise to the top even when the odds are stacking against you.

[b] Graphic & Interface : 7/10 [/b]
The graphic when set to higher settings is actually pretty good, sadly the competetive scene barely allows it since there are certain tricks like setting your resolution lower on purpose to be able to aim better, that crash the feeling of this game in graphical matters. Most of the maps contain some details that make them distinguishable, like certain grapphiti on some maps. The interface is kept simple and almost transparent so that it does not disturb the concentration.

[b] Progress & Mini-Games : 8/10 [/b]
It is possible to consider progress by rising up the account level that comes from simply playing CS:GO in any form, there are forms of rising up your ranking by playing competetive or gathering skins for the weapons you are using or want to sell. Some people actually make money by playing this game and selling the skins on the steam market, so different ways to progress in and outside of the game. The biggest progress for me was improving my hand-to-eye coordination by playing it competetively.

[b] Audio & Immersion : 8/10 [/b]
Each weapon sound is unique for itself, and since the sound plays a great role in this game it is really important to get to know the sounds and be able to distinguish where the shooting is coming from. CS:GO fulfills its task really well. The music is played only in menues and during the highlights. The game music is nothing special, but since you can get/buy music kits to fit your music taste, Valve found a good workaround for not creating amazing music by themselves.

[b] Side-Notes [/b]
[list]
[*]This game offers single player, multiplayer and co-op modes that can be played either against other players or AI.
[*]This game offers different modes, some of that are just for fun, for example gun mode, while others are played in E-Sports.
[*]This game contains steam achievements.
[*]This game offers great optimization and updates to technology with time (updating their network code, updating the hit boxes, balancing the weapons).
[/list]

[b] Summary [/b]
CS:GO has its reasons to be the Number One FPS in the ESL Scene and its popularity is currently only rising. It is great to see that it has not been abandoned by the developers after reaching its peak state, but still keeps getting updated. I would recommend trying CS:GO to every game, just to know what this game is that defines the global FPS market so much and while FPS fans might love it, some might well get turned off by the hardcore players or the cursing and spitting wanna-bes.

[*] This game is the epitome of reflex. I love this game because it's simple yet the most complex of strategies can be implied. It doesn't just test your mechanical skill but also makes you really put in a mental effort. Really fun in a competitive 5 man lobby. 
[*] Thank heavens this game enables you to access the settings menu whilst queuing for a match.. it was due for years. The new UI seems innovative but I suppose there is still more room for improvement.
[*] Having about an average number of hours. here's what the pros and cons of this game are to me- 
[/list]
Pros: 
[olist]
[*] If you love a fast paced competitive game, this is the game for you.
[*] Simple (no breaking walls and shit) yet it's fun and there's a lot of shit you can do to achieve success - victory, fun, both; whatever objective you have set for yourself/definition you have set for the word. 
[*] Could also make a great game to play casually between other games, you find these kinds of players mostly in the lower ranks. 
[*] In-game ranking system to motivate you on a short-term to play more and get better. 
[*] Besides the Competitive (classic 5v5) game mode, there are many others you can choose from. Community made maps and skins to give you a better experience.
[*] Being updated regularly- new maps, changes in existing maps, changes in the economy in-game, etc,- leads to creating new metas. 
[*] 3rd party matchmaking clients (ESEA, SoStronk, Faceit) offer more opportunities with more stable and better servers (128 tick), tournaments over various periods of time, in-built ranking system with lots of prizes to be won- really brings out the most out of this game- thus leading to a newer and better experience, for the ones who take this game seriously and for the ones who play casually both alike. 
[*] Very active and an entertaining e-sport scene- the content it provides really shows that humans are capable of the impossible.
[*] Pretty cool community, I've played a lot of other games and have been a part of many communities but I've got to say the CS:GO community is pretty cool. We have one of the smartest, one of the most humorous communities on Twitch, Reddit and on YouTube, unlike in other games where at least one of these platforms are more cancerous than the better part of them. And ah, some extremely attractive female streamers and pro players.
[/olist]
Cons-

[*] Matchmaking servers are the worst... I don't know what the devs have planned for this game. The servers are never stable and really ruins the experience for us. This game was at a point where all of us were gonna request Valve to upgrade the MM servers to 128 tick but really need to resort to 3rd party clients and many of us really don't want to do that ALL the time or cannot.
[*] So many bugs and stuff being abused in maps and this game takes forever to get them fixed.
[*] I know this is a long shot since it took them years to make other sub-menus accessible while in queue for a match.. but would be fuckin GREAT if we had the option to [b]choose servers[/b]. Indians and Pinoys are literally the worst. I'm not generalising but you know it makes no difference to generalise or not because I've never had a good experience with players from these nations. They RUIN our games. Can't have one fun match without an incompetent Indian crying on the mic in Hindi about some really dumb shit. Like just shut the FUCK UP dude. Always looking for something to blame, extremely annoying when they rush first, die and then comment on what you're doing and if you don't do as they say they just have a mental breakdown on mic. Thank goodness this game is capable of a block communication feature. I don't even know how they get to the ranks they do with their intellectually incapable selves. They're extremely bad and just hold your team down. Super toxic. I don't mind losing because it's a fair part of the game but the games are just RUINED by these players. Coming from overpopulated countries where they don't get enough attention or where they can't get any due to the lack of a special talent, they just show their frustration on the mic and ruin the experience for us. Videos on YouTube get super popular in the CS:GO communities and these players just try out tricks/tips/ whatever BUGS they've discovered etc. and because of their incompetency they fail and it isn't fun nor productive. Request to all Indian and Filipinos- please do not try out the stuff you see on videos. They hold an IQ threshold that you people cannot match. It only ruins our games. And I'm sure every region has some shit like this so it's only fair CS:GO let's us choose our servers to reduce the risk of getting into a game with an Indian or whoever with an underdeveloped brain.
[*] Hackers and smurfs are still into existence despite the efforts of Valve. It bums me the fuck out because I've exchanged a lot more time and effort to get to the same rank as the hacker or smurf did only to get paired against them for a definite loss in elo points.  Ruined the game after it became f2p. 
[*] After this game turned f2p the servers became WORSE due to the high load and they removed the option to report servers. It's like they knew it was bound to happen. Great, the game struggled with stable mm servers and now make the game f2p and introduce the shittiest Battle Royale in existence - Danger Zone. 
[*] Poorly optimised game, anybody that gets <250 fps know the huge drop in fps when in smokes etc. 
[/olist]
Hope Valve does something about the servers and add more features to this game instead of funding some shit p2w garbage like ARTIFACT that nobody gives a fuck about. 

-Tips for new players: 
1. Get some friends to play with to begin with. More known players more the merrier.
2. You can completely customise how the games looks for you. Crosshair, viewmodel etc can be adjusted for your convenience. Make use of it.
3. Watch videos. 
4. Indians/Pinoys on your team or general mic cancer teammates? Type enable_voice 0 in console.. you're welcome.

Conclusion: It's a fun game if you've a taste for competitiveness. Lower skill curve yet hard to master. 8/10 would recommend it.
My first review and it's long as FUCK I don't think most of you would read it- but for those who have regardless of whether you relate to my review or not, thank you for spending time on this. Really appreciate it.  Sorry for any mistakes I've committed and have not noticed to change them.",True

567,"Counter strike is a lovely game with a lovely community, its a perfect place for a malignant narcissist to flourish. If you love friendly interactions from all sorts of Ethnicities then this is your game.
Pros
1. You can slowly get the money you paid for the game back with 1p drops in game
2. If your rich you can show all the peasants how cool your knives look and make all the Russian children trade in their grain stores to buy a sand dune nova.
3. Kill Terrorist ( big thumbs up from American players)
4. A deep and engrossing story line and ranking system with so much context into the terrorists motivations.

Cons
1.Terrorists are evil and no one tells me why, the game should be more politically correct or call them freedom, fighters.
2. Game is old and I cant kill ISIS, may change in the future if valve wants to make this game an immersive experience. 
3. Lots of children with horrible voices that make you want to use a cheese grater on your skull.
4. If you have friends you wont have them long as you will rage every time they let you die leading to you pouring piping hot tea on your sisters face. 
5. All developed nations decide to allow their troops to go to battle without body Armour making them spend their salary on equipment - 40000 immersion points.
6. If you are British there is a whole wealth of opportunities to hear constant slaughtering of your language and a barrage of Tea hate which will be most disturbing. 

In conclusion this Game is Fantastic with its revolutionary graphics, sweet jumpers for some terrorist and a real look into counter terrorism operations.",True
568,"You cannot be called a PC gamer if you have never played Counter-Strike before.

As a new series that was born from a franchise that was so phenomenal in the past, Valve must be recognized as having succeeded in bringing Counter Strike: Global Offensive in the right direction. On the one hand, it meets the needs of all gamers who could feel the charm of this game in the past. He created the same atmosphere with nostalgic nuances that were so obvious with various elements that were presented in it, from just a map to the gameplay mechanism itself.

It’s still the same old Counter Strike that we know!",True
569,"Both the competitive and guilty pleasure in my entire Steam library, CS:GO has captured both these conflictive aspects of mine spectacularly, as I've enjoyed over hundreds of hours, playing this joyous game. From the teamwork, player rankings, campaigns, competitive gameplay, music, replay value and much more, this game is a king amongst most modern, multi-player FPS' games and still going strong even over just a measly three years.

Just like its predecessors, the player assumes the role of either a counter-terrorist or a terrorist, both with their own unique missions, depending on the campaign in general. The newly added campaigns, Deathmatch and Arms race is a great exclusive extra if you're just a casual player, whereas there's the competitive session for the more experienced, intense and determined players out there.

With every match starting, you're brought into ''Freeze time.'' where you have a wide selection of guns in your disposal, just ready to be bought, either with the money you've earned by killing opponents, or indeed losing a match respectively, still giving the losing team a winning chance. While with your team, you could stick together as there are power in numbers, or go alone to face your opposing enemies. I wouldn't talk for every individual player out there, as I've seen power in experienced players. Trust me, I have witnessed a Russian veteran take down an entire army of 5 opponents, all in the same vicinity...and yes, he was a rageful one, indeed.

I also enjoyed the updated graphics and more immersive game environments. Definitely pushing the Source engine to its absolute limits but doesn't go too over the edge to miss the most important aspect of any game; the gameplay. The gameplay is near to being absolutely perfect, as you can easily navigate, along with the controls are fast and (sometimes) responsive, on the other hand, the radar being very relieable even in the most threatening of times, since you can detect enemies close to your location and either wait for them or hunt them down yourself or with your precious, numbered team. Just remember to tune down your mouse settings for aiming, as it does help much more.

The original music used is also a big step up, as it literally puts you into that zone of actually being prepared for one living frenzy of a match, each time around. From the beginning beat as you select your weapon and gear you will bring into combat each time, or from hearing the threatening tune of the planted bomb ticking away down to its initial explosion, the music definitely makes the game feel and look more surreal than it already is. And with an added bonus, with the Steam music player at its peak in popularity, the update with the musical kit useable in-game was a great move, as you can listen to classic music, as you slaughter your opponents joyfully.

I've also enjoyed the gun descriptions that tell the real-life history and origin in a very formal, informative and creative way. The statistics of the weapons also help out the player to figure out what weapon they will bring out, either if it means getting close and personal with a shotgun, sniping away with a rifle from a distance and even switching to second-hand pistols, when reloading your main gun that takes precious time, along with how they flesh out damage with a great, controlled accuracy. As you can tell, this game serves many different ideas, strategies, preferences and possibilities to each and every person who are against each other.

And yet another great thing to note is that this game gets multiple, yet fast updates. The homepage of the game mainly dishes out the latest CS:GO news, such as upcoming streaming matches with clans from different countries going toe to toe, or special deal offers on those elusive cases, if you're ever tempted to test your luck and hopefully get a rare skin to add to your growing collection of weapon skins. You can also create clans and watch your ranking system build up with friends and even create lobbies to secure that you will be in the most competitive games with your mates behind your back.

But my primary complaint with this wonderful game has got to be...the community. Yes, a lot of aspiring programmers and artists do a swell job at creating fantastic weapon skins and maps that when judged are simply classified as prefessional, but I'm not talking about those great people. I'm talking about the brash players that exemplify the dunning-kruger affect; where unskilled players rate their own abilities much higher than accurate and compare other players, in a much more biased fashion. It gets annoying pretty quickly, so I would usually block the most revolting swines who do this.

All in all, this game is a big, big, big recommendation from me and if you think I'm lying, just check top-selling games list at the start of the Steam page. There's a reason why this game is on the high ranking list, and that's due to its high and successful popularity.",True
570,"Coming from someone who was a teenager when Atari's were the ""go-to"" gaming system, I've seen video games evolve from 2-D pixels to full blown reality. I first heard about Counter Strike after I found out about The Orange Box on my X-box console which led me to finding out about Counter Strike Source which I later got to experience on my buds PC. This led me to creating a steam account. I really enjoyed CSS and even got into a group of experienced players. Every weekend we would all get together with other semi competitive groups to play against each other. Fast forward a decade after lots of health issues and family problems I started getting back into video games and come to find out about Counter Strike Global Offensive. Seeing the new and improved versions of the maps and bombsites we used to spar for really kick-started my interest in playing again. Fast forward I bought myself a powerful computer and created a new account after spending weeks trying to recollect my old login in my now not so sharp brain. Haha to sum it up this game has really helped a old man enjoy his days and feel young again. Thank you",True

Ingredients:
1. 6 tablespoons unsalted butter
2. 1/2 cup white sugar
3. 1/2 cup brown sugar
4. 1/4 cup water
5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon
6. 1 pinch salt
7. 5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced
8. 1 pastry for double-crust pie 

Directions:
1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.
3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.
4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.
5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.
6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing.",True

600,"ANSWER A COMMON AND IMPORTANT QUESTION 
Is there really much cheater in this game?

Well, the truth cannot be hidden ... Many big hackers, due to the excessive popularity of this game, update their cheats daily and provide it to a many of players.

But the main problem is that many times we do not face cheaters we face We face low self-esteem, low morale and low skills

From one level onwards, the players are so well prepared that we think the other side must be cheated to be able to aim our heads from a long distance with just one shot ak 47 in a very short time.
Instead of grumbling, raise your level

PROS: [+]
-Great community (COMPARED TO SOME OTHER GAMES)
-Frequent updates
-Tradable stuff
-Source Engine means that players from GMod, CS 1.6/Source, etc. won't (or at least shouldn't) have a hard time adapting to new controls and physics.
-VERY Competitive at higher levels
-Tons of workshop files and tons of room to make your own skins and maps
-Weapon skins 
-Multiple modes for casual or competitive and more
-High FPS on almost any PC (great optimization)

CONS: [-]
-Skins can be expensive or worthless
-Skins and cases can suck the money out of you if you let it
-Recoil is not very easy to get used to
-No aiming down sights (FOR NEW PEOPLE, CALM DOWN VETS)
-Cooldowns can be handed out unfairly
-Low graphic quality/detail compared to other games (IT IS SOURCE, CALM DOWN)
-MP only (if you are reading this, you most likely have internet at home, THERE IS A BOTS ONLY OPTION)
-Hackers do like to hack in competitive matches at higher levels
-Callouts are not that easy to learn for beginners

OVERALL:
Get it. If it is on sale, CS:GO is an even better deal. The recoil was my biggest challenge at the start but just take some time to practice with bots. Perfect for traders, casual FPS players, competitive FPS players, and workshop content creators.

641,"Counter-Strike makes you work to enjoy the content, and you'll have to put many hours of play into it before enjoying the feeling of conquering it.

Weapons are a huge part of the series too, with CS:GO not an exception. Each round provides a cash sum based on your previous performance, and with this you can purchase armour, projectiles and weapons. Firearms range from standard assault rifles to shotguns and sniper rifles, and you'll want to experiment with each one to see which works best.

What makes Counter-Strike such a popular series - and what will no doubt make CS:GO the next big PC shooter - is the thrill of the ego chase. As you die, often continuously, the frustration is outweighed by an aspiration to do better. In a game where success is pinned on attention to detail, death often triggers an internal failure analysis that the player will mull over while waiting for a new session to load. It becomes a spiral of egging yourself on to do better - and if you become a good player, the game becomes a stage for you to parade your skills.

Global Offensive builds on the CS series by going through a significant checklist presented by its community and marking off as many points as possible. Gun game as its own separate mode? Check. Competitive capabilities built in? Check! Map balancing here and there? Check, check, check.

As a result, there are numerous upgrades that will adjust gameplay while also making accessibility far better. The wide range of grenades, for example, will likely make play more tactical - laying down incendiary grenades will thwart rushes, while decoys, which fake gunfire and fool radar points, are brilliant tools for messing with the minds of established players.

The actual core shooting will be a huge talking point for many months to come. It has been tinkered slightly and gives weapons a noticeably floaty feel, which doesn't sit well to begin with. We eventually found ourselves enamoured by it, and the impact of hits add a real tactile distinction to play.

It's what doesn't work, however, that is most notable. Regular mode has no new maps added to it, while all the new guns seem somewhat cosmetic. Global Offensive has also removed some of its middling weapons such as the MP5, essentially pushing even more players to stick with the AK and the M4. Sometimes it gives the impression that there is in fact less valuable content than in previous CS releases.

If one assumed this was Counter-Strike Source with a visual mod installed, there would often be little to shake that impression.

There's also now a split between casual and competitive servers - however, many players aren't yet aware of the differences, mainly because the distinction isn't made obvious enough. It becomes even more confusing if you join a community server with all hosts of mods installed on it, which have perhaps taken casual mode, turned friendly fire on and essentially made it as close to Source as possible.

At times, arranging games in Competitive Mode feels like a chore. Joining a five-on-five war is simple enough, but attempt to lobby up with a group of friends and join a game, and you'll often hit a snag. Myself and a few others tried to find a competitive game with no luck, simply being told that no servers were currently available.

When you finally do join, it works fine, but the wait and work required to find a game seems like a drawback. We eventually gave up and resorted to using IRC to find matches, as we would with Source.

Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is not the key evolution point that we were hoping for, and the response from the community often reflects this view. On many occasions, other players used phrases such as ""same old"" to us.

This is elementally Counter-Strike Source with some fine-tuning under the bonnet, and Valve appears to have acknowledged this with the reasonable RRP attached to it.

And yet the core DNA of the game has not lost its appeal. This is still a glorious experience that sets a benchmark for all multiplayer shooters. Valve's objective with Global Offensive was to draw together the active communities of both the Source and trusty 1.6 edition. It clearly has a good chance.",True

656,"[h1] CS:GO review from a free account [/h1]
Counter-strike: Global Offensive is a game in which two teams (One Terrorist, and the other Counter Terrorist) try to prevail against the other. The Terrorists try to plant the bomb at one of two sites or wipe out the other team, and the Counter terrorists try to stop the terrorists from accomplishing their tasks. 

[u] Pros: [/u]
Can be free to play (with limitations)- If you choose to play CS without upgrading your account, you can still play all of the game modes. It is actually pretty good for a free game. You cannot receive drops or a rank however. Steam cards are also not available to free accounts

Good multiplayer game- CS can be played with teams of 5 friends if you queue up in competitive mode. Cs also has the largest player base of any game on steam, so there are always people to play with.

Game is updated regularly- CS receives updates on the regular, and operations are added yearly (as of the date of this review)

Number of hackers lessened- In my experience, the number of hackers in this game has been greatly reduced over the years. I am playing on a new free to play account (an alt) to test this, and it does seem to hold up

[u] Cons: [/u]
hacking is still prevalent in csgo

The ranking system is hard to understand- You may lose a game and de-rank, then go on to win 5 games with no rank up. You need to be patient with the ELO system

There are not many gamemodes- To be fair, they have been updating cs and introduced things like short comp matches 


Overall, csgo is a fun game, and if you dont care about getting a rank, a free to play account works well for your needs. I initially played casual for the first 2 years of my csgo gameplay (back in 2015). If you dont care about comp and ranks, this is essentially what a free account can offer you. You can get into games, and even play competitive mode these days without it being ranked. It is a fun game, and I do recommend it :)

663,"There are huge caveats with a recommendation of this game.

The gameplay when everything comes together is incredible. The feeling of clutching a round for your team, especially when you're with friends, is beaten only by the elation of winning a close-fought match through sheer doggedness and team spirit. Frankly, in those kinds of matches even losing 16-14 can leave you with a smile on your face.

However, I don't know how I would get into this game as a beginner nowadays. Though if I didn't know better I'd probably try the free-to-play version, I recommend at least paying for a Prime-enabled account. The problem with cheaters is very large and could lead to a quick disillusionment with the game. Some veterans even leave the game because of this problem. It's such a terrible sinking feeling when you arrive in a match and see an enemy, or even a teammate, spinbotting or obviously hacking. You just know you've wasted the next 15 minutes or, if they only start hacking after they get angry and falsely believe you're hacking, you've wasted even longer. Either that or you can leave, but you will get a cooldown from matchmaking servers for abandoning a match! 

If you are intent on learning it competitively, I'd suggest researching third-party services like faceit (available for anyone as far as I know) or ECL (I believe currently only hosting servers located in Europe). ECL actively moderates its users and seems to have a fairly welcoming community, perhaps it would be relatively easy to find people of a similar skill level willing to help out a beginner. Unfortunately I think the base experience in Valve's own matchmaking system can be horrible and beginners might have a decent experience, or a completely off-putting one with toxic teammates who can't remember what it was like to be new in the game.

Prepare for the worst. I hope you get to enjoy the best of what CS has to offer.",True

All these are of course now animated, comparative to the simplicity of  ""The Secret of Monkey Island™"". All in all, a great game and tons of fun.

669,"Growth is an important factor in Global Offensive, especially if you're coming into Counter-Strike fresh or after a sabbatical. This is an extremely hardcore, skill-based first-person shooter, and it forces you to think differently than other modern shooters. If you’re a Call of Duty player, you’re going to need to change your play style to succeed here. Counter-Strike also tries developing into something new here as well, despite doing little to push itself beyond what it’s always done best. Global Offensive modifies old maps to keep veterans on their toes, and introduces official new modes that encourage different play styles for the first time in almost 15 years. For the uninitiated, Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is a small-scale, team-based first-person shooter with permanent death. When a counter-terrorist kills a terrorist planting explosives in a classic Defusal match, or a CT escort swallows a sniper round in Hostage Rescue, the victim is dead for good and doesn't respawn until the next round. As such, players on both sides must exercise skill and care. The bomb objective, meanwhile, gives everyone a purpose. Of course matches end when everyone on a team is dead, but a clever and coordinated terrorist team will give the CTs the slip, plant their bomb, and protect the bomb site. Between rounds, everyone spends earned cash on better gear and guns, and the cycle continues.",True

674,"Years of playing overrated AAA shooting games with lens flares, blood on the corners of your vision, and blue everything have since taken me away from the good old primative day of filling in the shoes of generic swat teams fighting generic terrorists; of which both groups lack the ability to look down the sights of all but a few weapons. 

Then I found Counter-Strike: Global Offensive. 

Being set eight years after the events of the previous game, there are noticeable changes brought upon by the passage of time. For example, the cognitive ability of hostages have further decreased to the point where they can't walk on their own. Moreover, both the terrorists and counter-terrorists adpoted new-found language ability. Finally, as we've evolved from the black and white days to being able to see the world in color, the world of Source has evolved drasticly in it's graphics in the eight-year gap between games.

Among the new things introduced are atom-wide ledges, birds of superavian strength, and a modernized Russian train station which pays tribute to the skillful, fun to play with, and polite players of the Motherland.

Finally, Counter Strike: Global Offensive has gone above and beyond the expectations of being an emergant AAA title by introducing an economy system that teaches rich naive kids the harshness of the post-2008 economy. Bravo.

[h1]Update Dec 2018[/h1]
The fact that they added the [u]Battle Royal[/u], a mode that is now [i]fashionable[/i], and changing the game in a free to play, make it clear that Counter Strike was [u]losing popularity[/u] and they want to save the salvable. [i]As happened years ago with Team Fortress 2.[/i]


[h1]Update Dec 2019[/h1]
Since last year, the [b]cheaters[/b] activity is now double or more.
Literally can't play more the game. Happening something like {30 kills, 100% hs} or {45 kills 9 death} or {5 v 1 and still lose} or {when you are winning, also 14-1, enemies in the second half become PRO ESL player} or {you win one or two, then, in the other matches you gain automatically noob rage players} or {more you lose and more the next match will be hard, can't work like that}

[i]Just play for have fun, don't care about ranks. Nowday who are high rank is just cheating.[/i]


[h1]Update Jul 2020[/h1]
Cheaters became smarts, they toggle just when they need (not about the complete match, but about rounds. Example: they toggle when they are in eco and turn off when YOU are in eco. Something like that.
Recently our Lord Gaben and developers team push out a new unexpected update: If you run ""weird"" software in background while you play this game, you will be warning. If you ignore the warning and keep doing so, you will go play with people with low ""trust factor"". Can be a good (small) fix. Let's hope! See you again in the 2021.
Btw, after 5 years i'm still LEM... damn i'm so noob XD


[h1]Update Jul 2020 Second Edition[/h1]
The Trust Factor update is a complete flop! XD
You can search online, everyone say that. Reddit, newspaper about videogames... now the cheaters activity is increased. Literally ANY match you can find one or more of them, in enemy team but also in your team. In this state is totally unplayable.
Maybe because of the warning message that dosen't appear in most case, then people think that thier cheats are safe, so they keep use them more frequently.
Valve want to stop cheating, but they help them to cheat more... ahaha incredible!

This year is the worse in terms of cheaters, literally any match have spinbots. I remember old times when overwatch cases was so hard to understand if they cheat or not, but now, every overwatch case i see there are 2 o 3 spinbots XD amazing!
But hey, finally Valve come to help (a bit) us, the stupid players that still enjoy the game without cheats and they did this: [url=https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/730/view/3059613232566173082]Non-Prime status accounts will no longer earn XP, Ranks, Skill Groups, item drops, or Prime status through play time.

720,"There is no mixed recommendation so i think a positive review would be appropriate here, ill try to sum up the experience in a short.

CS GO is a game about endurance, either you quit it or try playing it in a very hazardous environment. What im trying to say here is that in this game you can find people from all walks of life, hell i can do a social study with all different people ive met so far. The core player base consists of guys in their mid 20's who either act like they know everything (they know s*h*i*t) and mock you most of the games, or guys that swear to you in very different languages e.g Russian, German... 

Next are all the kids who had a relationship with my mother that i didn't knew before and they end up spamming in the mic the whole game. The next group are all the people that wasted all their parents money for virtual skins and show off hence ruining the game itself and making a lot of good people leaving the game for good. The next group and probably the one most responsible for ruining the game are the cheaters/hackers who buy hacks every month to ruin other people's experience in the game. Either you have luck to not end up with cheaters most of the daily games or you do, thats a concept of you win some or you lose some. Other group to mention are the smurf accounts, the people with ranks way higher than yours to either make your life easier or harder depending if they end up in your team or not. Those are people that wanted attention but didn't get at the first place so they end up being wiseguys to the rest of us at the lower ranks.

When you get in a competitive match there has to be a person that gets kicked for no reason, another that ends up teamkilling you the hard way, or someone yelling you for playing good and bad. Your self-esteem would be ruined by the end of the match. Though i should mention that the game is more fun and better by playing with friends. But if you are a lone wolf every match is a story in its own, like a box of chocolates. You never know what you're gonna get. Sometimes you will get reasonable people with you sometimes you will hate yourself for playing the game.

The mechanics are okay to me atleast, you still need skill in this game to perform good. Sometimes you will do good K/D/A and lose the match and sometimes you will end up getting zero kills most of the match and win. Making your progress on ranking up nearly impossible.

I can go on about the bad things and the good things about this game which the bad ones outweigh the good ones but ill still recommend the game if you are a particular kind of person who wants to fight his way in a very troublesome community. With the hope that Valve can fix many of the issues that bother this undoubtedly good game.",True

722,"This game is a lot of fun. I've met a ton of solid ass people, and forged some pretty dope friendships through playing CS:GO together. Non-Prime matchmaking is def a pain, hackers and toxic bros dwell there more often than Prime lobbies, but they can usually be persuaded to play nice, and 9/10 times a lobby will vote to kick a hacker almost immediately. All in all, an extremely positive experience in my life.

If you decide to buy this game here's 10 Tips: 
1) Your ears are your eyes. 
2) Echo = Eco
3) AVP = AWP
4) Top left you have radar. Learn to use it.
5) The guns have rubber barrels so when you hold the trigger for more than 3 shots, the bullets will go all over the screen.
6) P90 was crafted by Gods so it's users are not hackers.
7) If you have the bomb, sit behind your team like a good dog.
8) The game's secret name is Counter-Strike: Dust 2.
9) Competitive is the main game mode but there are other modes for your little kids too!
10) If you easily get brain cancer just from losing one match STAY AWAY FROM COMPETITIVE! you psycho!

A game recommended for players with ""First Person Shooter"" experience

[h1]Pros[/h1]

+ Game Mechanics is not like other games
    + Different weapons with a totally different weapon recoil
    + Running and gunning with rifles don't work that well
    + No aim down sight on most weapons (sorry Call of Duty and Battlefield fans)
    + No prone (again sorry Call of Duty and Battlefield fans)
        + in result, difficulty in simplicity
+ Needs a lot of skill and variety of play styles
+ Competitive
+ Always room to improve
+ Team game (communication and strategies)
+ Fun with friends
+ A huge variety of different weapons to choose from
+ A huge variety of fun workshop maps

[h1]Cons[/h1]

- Hard for new players
    - Smurfs (people that are way more experienced teamed against inexperienced players)
    - Variety of maps, and game modes to learn 
              - Call outs: names of parts of the map to learn
              - A lot of map knowledge required
- Frames Per Second drops, uncommon. (Lag)
- Hackers (Cheaters) => [They eventually get banned, loss won't count against you]
- Community can get annoying or frustrating at times (uncommon 0-2/20 players per game)
- Limited of servers, Europe plays with Russians that cannot speak English.
- Maps tend to be CT sided. (slightly)

735,"Counter Strike Global Offensive in itself is a good game. We are getting frequent updates from the dev’s and the player count keeps increase. 

Rather than writing a lengthy summary of my opinions of the game I have decided to break it down into two groups of bullet points. 


**The Good**


* High skill ceiling but easy to start FPS 
* Lots of fun to play with friends / make new friends 
* Many of the guns are viable unlike previous versions
* Dev’s connect with the community and gradually make tweaks and ingame changes after deliberation. 


**Needs Improvment**

* Visibility (HDR / Bloom are locked down unlike prior versions). 
* Upgraded anti cheat (too many hackers in higher elo MM). 
* Movement and accuracy modifications.
* Some guns need further tweaking (Deagle / P90) 
* Valve servers need lower VAR / higher tickrate 
* 


**Overall Rating **

Too much hatred and very less understanding community (almost all) to the point, that they hate hackers so much that they start hacking to get back at them, and get VAC banned, and then starts writing a review HERE against hackers...???? what???? Are you kidding me???  Lacking emoticons!!!  O.o  ^_^

Correct yourself and make the community better!  Yes, I do recommend this.  You cannot stop hackers unless you can change the attitude!

You are talking about bad community..?  We are the community ******!

How to change ourselves:  To begin with..  Unfriend your hacker friend first and block him even if he just hacked once.  That is just the start and we have miles to go now!  Good Luck!

740,"Best competetive ""guess where hitbox is"", ""99 in 16 hits"" and crate opening simulator for true MLG players. You have beautiful classic 10x10 metres square maps to test your tactical genius, truely realistic feeling of shooting with airsoft weapons with stunning purple camo and banana stickers on them. 
  Will i eco or will i buy after lost pistol round? It doesn't matter because at ""master guardian elite"" level and below your teammates will buy and die anyway and there's nothing you can do about it, since they're speaking on horrific Lovecraftian languages. Good thing skill levels make a difference and ELO works in team games, right? You just have to reach Global Elite or train your real life friends in special camps for 5 years to have competent teams and enjoyable rounds.
  You can play on Dust 2, Mirage or Cache, because search for other maps takes forever, which is good because these  legitimate tournament maps don't reward people for ""suka krisa"" gameplay.
  Weapon spray act just like it should: it works in preprogrammed pattern so you must remember spray of every weapon if you want to kill shit, because if you just sit with ak and shot static target right in the head, you might actually miss! It aint 1.6 anymore, scrub! It works kinda like japaneze Touhou games: you play for 100 hours to remember every pattern and then you're good to go to play on shitty competetive servers where hitboxes travel in outer space and none of it actually matters.
  Anti-cheat system works like a charm! People can just buy csgo gift for 1 dollar at some web service, other guys can exchange it for a crate that drops every now and then, play 10 games with wh and aim and get up to ""distinguished master guardian"" just in 4 hours or less. Then you will be delighted to play against them as they rush middle at dust 2 making 5 headshots as fast as rmb can be pressed. But no worries! Since VAC doesn't work properly, developers added Community Overwatch where you can spent up to 10 minutes looking at some guy running at light speeds with negev spinning like a yoyo killing everything! Without even slightest reward or weapon skins you like so much you can do developers' job at cleaning off the cheaters!

768,"The ""third"" game in the critically acclaimed First Person Shooter series that have shaped the PC gaming industry for years. Originally a mod for Half-Life turned into a stand-alone, had a Soruce sequel, and now Global Offensive. Counter-Strike 1.6 has long been one of the most played steam titles, seeing as the entire Steam platform was created with Counter-Strike in mind. Today Global Offensive have actually surpassed the original game in player base, something that Counter-Strike: Source failed to achieve.

I was never a hardcore Counter-Strike fan, I always had a buddy or two that were better than me. Therefore I can't tell you the perspective from a experienced CS player. A lot of players were disappointed in Counter-Strike: Source because it did change too much of the core mechanics. Others were disappointed that the game did not change enough. Global Offensive apparently somehwhat succeeded in both those things in some mysterious way. Some core 1.6 players like it, and the game is relatively friendly and easy for newcomers. Of course there are still players who disagre and still value 1.6 or even CSS better.

Counter-Strike Global Offensive offers the same team based versus mode, where you spawn, buy items, and you are free to move around the map to find the enemy players. The maps are never too big, and you always spawn in the same area. The main objective is to kill all enemy opponents, but there's also the classic objective of planting the bomb, or saving the hostages - depending on the map. Once you die, you have to wait for the round to finish before you respawn. Classic maps such as de_dust and cs_office have found their ways into this title as well. Same goes for most of the classic weapons, AWP, M4A4, AK-47 etc.

Beside the classic competetive team vs team, there's Arms Race and Demolition. Arms Race is a adoption of the classic ""Gun Game"" game mode from the original Counter-Strike, where the players are in a team deathmatch, and each kill will level up your weapon to the better. Demolition is a cross between Arms Race and classic ""plant the bomb""-objective just on smaller maps. There are also time-specific events such as Operation Payback and Bravo, where players must buy a pass to play on community made maps and to support the creators.

Just like any other modern Valve title, this game comes with all the Steam features including Steam Workshop, where people can share their created weapon skins and maps. Just like Dota 2, the items does not change the gameplay in any way, only cosmetic stuff. There is also weapon drops in game that players can get, with different range of rarities - To bring the Team Fortress 2 lootfest to this game as well.

[b]Pick this game up if you are looking for a competetive, as well as casual, multiplayer-only first-person shooter. There is plenty of room yet to learn this game, even if it seems hard at first.[/b]",True
769,Excellent team tactical shooter. The 5vs5 Competitive Matchmaking is the best part and can deliver hours of fun with your friends.,True
770,"Simply the cake of first-person shooters. In my head CS is the purest aim-based shooter. 

The Counter-Strike series are an absolute classic dating back 12 years and the recipe hasn't changed very much. Why change what is not broken, and Valve realized that and made CS: Global Offensive a modernized and community-driven version of older holy grails like CS 1.6 and CS:Source.

I just had to buy this game for the sake of the good old LAN-party days and the lasting effect CS 1.6 left on me.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

I am very pleased with what Valve managed to do with this game. I never knew it was possible but they managed to make the game compatible with all skill levels, as opposed to something like let's say CS 1.6 in which ""Get rekt"" is the only game mode new players can play.

What surprised me even more is the fact that they kept the classic feeling of older titles in this series. All you have to do is go into the game options and change your crosshair to ""Classic"" and you're set.

As I expected from Valve's legendarily well-made engines, the game is running as smooth as butter on ice. The input scheme is astonishingly sharp and for good reason, since every single pixel can make the difference here.

Speaking about pixels, the graphics are based on the Half-Life 2 engine and I must say, they're extremely fitting and the very, very well-made maps are the cherry on top. Nothing distracting here and definitely nothing ugly or out of place. It's a minimalist approach in my opinion and I absolutely love it! No extra filler added in, only what's needed. As a result the game is optimized as hell for high frames per second. Flawless gem polish all-around, can't really spot any imperfections.

CS:GO is really balanced around the player's skill level, the player's aim and his team synergy. Match making is solid, too. There is really to complain about in this game. If you are losing it's because you suck and if you win it's because you are a mean, well-oiled clicking machine. 

I haven't really delved too deep into the team aspect of this game but I am really looking forward to the new ""Competitive"" matches. I will get there eventually, I just need to get even better than I am now, and maybe make some time to play more awesome games like this. Competition is not absent from this game, it's over-abundant for those who want to seek a challenge. You'll get it, for sure.

The game modes are plenty as the maps. They include the classic Terrorists -- Counter-Terrorists paradigm and they revolve around the classic: Plant the bomb, Rescue the Hostages and many more new ones that are just a truck full of fun. More casual and more well-known game modes like Deathmatch and such are in the game if you want to shoot something fast.

I am really surprised by the numerous and awesome community this game constructed, and it's constantly growing too. The players are really friendly and fun to play against from what I've seen. Good sportsmanship too.

All in all, what it really comes down to is the fun aspect of this game, and boy, I must say after just a couple of matches I realized I was gonna skip the night just to play some good old CS. The game is fun and addictive once you get into it. Rounds may be short, but the replayability is ridiculously good, and it scales well with the multiplayer aspect. Man those headshots are satisfying to land.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

Some tips I gave to a friend, and I'm sure these will be useful for newer players out there:

""In CS, basically you have to click on the enemies head before they do, while your crosshair is minimized. Don't shoot unless you have a guaranteed headshot.

For starters, I recommend switchingto one of the dynamic crosshairs in the option menu.I use classic dynamic. Now you have an idea where bullets are going. Try shooting bullets at a wall and see where they hit. Try full auto, try burst. Try practice mode here, without bots.

In 98% of the situations it's good to burst or semi shoot. Never go full auto, controlling recoil is essential. You must wait a bit until your crosshair is small before shooting. Don''t forget to use Crouch/Walk (Ctrl/Shift) to minimize your crosshair. For beginners, try crouching when you see a guy and try clicking on his head. Also, never shoot while moving, your rekoil is huge and you don't have chances to hit.

Don't forget to put your crosshair at head level always. Keep it up and close to corners. When enemy comes by you only have to move an inch for a headshot.

Play deathmatch at first to train.

What matters, in order:
1) Aim
All weapons are hitscan. Aim well and use low sensitivity + a huge mouse pad. I go 28 cms per 360 degrees.

2) Reflexes
You have to aim accurately and you also have to be fast in doing so. No point being able to click on the enemies head if he clicks on yours first.

3) Map awareness and predictive thinking
This is basically your game skill that you've gathered through experience. Knowing how to be effective on the map. Knowing where enemies are. Listening for enemies. Knowing to take cover. Knowing when to engage. Knowing to stay with teammates. Knowing where to throw grenades.""

-------------------------------------------------------------------

Overall, this game is absolutely great. Can't really point anything wrong with it and I'm really looking forward to spend hundreds of hours on this one in the long run.

Maybe I'll uncover some things wrong with it after I play it more, and I'll surely update this guide.

Buy it.

Especially if:
-it's on sale
-you like FPS's, especially if you've played and loved the classic ones like CS 1.6, Quake and such
-you have good aim
-you like a challenge and you have a competitive nature

My son got this game for Christmas in 2021 from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories.",True

800,"You play for 3000+ hours, have the worst luck, get the worst team mates, watch every single game at the major but still dont get a drop even though your friends get 3, lose all your skins gambling etc, etc, ETC.

Then, you start cheating on a different game; GTA for example. You realize how ridiculously easy it is, and love the feel of aimlock. You think- 'Hmm, why haven't I tried this before?'. So you download free cheats onto a memory stick, boot the cheats up, remove the memory stick and use the cheat on a retake server.

It's instantly so much more fun than you could have ever imagined and you get a bit carried away so you are banned from the server. You realize if you keep doing this you will lose your account very quickly so you say to yourself 'I'll only cheat when they're cheating'. This idea quickly vanishes as you get more and more tilted after every death and realize that you don't actually have to go through this. 'Just toggle on, its literally a click away' a little voice in your head says. So you learn how to cheat subtly and soon you can't actually play well without cheats.

Then one day your friend says he knows someone who makes his own private cheat. He then sends you the .exe over Discord, you stick it on your USB and delete the public cheat. You're now basically invincible.

810,"This game has become a great FPS in my library. I played a CS mod many, many years ago (Tactical Ops: Assualt on Terror) and loved it always wanted to play it online but never could at that time. I finally bought Global Offensive and I've been impressed everything I was expecting and much more. It's a simple FPS with different modes search and destroy, hostange rescue, TDM, and more.

I will give you the warning, it's very difacult to be good at this game. The level of compitition is great. I honestly can go into a game and suck and have fun or light up the scores and still have fun. I typically play just competitive matches where it's a 30 round game first team to 16 round wins wins the match. It varies by map as to which game mode you play and in each round you only get one life. Sounds hard right? Exactly! Competitive is a blast. I highly recomend this game if you like FPS and like playing online. Use stradegy, play with friends, play with strangers and remember DO NOT PLAY THIS WITHOUT HEADPHONES IF IN PUBLIC PLACE!

812,"When I reviewed Counter-Strike Source a few years ago, I called it things like ""immortal"" and ""the definitive multiplayer FPS.""

The Awp is easily one of the most satisfying weapons in gaming. Quickscoping and noscoping can be a gamble - I really like the balance and precise feel of the Awp.  The rest of the weapons feel really good - there is much more variety here: we are talking custom weapon skins and even a custom loadout for each team.  This is one of the areas where CS:GO shines, and leaves its predecessors in the dark ages.

Competitive matchmaking is one of the really nice features of Global Offensive.  The game allows you to play in competitive matches based on your skill level rating. This is done similar to the matchmaking in Dota 2.  While not perfect, I find the matchmaking to be pretty accurate - it is rarely a cakewalk.

Always be wary of the player community for this game - this community has some sick and twisted people, tons of trolls, smack talkers, hack accusers, mic spammers, and cry babies, lol.  Fortunately you can mute players, and if you are so inclined, can vote them off the game - nice!

Trading and items drops are a fairly big part of the game as well. One of the neat things about the game is you can easily sell back your in game drops via Steam market and basically play this game for free or even profit from it. its insane, but some items sell for legitimate currency.

CS:GO is on the rise reaching peaks near 500,000 players.  There are huge tournaments played, and with each passing month the game sees positive growth.  I think its safe to say this is the new ""definitive multiplayer FPS""!

813,"The IWI Negev (also known as the Negev NG-5) is a 5.56×45mm NATO light machine gun developed by Israel Weapon Industries (IWI), formerly Israel Military Industries Ltd. (IMI).

In 2012, IWI introduced the Negev NG-7 7.62×51mm NATO general-purpose machine gun and is used by the Israel Defense Forces (mainly in the infantry, combat engineer and special forces units). The NG stands for Next Generation.
The Negev is a gas-operated selective fire light machine gun that uses propellant gases from the barrel to cycle a short-stroke gas piston operating system under the barrel and a rotary bolt locking mechanism. The bolt itself features 4 radial locking lugs that engage the barrel extension and its rotation is controlled by a pin on the bolt body, which rides inside a camming guide machined into the bolt carrier. The bolt contains a spring-powered casing extractor unit, while a lever ejector is housed inside the receiver (it is rotated by the recoiling bolt carrier).

The design was meant to be reliable, especially in adverse conditions. In 1997, it was officially adopted by the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF).

Many people like to complain about bad randoms or too many hackers (or smurfs where everyone is a cheater kills one, makes sense) - I can only agree with that to a certain extent.
CS:GO is a team game and therefore you need good teamplay / a team, so please queue with a few friends or stop being toxic like a pig and make friends with your random teammates, that's also possible!
Since I have most of the time a green trust (drops from time to time on yellow because of too much writing in the chat, apparently Valve does not filter that therefore you are simply muted after X chat abuse reports and downgraded to yellow trust, perfect system Volvo) so I hardly get cheaters and also rarely Smurfs in my game.
Finally, I can recommend CS:GO to everyone, if you lose too many games or no longer have fun helps a break - or just play with Premades ;).

Тэгэхээр ийм байна. Тоглоомын эхэнд чи алан хядагчид эсвэл тусгайгийн цагдаа нар гэсэн хоёр багийн аль нэгэнд нь автоматаар хуваарилагдах болно. Хэрэв чамайг аз дайрвал, багт чинь 1 ширхэг орос тааралдана. Харин эсрэг тохиолдолд, 2-3 оростой нэг багт учирна гэж мэд! За тэгээд ... террористуудын гол даалгавар нь тун энгийн : тэсрэх бөмбөгөө замдаа гээлгүйхэн шиг авч явсаар 'Шороо Хоёр' гэдэг газарт модон texture-тай чулуун хайрцагнуудыг, харин 'Там' гэдэг газарт усан оргилуур доторх загаснуудыг дэлбэлж алах ёстой байгаа юм. Харин цагдаа нарын гол зорилго нь цаг дуусахаас өмнө очиж тэр бөмбөгийг нь салгаад хайрцагнуудыг, бас загаснуудыг аврахад оршино. Түүнчлэн, 'Албан Газар', 'Довтолгоо' зэрэг газруудад арай өөр дүрэм үйлчилдэг. Ердөө л шар өнгийн унтлагын хувцастай залуусыг чи А эсвэл B цэгүүдээс эсрэг багийнхандаа харагдалгүй нууцаар үүрч явсаар өөрсдийнхөө төрдөг дээрээ авчраад, шар зураасны ард гаргахад л гүйцээ! Тэгээд л чи ялах болно! Олзны хүмүүс ч аврагдах нь тэр! Браво! 

Бас чамд муу тоглох эрх байхгүй. Хэрвээ муу тоглоод эхлэх юм бол багийнхан чинь чамайг урагшгүй нөхөр, олхиогүй амьтан зэргээр чинь дуудах болно. Харин тэдэнтэй сөрж хэрэлдэх гэвэл төрсөн эхийгээ элдвээр дуудуулаад дуусна шүү! Тэгээд чамайг ичих ч үгүй багаасаа хөөхөөр санал хурааж эхлэхийг нь яана! Гэхдээ, арай соёлтой нэг нь чамайг айлын өргөмөл жаал, аль эсвэл торхноос олдсон бутач хүүхэд зэргээр нэрлэх байх л даа. Өө бас муу тоглох ёсгүй шигээ сайн тоглож бас болохгүй шүү. Хэрвээ чамайг сайн тоглоод эхэлбэл эсрэг багийнхан чинь чамайг хууран мэхлэгч, залилагчаар чинь дуудаж эхэлнэ. Бас тэдэнтэй хэрэлдэх гэвэл мөн л ээжийнхээ талаарх чихэнд чимэггүй нууцуудыг олж мэднэ. Тэгээд дараагаар нь тэд чамайг залилагч байна гэсэн шийдвэр дээрээ бат гэгч нь зогсоод ЦОРГо компани руу мэдэгдэл явуулна шүү хэмээн сүрдүүлж эхэлнэ. Хамгийн сүүлд амьд үлдээд дайснаа дарж, дархан цолоо мандууллаа ч гэсэн багийнхныхаа хүссэн өнөөх сүрхий AWP бууг нь газраас олж авч чадахгүй бол мөн л тэдэнд зэмлүүлж, харалган новшоороо цоллуулах болно :/

840,"This is an extremely hardcore, skill-based first-person shooter, and it forces you to think differently than other modern shooters. If you’re a Call of Duty player, you’re going to need to change your play style to succeed here.Global Offensive is definitely a Counter-Strike sequel -- it looks and feels familiar, with minor tweaks here and there to help balance old issues and surprise longtime players. This is a demanding, skill-based multiplayer game that's as satisfying now as it ever was, but it's for a specific kind of player. If you're not willing to learn to play different than you're used to, look elsewhere. Otherwise, this is a top-tier tactics game that will probably share the long-tailed legacy of its predecessors....",True
841,"Counter Strike: Global Offensive is just a few bug fixes and features away from beating its predecessors. With 100s of hours on this game and previous installments, it is safe to say that CS GO is just as good as providing a competitive and fun experience as 1.6 and source did. One thing I love about the Counter Strike shooter genre at once is the sheer amount of skill required, you cant simply jump into a kill a wreck havoc, you must be able to learn spray patterns, smoke areas, and have a good amount of game sense, in most games the map doesn't make much of a difference towards the gameplay. But Counter Strike: Global Offensive provides a substantial amount of game sense, map knowledge, and gun spray patterns in order to just get the simplest of objective done. The ranks add more gameplay and less repetitive, not only is it fun to say ""IM Master Guardian 2"" but its also a good way to separate different skill groups. Ranging from the Beginning of Silver to all the way to Global Elite. 

One incredible feature that is new to Counter Strike is the addition of Workshop. You are able to download maps, gamemodes and also post skin ideas! Awesome way to add value and replay ability to the game! The map balance is a bit screwed up on a few maps, but with a good team you can achieve anything. However not every game is perfect, especially Counter Strike, unfortunately valve really decided to start off with new micro-dlcs. With the recent CSGO Betting scandals. Valves reputation has went lower then it should be. However there is a way to get these micro-dlcs without paying. You can get pretty **** drops when you rank up. The recent addition of spray cans is the worst of the worst. I hate seeing them in my drops as they have no value at all and could have been in the game since the beginning, worst way to charge players. 

The verdict is Counter Strike: Global Offensive is just as fun as it was in the past, with new features to give it better replay ability, I think this game shines out to be one of the most played and competitive and fun video games even after 4 years; And that's not easy to say, especially for shooters. The cons can be easily ignored, as they dont provide any substantial benefit in the game, and are just cosmetics. Overall I give CSGO a 8. Its fun and amazing with the exception of Micro-DLC. 

Pros: 

Upgraded Graphics 
Fun Competitive Scene 
New Features

I loaded up de_nuke and started to put the chickens out of their misery. I cried harder that night than I have ever before. 

The next morning, with tears in my eyes, I loaded up Counter-Strike: Global Chicken, and I saw a new item waiting in my inventory. My Flip Knife had turned into a Flip Knife Slaughter. At that moment, I realized what a horrible thing I had done.

This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So I decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died.

3. defusing a planted bomb (ct win)
4. bomb explodes (t win)

- servers are much smaller with only 16 players, which differs compared to the 100 players of other battle royale games like Fortnite.


[h1]My opinion on new free to play update:[/h1]
why would any hacker waste money on buying csgo when they can play it for free?

remember that non prime (free to play) and prime (paid users) dont mix.

so by making the game f2p: it separates legitimate users (people who are willing to pay money for the game), with hackers (people would rather save them selves a bit of money and play the free version, as there is no need for them to waste money getting prime).

so yes there will be a lot more hackers in free version, but you won't have to deal with them if you yourself are prime.

in my opinion this is one of the best moves valve could of made. and i understand there thinking as to why they did it.",True

894,"The basic concept of competive Counter-Strike match has changed very little in the past 17 years:  5 terrorists and 5 counter-terrorists fight each other in order to detonate/defuse bomb or eliminate  entire enemy team to win. Same old story but everything is polished to a perfection. You usually find a competive match within a minute and game is ready to start usually within 5 minutes. When playing other game modes a game is usually ready for you almost instantly.

CS:GO servers are really stable and I have never experienced a server or game crash. If one players happens to quit/drop/crash player is automatically replaced by a computer controlled bot. This is a great improvement as one or even two players quiting no longer means 100% sure lost.

There are multiple gaming modes available and while most people play just competive I strongly suggest atleast trying Arms race and demoliton modes. They offer far more easy going, less stressful and quicker game sessions.

Counter-strike has always been all about teamplay. Playing competive is almost pointless without a microphone which is the best way to discuss with other teammates. Typing with keyboard is not good enough because gameplay is so fast-paced. You get most out of this game when you are playing with friends. Most of the CS:GO community seems to be younglings and that means there will be a lot of swearing, bullying, insulting and bad sense of humor. Pretty much in every single game with strangers.

I have played Counter-Strike since 1999 and playing CS has never been as easy & smooth as it is today with CS:GO. Easy to learn for people new to fps games and hard to master even for fps veterans.

[HISTORY LESSON] Just to point out how easy competive match making is made in CS:go, I tell you how you found a competive match in early 2000's: First you had to gather 5 friends to play (sometimes you had to wait like an hour before you could find all the players, because everyone had to be part of the same clan/team,  you couldn't play with strangers). After that you had to go to a specific IRC chat channel to find your opponents (5 mins if you had a server of your own, up to an hour if you didn't). Then you confirmed the match with your opponents at Clanbase (A site that keep track with clans/teams wins and losses). Finally everything was set for all players to manually connect the game server. Use console command to start recording your gameplay (in order to proof after the game that you are were not cheating) and start playing. After the match upload your gameplay records to clanbase and pray that your opponents are kind enough to confirm the correct game score as soon as possbile in order to receive points from winning.

I muted them all as soon as they just started giving each other shit in a shouting match at the start of round 2. When I unmuted at 14-4 they were all best fucking buddies. Giving each other calls, ""nice shot guy!"", ""well played guys"" and all that.[/code]

Gameplay:The Game mechanics are in my opinion pretty simple yet extremely effective.Aiming feels almost flawless, no weapons are overpowered if you have enough experience.Game isnt really trying to be realistic. Its more of a skillset shooter (Spraypatterns, prefire common spots, when to use each weapon, economy and blah blah blah 1 taps)CS:GO has multiple mods and community servers which shows this isnt a comp. oriented shooter.

Multiplayer:Sadly there is the problem. As we all know VAC isnt the smartest anti-cheat system which means you will play against some fishy players (Wh, Aim, 2000$ gaming chair). Only way to really get past this problem is my using ESEA or another 3rd party client (Never used sadly) which needs a monthly fee probably. Other than that the game is pretty fun.

The Community is pretty Toxic as it is in almost every Competitive Multiplayer game.There are obviously some mature players but not everyone is.1 good aspect is that you can learn to swear in 81 different languages. (malaka, cy ka bly at, kur wa, ich fick deine mutter, youre g ay, blo ody bas tard, kardashian) some examples.

250 Grams of Butter
4 Eggs (your team)
100 grams of your own tears (salted)
1 tbsp of Salt
Another tbsp of Salt
More salt??
A cup of salt (salted)
You know what?
Just add the entire fucking shaker in there
Dried ocean water (just the salt)
Blood of a sacrificial lamb
Papa Smurf's hat

1) Draw your pentagram on the ground, using the Lamb's blood.
2) Chant you prayers to Gabe
3) You only need to preheat the oven to 10 degrees because everyone is already baked as fuck
4) Enjoy your cake! Why is it blue you ask? Why that's because it's the only thing Gabe will give you! Blues!

955,"So I've owned this game for a while now, and at first I wasn't going to write a review for it. However, I have recently joined an awesome 1v1 community server that has been so kind to me, so I though I'd incorporate that experience into my review.

When people think about the game, Counter Strike: the Global Offensive, they think about player experience. It is a strictly multiplayer game after all... People often refer to a certain toxicity in the general player base in CS, but I would like to shout out this 1v1 server. This server is a server that I have played on, and it is awesome. I have on multiple occasions, opened up about my familial past, and my son, Kurt (light of my life). It often gets shot down by haters or trolls or the like, but on this 1v1 server, I have received so much love... It has honestly been honestly so heart warming...

It has gotten to the point where most of the familiar faces on the server renounce when I join the lobby, even asking how my son, Kurt, did in school the previous day. I have also disposed the fact that my wife and I have split up after 15 and a half years of happy marriage, and my friends on the server have been nothing but supportive of me. 

A typical session usually goes talking about my son, Kurt, the owl my backyard, or World War II documentaries, and it is such a loving time. One of my most recent feats in the server is making it generally a more healthy, kinder place. I have made it a point to say ""GG"" after every round, to the point that more ""evil"" players will shout obscenities, saying that you don't have to say ""GG"" after every round, but that never gets me down. Ever.

Anyways, this is getting pretty lengthy, so I'd like to leave this on a high note. I want to shout out this 1v1 server, however I don't remember the name of it. If you do in fact find the certain one I am writing about now, please, reach out and say hello to me (and often my son, Kurt, will be in the same room as me, so you can say hi to him as well)! I have found a new love for the shooting genre of computer games, and I plan on sharing many, many more heart-felt moments with my friends and the ones I meet on the way. 

Thank you Valve for making this all possible.",True
956,"Update:

Suggestions:
- Big Update: Overwatch2.0:
=> Overwatch Reviewer can send one gotv demo manually to the system once every 24 hours and as long the ban rate of their send-ins is high they can still do it. This would crush cheating
=> Overwatch sases shouldn't show Skins anymore to make it as objective as possible
=> There shouldn't be a waiting time anymore between Overwatch cases
=> Overwatch shouldn't be done with the demo system, but in the main menu with streamed videos. This would remove the loading time, waiting time, it would be easier to skip back and fourth for personal needs to see a situation again etc.
=> A statement of valve that skipping cases til the end is allowed when you're sure he cheated
=> In case this data isn't necessary: Remove all 3 major cheating parts and put it together to one: ""Cheating"". This in general is enough and would increase the ban rate by a lot since the investigator doesn't have to review the whole case just to find out if a waller+aimbotter used a bhop script or anti aim for ""external assistance"" and some point.

- Separation of unranked prime and non prime: No prime player currently wants to play unranked because the amount of cheater is too high.

- No overwatch in non prime matches: Most of the current cases in overwatch are fresh made throw away accs playing in non prime. There is no reason to ban them. They will just create a new acc in 2 seconds.

- Removing the rank in dangerzone OR adding overwatch for dangerzone - both will prevent cheating a bit.

- Prime2.0 -> Whoever verifies his profile with a personal ID will get it. Verifying multiple accounts is possible, but all will have the same rank to avoid smurfs. Also if one acc gets banned, all current and future accs with that person ID will get autobanned. The ESL is doing this succesful since 2005
German source:
https://play.eslgaming.com/news/133942/Die-ESL-Playercard/

- Matchmaking Seasons: Every 6 months a new season should start. Player will receive a coin each season with the highest reached rank they've received in that season. Ranks don't reset entirely in a new season, but drop like this:
* Any Silver player will drop to Silver 1
* Any Gold Nova player will drop to Gold Nova 1
* Any MG-DMG player will drop to MG1
* Any LE-Global player will drop to LE

- Nerf the deagle base damage so 2 hit kills in the body aren't possible anymore. At the same time decrease the damage dropoff so the damage is the same on mid- to high range.

- Remove the spread of sniper weapons and inaccuracy when just scoping in

- Fix the OBS issue. Valve destroyed usual streaming just because they can't deal with possible cheater.

- Valve should work together with Youtube, Twitch and any other Streamingplatform to manually ban cheater on their Steam- and Social-Account

- Individual buy menu: People should be able to manually set their buy menu for their needs including sets of things they want to buy. Most people for example don't buy a m249 ever. Many buy the same sort of stuff all the time.",True

965,"Since the dawn of time, I have lost hope in fps games and life itself generally because of milked franchises. The sky had no color, food had no flavor. After playing this truly amazing life-altering of a game, I can honestly say I'm a changed man.  CS GO has captured my imagination and took me into my unknown sub-conscious.  This game has made a profound impact to me. Never before I felt like ripping another human beings head off. Uninstalling, reinstalling became a daily routine for the millionth time because of clueless teammates and their ""cool skins"" (I guess skin > skill matters more).

I feel like everyone needs to play this game at least acouple of times because the thrill of clutching, fragging, etc is unlike anything I've experienced. It takes me back to the good old CoD4/ Gears of War/ Battlefield days, having clan battles either GB or underground rules blah blah blah. A true fps that is fun for all ages! For the casual players, you can just have fun with mods and for the competitive, you will def enjoy this. From the ""your mom"" 12yr old squeakers to the maturest people. This community is toxic as you'd expect, but from the smurf and hackers, you'll either quit or keep on trying.",True

969,"This is a really good, casual yet uncasual multi-player FPS that pits two teams against one another. The Terrorists and the counter-terrorists (counter strikers). The terrorists need to make it to specific bomb drop points and hold the position until the bomb goes off. The counter-strikers need to kill the terrorists need to disarm the bomb if it is set or if they kill a terrorist holding the bomb before it is set, they need to make sure no one picks up the bomb to set it. If all members of one faction die, they lose the round. There is no respawn until the next round. All rounds take place on the current map. You don't go to a different map until the match ends.

Since you play a few rounds per game (let's say 15 rounds), you get cash for each round win or lose and you can spend that cash at the start of each round on weapons and stuff. So the game increases as you go from just pistols and knives in the first round to much bigger guns in the later rounds. You can also pick up a weapon off the ground and use it as well (unless you've set the rules to restrict such things). You'll keep the weapon from round to round until you die. Its a nice system.

It is a great game dynamic with good maps that have the right amount of side paths and choke points to cover. The maps are small enough where there will always be some sort of action happening, but large enough where the action can happen at places you aren't.

There is no single player campaign, but you can play maps on your own with bots that have difficulty levels. You can even jump into a bot if you die since there is no respawn until the next round. You'll notice the easy bots take their time to shoot you as well as you can tell watching them they intentionally don't aim directly at you. This is PERFECT FOR BEGINNERS to pick up and play, but of course the bots get more difficult.

The game makes headshots instant kills and goes more along the realism path where if you jump and shoot, you're less accurate. When you kneel and shoot you're more accurate.

It's a fun game that fills a different niche than Team Fortress 2. Give it a try over a free weekend and its also dirt cheap.",True

984,"Well hi and thanks for stopping by.

After over 1000 hours of gameplay and reaching the LEM rank i consider myself expierenced player of CS:GO.
If you are thinking about buying this game, you might find this review helpfull.
What to start with... ? Surely if you are looking for highly competetive game, this is for you. You can compete with other players, and unlike in for example MOBA games, winning 1v5 is always an option. Beacouse this is the game where your personal skill matters.
But thats not the most important thing. This game teaches you teamwork, of course if you are Scream's son you can just solo win every round, but its not the goal of the game. If you solo que in competetive, you will be put in a random game with 4 random people on your team, and 5 random people in the enemy team. They can be different nationaliy, have different characters and react to things differently. But for the time of the game, 4 of your teammates are you best friends. You are supposed to watch their back, coordinate tactics to execute best situations for winning a round and communicate as much as possible.
Of course you can have a bad day, and meet 4 people that will not speak your language, will have a bad day as well and will try to grief you and loose the game on purpose. But thats just a rare percentage of my personal experience. You need to always stay positive and calm, and so will your team do.

When it comes to game mechanics. CS:GO isnt very complicated, but its very original compared to other FPS games. You are aiming your crosshair at a guy, holding that left mouse button like there is no tomorrow, but you are still not hitting ? Try chilling out a bit and just tapping that mouse. Dont run when you shoot, stop, aim up, fire. Its the way to go in CS. You will get frustrated a lot, you will curse, throw your screen out of your window, but dont worry: When you master the game, there is no better feeling than headshoting an awper with a deagle, trust me.

I mentioned a deagle... but there is a high variety of weapons in this game. Pistoles different for certain situations. Shotguns, SMGs, Rifles. You can even have your own Light Machine Gun ! But choose the negev, since m249 is worthless. Always felt MLG quickscope power in your veins ? Buy an AWP and the power of one shot kill (Unless you hit in the legs). Or if you are poor, just buy yourself a SSG08 and go for those tasty headshots. But to be completely honest, gun you will need to master at the first place will be AK47. If you managed to learn the spray pattern, the long range potential and the power of one shot headshot (To compare, no other rifle has that power... well except the negev and the deagle, but those are not guns you will mainly play) you should be good to go to play competetive.

Competetive ? But are there any other game modes ? Yes of course. You have very old and popular arms race, where everyone shoot each other to level up the guns and in the end kill someone with a golden knife. You get the demolition. Something like competetive, but you are not allowed to buy guns, you level them up instead every round, if you get a kill. We have a deatchmatch where you can practice and warm up (And I reccomend starting the game with this), you also get the most famous :Casual. Full of unranked, new players, sometimes bored globals, but mostly people playing cs:go for fun, not for rank.
Are there any other gamemodes ? This seems boring. Of course there are plenty of community servers allowing you to play Battle Royale, Deathruns, Bhop servers, Surfs, Hide n Seek, Zombie modes and A LOT other cool stuff that myself havent managed to discover yet.
But wait, if the game seems that cool, there must be a catch to this. And yes there is. If you dont know russian... oh poor soul, wish you luck, since you will be yelled at a lot. You can also meet cheaters, obvious ones that just spinbot around killing you through 10 walls to boost the rank of some noob paying for it, or you can meet trying to boost themselfes with a slight aim assistance or bhop scripts, but its barely noticable. I rarely meet cheaters, and regulary fulfill my duty as part of the Overwatch.
Overwatch ? What is this ? Its a system implemented in the game allowing you as a player to watch a demo of a game, where somebody got reported. And the person that got reported is the POV you will see. Its completely anonymus, but also helps catching people that somehow avoid the VAC system. But dont think you will get access to it easily, takes some time.

Last thing i wanted to mention are... skins. And holy shit this like csgo has its own economy. For money you buy keys, for keys you trade skins, for skins you get skins. Since if you have skins, you must be a pro player, right ? Thats silly, but some of the skins used in game cost over 10k $ and its not a joke. You can loose money opening cases, you can get yourself this kinky knife skin you always wanted. But dont get addicted to it, since me myself spent way more money on the skins than I wanted.

1005,"After putting a decent amount of time into this game I have come to find that is all in all an enjoyable game to play(especially so with friends). As far as playing games go I have always liked playing competitive fps' as I find they are fun to learn and it is satisfying to do well as much as it is fun to win in ranked. The skill threshold for this game is sufficiently high while you can still play it casually and enjoy it if you don't mind getting destroyed by the occasional smurf every now and then. if you want to improve however this is the easiest way to do so.

-Learn recoils for different weapons.(workshop maps are amazing for this)
-Learn nades( pop flashes, smoke and molly lineups etc)
-Up to preference but as I'm still learning all the maps I stick to one or two maps when I play before switching  to another once I'm confident on that map and can remember smokes and where to play.
-Watch pro league watching better people play can help you learn how to play.
-Youtube videos on how to play are good but I mainly just recommend watching them for nade lineups and good positions to play.
-As good as trying to play like a pro like stewie2k sounds just make sure to remember what works for pros might not necessarily work for you as you probably don't have the game knowledge or aim that they have i.e. as cool as being like the smoke criminal may sound rushing through t smoke when you're ct probably isn't the greatest idea.(unless you have REALLY good aim in which case who knows it might work out for you.)

1011,"Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, is probably the most balanced Fps game in all existence. 
I personally started playing Counter Strike when Source had been out for 2-3 years or so. I've always enjoyed the close quarters strategic combat, and the fact that the game is all skill.
The're are no unlockables, the only things you can ""earn"" by playing are stats, and skins. A pro player will have no statistic advantage over a gamer that's new to the series, other than his skill.

+Great Engine
+Great Servers
+Balanced Gameplay
+Smooth Gameplay
+Excellently constructed maps
+Stays true to the franchise
+Cheap

-No unlockables (except skins)
-InGame purchases with real money

Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is the best competition style First person shooter Valve has ever made so far. Theres nothing else to the game than multiplayer (and the braindead bots). This is a must have for all PC gamers. If you dont already have the game, pick it up now, or get it on the christmas sale, in a couple of weeks.

1017,"After Surpassing 4.000 hours on this game, I can [b] Finally [/b] say that this game is...The [b] Best Competitive FPS [/b] I have ever played...

I realise that at this point everyone already know what is CS:GO, this game have become one, if not the most popular competitive game in the world... But here in this review, I’ll talk about my personal view about the main aspects of the game, after experiencing it for a long time and getting really involved in it, a game that made me meet a lot of people and even join Teams.

[u] [b] The Positives: [/b] [/u]
[list]

    [*] [b] Mechanics [/b] – This game have the Cleanest and most Satisfactory mechanics, from Movement to Shooting. It's fairly easy to know how it works, but is very hard to master and get used to it, that’s what makes it a truly competitive game, having so many levels of complexity. Source It’s been out there for ages and is not even close to be outdated.
    [*] [b] Map Design [/b] – Overwhelming and Memorable designs they are unique, interesting to learn and different to get better on each one of them, some maps are improvements of older CS’s and still have a lot relevance
    [*] [b] Skill Game [/b] – It’s a game that the more you practice, the more you want to get better, even after 4.000 hours I can still improve my impact on the game, and when I reach that performance it’s an amazing feeling.
    [*] [b] Competitive Scenario [/b] – Probably the largest e-sports out there, with the most grown scenario… Cheer with friends and go out on events or tournaments all over the world it’s a really positive thing to the health and long life of the game, it’s also supported by Valve itself.
    [*] [b] Friendly for Casual players [/b] – There a lot of different modes and workshop maps that can make the game entertaining for casual people, the community provides a lot for the game with Workshop content! I think they could improve the experience for new players, there is no tutorial to help people that need it.
    [*] [b] Skins [/b] – Best designed skins for a game, most of FPS cannot give such quality for single skin like CS:GO can, it’s really enjoyable to have them in your inventory, making yourself a collection, and selling or trading them anytime you want.
[/list]

[u] [b] The Negatives: [/b] [/u]
[list]

    [*] [b] Variety [/b] – It’s not very common of Valve to release new Stuff, it’s been a while since the last operation and a new game mode release. They are changing the meta, but it takes a long time for these updates also… So, the game can become repetitive for a lot of people.
    [*] [b] 128 Tick-rate [/b] – I think everyone agrees that Matchmaking should be played in 128 tick-servers, that makes the game more fluid and smooth,  but it’s not been announced or planned to be a feature anytime soon, so if you want to experience that, you have a lot of 3rd parties platforms that provides that with a lot of other interesting features!
    [*] [b] Toxicity [/b] – People in Lobby sometimes can be really toxic to one another; we can sadly see it around from time to time.
    [*] [b] Cheating [/b] – I think that’s my main problem with CS:GO at the moment, even though I don’t think it got any worse with it being Free… The real problem is Premium cheaters, the ones that use high profile cheats and trusted accounts to mess with MM experience, they know how to use it properly and probably will not get banned. So, if you start to think a lot about it, you’ll probably go crazy and lose faith on the system they provide against Cheating. Valve has been updating their Anti-Cheat with different methods, but it's a long process.
[/list]

I’ve been really enjoying this game for a long time, I love to dedicate myself and get better, training my aim, movement and knowledge about the game. Its even more fun when played with friends, trying to make yourself a team to play in tournaments or grind on Matchmaking. It’s really hard not to recommend at this point, the game have a beautiful Legacy and is now [b] Free-to-Play [/b], definitely worth trying it out. But be careful, you might get addicted…

1020,"pretty great game

mmmm",True
1021,"Game is overall a great game depending on many factors, which i will go over in this review. To start with this isn't a game you can just jump into and be #1, it takes a lot of practice, time and commitment. Overall i've played this game for 2,400+ hours combined between my multiple accounts. I have personally loved this game for what it has to offer and have always been a fan of the game-mode and the genre of the game.

I will be going over the positives and negatives in this review as well as summing it up at the end with my overall thoughts and opinions. I will admit this game isn't for the light hearted, as the community is a fairly toxic but also pleasant community. I have made many friends but also dealt with a lot of childish players within this game. You will be able to make friends quite easily and play with them constantly making it easier to rank up as your playing with people you can communicate with rather then random people.

There are a few key points to this game that make it amazing those are, team work, communication, skill, knowledge and memory. Team work is a vital part of this game and is what makes it amazing, it's a lot harder to win when you aren't playing as a team, any great team requires great communication, communication is an important part, as well as knowing what to call and when to call it. This game requires some skill, at the higher levels a lot more skill. This doesn't necessarily mean you need to be the best, as there are ranks in competitive for a reason to assign you to people in similar ranks, although there are smurfs and cheaters as with any competitive game. Knowledge and memory go together, can't have one without the other in this game, you need to be knowledgeable in how to peek, where to peek, how to peek together and more similar situations, to top it off you also need good memory in where to smoke, how to smoke certain positions, as well as flashbangs and other utilities.

In saying that, that is mainly only the competitive side of this game, there are many other amazing features offered in this game, those being community servers, arms races, demolition, casual and other gamemodes. This game has a lot to offer, in particular one of my favourite parts of this game is the community servers, you have surf servers, and game servers, making it a game for everyone.

If you are feeling like taking your gaming to the next level i would highly recommend this game, there are many leagues to join i.e FaceIT and similar. There is also the pro scene which many make it to in different divisions, this allows for the best of the best to play for cash and other rewards.

This game has no real pay to win features besides when the game requires you to now pay for prime, which is totally worth it! There are skins, but those do not have any advantage besides player models which can make it harder to see the person which is playing.

Now i will give you all a lovely bullet point list of what this has to offer quickly ran down with negatives and positives below:

The Negatives:
1) The Community - This will be featured in both areas, as it is a downfall and a positive, the community can be quite toxic but also quite welcoming.
2) Learning Curve - There is a learning curve for this game, so don't expect to jump in and be rambo.
3) The Cheaters - This comes with any game, but in this game there is a chance you will run into cheaters quite frequently.

The Positives:
1) Amazing Game - This game is always going to be a top game and very popular at that.
2) Requires Co-operation - This game i personally enjoy for the fact it requires the team to work as a team.
3) Fun Combat - The guns have recoil patterns to learn, getting a good one tap is quite fun. Overall combat is a great aspect of this game.
4) Top Selling Game - This game is a top selling game for a reason, allowing all sorts of players from all over to play an amazing FPS.

Thats the good and bad quickly summed up, i will be updating this review as time goes on. I hope you all enjoyed and if you have any questions feel free to leave them below and I will get to you as soon as i can. If you are looking for a game to have some fun then this is the game for you, aslong as you know what your in for. Hope you all have a lovely day and keep on fragging!",True

1025,"Counter-Strike: Global Offensive maintains much of what made the original Counter-Strike (and Counter-Strike: Source) so fantastic, while adding a couple of new game modes, both of which were based on user-made mods to the original game. 

Counter-Strike continues to enjoy the enthralling gameplay and near-perfect balancing that took it from a cult hit in college dorm rooms to one of the seminal games in the multiplayer first-person shooter genre. 


In case you're unfamiliar, Counter-Strike is an entirely multiplayer experience. You can play offline against AI bots, but these are still merely simulating what it's like to play online, rather than really giving you a single-player game. 

The good news is that this is as good as online team-based shooters get. In the traditional game mode, there are two types of matches and two tiers of play. 
Casual level is for newer players and removes aspects like friendly fire and the need to purchase armor and ancillary items each round (more on that in a second). Ranked level is the original style of CS, with all the ""realism"" settings enabled, but it also features a comprehensive skill-based ranking system to try to balance teams and place good players with other good players. 

CS:GO adds plenty, tweaks a little, and keeps the best parts of the classic multiplayer FPS. If you're into shooters, team-based gameplay, or just classic games that are updated well, you won't do better at the moment than CS:GO.",True

+ Plenty of well designed maps
+ Visually very appealing
+ Very high player population with great matchmaking that will get you in a game in less than a minute at any time of the day.
+ The Arms Race or ""Gun Game"" mode is a favorite of mine. Essentially every time you get a kill you upgrade to a new weapon which is a lot of fun.
+ Nice selection of guns
+ Great Sound Effects

~  A bit too competitive. People take this game extremely seriously and spend hundreds if not thousands of hours memorizing the map and perfecting their aim. Some might love this, others may hate this aspect. 

- You die extremely fast in this game, and can not regain health.
- Very repetitive. There isn't many game modes, and you mainly end up playing Bomb Defusal (which is basically Search & Destroy if you are more familiar with Call of Duty)
- Microtransactions ""Skins"" which are very costly
- I feel like Counter Strike lacks features that other shooters have. ADS (Aiming Down Site), Vehicles, Gametypes, Killstreaks, Leveling / Progression / Unlock systems, destructable environments, going prone, sliding, leaning, etc.
- In competitive play, a large portion of time is spent watching others play. After you die, you must wait for the round to finish by spectating others.

1053,"准备购买CSGO的同学要注意下面几点！
1：最好别碰箱子【这种比运气的东西就跟赌博一样，一开根本停不下来，除非你认为你自己是个欧洲人，不然最好别去碰箱子，安安心心的去买皮肤吧！】
2：升级经验是固定的，不管你是多少级，升级都是固定的5000点。每周升级都可以随机获得一个喷漆【有次数限制】或者一把皮肤枪，不过基本都不值钱，每周只能获得一次。40级满级后可以转生，回到1级，同时会送你一个今年的服役勋章，比如你17年满级转生，就送你17年的服役勋章，简单来说这勋章就是拿来好看的。
3：平衡性，不用我说了，皮肤没有任何属性加成，所以不用担心遇到什么人名币战士。
4：CT和T都有自己阵营的特色武器，比如CT的M4A1，T的AK47。【说这个就是想吐槽我有一个萌新朋友抓着我问为什么CT买不了AK47，T买不了M4A1。说实话我可以笑他一年，23333】
5：现在到了2级就能打竞技了，并且定级赛并不是让你定级打10把，而是让你赢10把，赢了10把才算定级完成。每赢2把会冻结你的竞技模式，无法打竞技，这是以你赢的两把的战绩还有之前输的几把比赛帮你测评你的水平，冻结时间结束后才能继续打竞技。定级完成后你才可以随心所欲的打竞技了！
6：一定要小心一些陌生人，有些心怀不轨的人会加你好友给你发链接，这个时候别去点链接，也别信那些人说的我用XXX元买你刀啊皮肤之类的，这些家伙们都不是什么好人。【提这个是因为在贴吧里不止一次看到有人被骗了。】
7：现在CSGO分两种服务器，国服和国际服，国服目前在18号前没有激活码是没法玩的，激活码自己去百度搜索CSGO完美官网去抢，国服和谐有点严重，血变成石油了，恐怖份子变成了****和谐符号等等。对于国际服玩家，VPN的话我比较建议网易UU和奇游。国际服玩家想转国服的话，跟DOTA2转国服一样，鼠标右键游戏点击属性，在属性页面选择【设置启动选项】，在启动选项中输入—perfectworld steam，确定，然后就可以玩国服了，不过国际服玩家没有激活码也是没办法在18号前进行匹配的。[10.2]这次CSGO更新后，好像打开游戏是让我们自行选择哪个服务器，可以选择国服也可以选择国际服，如果有什么遗漏的欢迎留言补充，这也是我最后一次更新评测了吧。
8:[8.5]最近V社在封中国饰品网机器人，导致中国玩家损失惨重，所以第八条建议，最好是等这次风波过后再用。还是那句话，理性消费才是关键。
最近混了混饰品交易网，饰品交易网主要还是看信誉，不清楚的萌新可以去问问百度贴吧的老哥们，饰品交易网最深的坑就是类似于赌博性质的“抽奖”，这抽奖很容易亏钱，相信有些氪金老哥很清楚的，交易网用来提现或者买枪都可以，但是我不建议去花钱“抽奖”，非常坑，真的非常坑。【7.30】因为某饰品交易网的事情搞得很多人被坑，因为我早就不玩饰品了，就不予评价，不过不是这次事件，某网的黑点也够多的，比如以前被串号转库存这些事情不少有，不过这次更新不说这个，这次我想教下萌新们安全地卖皮肤：去百度贴吧，饰品交易吧把你想要卖的饰品信息挂到贴吧里，跟别人谈价，等确定买家之后走饰品网，挂好饰品后把信息告诉买家，让他买。注意一点，这个是最重点的，无论什么情况，所有交易必须都是走饰品交易网，若他非要不用交易网和你进行交易的话，请不要跟他浪费时间，这种饰品交易不走交易网还会去市场？这种人不走交易网就是想坑走你的饰品，那种“买家”会要你去其他什么狗P网站交易，然后再申诉把钱拿回来，走饰品交易网至少不会被骗，目前由于某网出了这么大的事情，肯定有萌新在思考用什么交易网，因为我出了饰品坑所以也不好说哪些，但是我们有万能的百度贴吧老哥们，萌新可以去问CSGO吧的兄弟们什么交易网可靠，记得没错的话，好像置顶帖就有教的，然后饰品交易过程，最好是越短越好，所以要先找到买家再去挂饰品交易网，十几块的皮肤不需要用我这个，但是几百块以上的最好要先找到买家，再直接挂交易网，这次某网事件我就不说什么了，最后给各位萌新留一个提醒：饰品是个大坑，切勿沉迷饰品，别因为一时冲动，吃半月尘土。
9：国服出了后，为了少点萌新被骗，我给第6条补充一下，先说说目前骗子骗人的骗法吧，基本上想买你的刀或者找你打联赛的，全都是骗子。有人以前好奇，说为什么不能点链接，我就给你们讲讲吧，这是库存链接，对于绑了手机安全令牌的还好，没绑的绝对会出事，它会把你所有库存交易给对方，手机还好可以确认是否交易，但是没绑手机令牌的同学就惨了。然后别以为有手机安全令牌就可以随便浪了，有些黑客早已经弄了个盗号网站，等着你浪呢。目前骗子最喜欢用的手法是打联赛缺人来骗你，因为是机器人自动发话，我就给你们讲讲骗子一般怎么骗人的吧。
骗子：我们联赛缺一个人，你打什么位置？
萌新：？？？
骗子：行，我知道了，你加下我们领队，她会告诉你更多。XXXX【这是库存交易链接】

1056,"I have a very weird...love-hate relationship with CS:GO. To the point where I really don't know whether to put this game as Recommended or Not Recommended. It really took some deliberation to decide. Because it's honestly both. I both recommend and don't recommend CS:GO.

Let me take you through a very brief history lesson. I started in January 2014. I played up until August 2015 and then stopped. I didn't touch CS:GO for 3 years until June 2018. And since June 2018 - I've been more or less treating it as 1 of my 2 ""main games"". Of course, having learned from my original burnout after clocking 1200 hours - I've taken plenty of breaks from this game, even played on different accounts with lower ranks once playing at DMG/LE stopped being fun. Now that that's out of the way, let's get to why I both love and hate CS:GO at the same time.

[h1]Why I love CS:GO:[/h1]
There are a few reasons I love this game. One good place to start would be the satisfying and rewarding gameplay. CS:GO encourages you to practice and get good at a variety of things - weapon control, movement, positioning, strategy, leadership, critical thinking, improvisation - practicing these will lead to huge payouts in your gameplay as it's generally stuff that'll help you get better.
Another reason I love CS:GO is, honestly, sentimental value. The entire Counter-Strike series is one that's helped me feel a certain connection that's very close to home for me - family. I was introduced to Counter-Strike through my brother. And as the series progressed and we both got into CS:GO - our bond has grown. I genuinely feel like CS:GO helped me feel closer with my brother and helped us have a mutual understanding of each other - all because of a game series he got me into by playing Counter-Strike 1.3 all those years back!
On top of that, CS:GO has made me plenty of friends. Some of which I'm friends with even today - nearly 5-6 years later. From attempting (and failing) to run a CS:GO team to just messing around in Silver games on alt accounts - I've made my fair share of memories with the game. In a lot of ways - CS:GO has just been ""home"" for me.

[h1]Why I hate CS:GO:[/h1]
Of course not everything is sunshine and rainbows. I will get this out of the way right here right now - cheaters. They've always been a problem as far back as I can remember. Always. Fighting cheaters is a constant uphill battle. Valve are trying, but according to the community - they're not trying hard enough.
The community is another reason I hate CS:GO. Short and to the point - it's incredibly toxic. And the community just breeds more toxicity. It's really gotten to the point where I really can't tolerate [i]certain[/i] people anymore. And I become toxic myself. My friends who play(ed) CS:GO echo this statement too - some have even had to take extended breaks because trying to be a part of this community has taken a mental toll on them. It's enough to take a look at the General Discussions tab for this game to very clearly see what I mean regarding that.

I could talk about more with CS:GO. The economy, the pro scene, the good part of the community, the flawed Trust Factor system, etc. but I don't want to make this review that long. After all, you're clearly here to see whether you should give this game a go or not. And honestly...I don't think I can answer that. I have my reasons for playing this game all these years later, even if I hate the ever living poo out of it sometimes. But I also love this game and just can't leave it alone.

If you don't plan on partaking in the community and have high tolerance towards cheaters from having experience from other games that have it worse, then...maybe give it a shot? Who knows. It might just be your new ""home"". But if that's not your cup of tea - don't be afraid to just pass on CS:GO either.",True
1057,"Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is without a shadow of a doubt one of the greatest, if not the best FPS shooters ever made. It is an extension of the already legendary iterations such as Counter-Strike 1.6 and Counter-Strike: Source. 

Whilst there are a lot of issues with the game - always has been - e.g cheaters especially, the game is rising in popularity still to this day after almost 10 years, which speaks for itself really.

[h1]Pros:[/h1]
+ Great game to play with friends.
+ Balanced by competitive ranks.
+ Thousands of community server to play on.
+ Can make money from skins and operations.
+ Fun to watch eSports.

[h1]Cons:[/h1]
- Not well optimized, CPU intensive game.
- [strike]Dumped with hackers even in prime, now even in MG ranks.[/strike] [i] No more, the trust-factor feature actually works well. I haven't faced a cheater for a long time.[/i]
- New players will encounter cheaters as they will be non-prime when starting CSGO.
- Toxic community (make sure you have friends to play with in MM).
- Really bad anti-cheat. CS:GO has 10,000+ hacks available which are undetected.

EDIT: CS:GO is now free so basically if you have a non-prime account you'll most likely encounter cheaters. But I have a decent trust factor now and I hardly face any cheaters, hence I changed my review from negative to positive. FACEIT is also fun as they have a great anti-cheat.",True

1099,"It's hard to argue that this game is probably the best CS release since 1.6. Some will disagree, might argue Source is a better game and they will have their own valid points. In my opinion this game is a true sequel. It brings the fun and nostalgia from the earlier versions of CS, the same flowing game play that made it popular and the heavy emphasis on team game play. It mates the old with the new; the expectations that a FPS be somewhat realistic if not fun to play. It's a modern game; it looks and plays like modern games should but it all looks a bit familiar, like the hot girl from years past that you bump into 10 years later. 

CS:GO is more technical and team oriented than previous games in the series. Shooting, movement, sound and grenades are completely different and you have to master them once again. Weapons now have a purpose - there's a reason to buy the 5-7 and P250, as well as the MP5 replacement, MP7. Team play is just as important as the economy; once you lose it there's no coming back.

It's a demanding skills based that's as satisfying as any CS title has been. 

[b]Pros:[/b]
 - Updated maps, visuals & sounds
 - Emphasis on team play
 - Valve online matchmaking as well as valve casual servers
 - Extensive customisability & player drops
 - More realistic player and game behaviour
 - CS:GO workshop
 - Pro players
 - Active development and regular updates
 - Listens to community
 - Low-end modern PC requirements for top quality & top resolution

[b]Cons:[/b]
 - Gungame isn't the same as CS:S
 - Because of different skills & tactics, CS:S players will feel like it's a familiar but new game. Skills are transferrable one way, not so much the other; when you play CS:S after CS:GO it will feel and sound like you're playing underwater.
 - Sound still seems like an afterthought
 - You will need to upgrade your video card to something made in the last 3 years if you want something that's playable and looks good

[b]Ratings:[/b]
Graphics: 8.5/10, far improved on previous models but there's still room for improvement
Sound: 8/10, feels like an after-thought, if there's one complaint I have about the game it is that the sound quality and engine just isn't good enough
Gameplay: 9.5/10, excellent and extremely playable game with very high replayability
Overall: 8.5/10, it's a great game and could easily be 9.5 out of 10 with improved audio and slight improvements in visual quality. It's a modern twist on an old classic.

[i]Footnote:[/i]
I lost my way with CS after CS:S and I turned to a variety of other games. Battlefield 1942/2142/2/3, Tom Clancy Rainbow 6, America's Army 2/3/PG. Before then I was an avid player of CS and I would play up to 100 hours per month. When I played CS 10 years ago I always asked, why can't this game be a little more realistic? Why can't they stop people from shooting through 3 walls 20 metres apart and killing with me an awp? Why do grenades act like balloons and float through the air? I can't really emphasise how happy I am that a lot of what shouldn't happen has been removed and the overall quality of visuals, sound and game play has been improved.

1107,"So, after 1000 Hours of this game, I know pretty much all I need to know for a review. This game is amazing and all, but there are a couple flaws. I am currently MG1, and it was a long road to get there. I had the troubles, of when I got on a large win streak, I would be on a game I was certain I would rank up, then of course a hacker would have to be on the other team. All we could do was report them, and then get on with our lives. Then, after another long win streak, I was about to rank up when I got Derankers. Of course, all I could do was report them for griefing and move on with my life. Then, there is the factor of constantly versing smurfs. There is a small chance of winning when against a smurf, and it gets on my nerves when there is a whole team of smurfs against just a normal team of my rank. 

If you can get games with no smurfs, derankers or hackers, this game is amazing and I enjoy everything about it other than what was just mentioned.

However, seeing how much Valve has listened and continues to listen the community, and how quickly they make changes in both the short and long term, it has completely restored my faith in the game. Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is incredibly fun and feature-rich, with plenty to do for both casual and competitive players. On top of this, there is also plenty of ways to promote and support eSports, which is a much-needed and fundamental step in reinvigorating Counter-Strike in the competitive gaming scene. However, the most important thing with this game is that the community is incredibly nice and friendly - and with a game as difficult and intense as Counter-Strike, it's extremely welcoming. Good stuff!",True
1125,"there is no game out there that I got as much into as I got with cs:go. All started with me watching competative matches on warowl's channel. and I saw these elite players with their godlike skills and fancy new skins (the arms deal update came around). and I was like damn, I want to play like them. so I bought the game. I wasn't sucking bad because I'm a visual learner and learned most of the basics by watching the pros play. but I wanted more. I learned the spray patterns, shot a wall to learn the recoil over and over again and soon it came to the point where I surpassed all other players in casual matches with ease. the spray patterns where in my muscle memory, my reflexes with the awp improved, my nades landed where I wanted them to land and the addiction swallowed me whole. I'm going to break 1000 hours this week, I have a 300 euro inventory, a clan that get's better and better by day, a youtube channel and the best thing: endless fun. You can play gun games, awp servers, minigames, jails, hide and seeks, deathruns, aim servers, knife servers, surfs, deathmatches, demolition games and many more not considering casual and matchmaking games. And if you think you will get bored of the maps you're wrong. The maps don't create the gameplay experience, it's the players + every half a year there comes out a new operation with additional new community created maps and community created weapon skins. it costs 5 euros, but if your friend has the operation you can join his game anytime without being blocked by the game or forced to charge.

1138,"When I was 18 I was a stereotypical socially awkward nerd. 
I had really sh i t luck with women and I was afraid of each and every girl I came across. I was a virgin as well. I had only kissed a couple girls, not much other than that to be honest. My best friend, Liam, always got women. He always told me that talking to girls was easy and not scary at all, just don't be a scared little dog and do it. I always wished I had his confidence. I asked for help to get a girlfriend/someone to f u ck so I wouldn't be a virgin finally. He said he'd help me, I was so damn happy and scared at the same time.

So one day he decided to take me to a party he was going to. He was content on getting me laid finally. I was nervous asf. I had a few drinks and I saw a girl I thought was a solid 8/10. A little feral though. Liam saw me looking at her and laughed. I asked him what was funny and instead he pushed me into the same girl. I apologised and was freaking out. Liam came over and said ""This here is my boy, he acts shy but he's a ????ing god. Treat him right."" and took off elsewhere. The girl giggled and told me her name was Olivia. Even thought my autism kicked in and I was a complete idiot we hit it off. A guy she knew came over and told her to come have a smoke with him. She said yes as he grabbed her hand and started walking off. She asked me if I smoked, I have never but I said yes anyway cause I wasn't letting this dog take her away from me. I inhaled my first cigarette and naturally I had a coughing fit. They laughed but it was all good. 1 year after that party I was dating Olivia. She took my virginity and we hit it off. I started smoking more often because why not, life was good. I loved her more than I will anything. 

At least it was until Olivia dumped me. 
Olivia cheated on me with Liam. Multiple times. The love of my life and my best mate.
I became immensly depressed and started chain smoking. At least a pack a day. I did this for a solid 7 months. One day I started to feel a pain whenever I took a deep breath. I sha t myself. 
I went to to doctor's to find out what was happening. I was so damn worried. My doctor said they'd call me with results after a short time.
After a week my doctor called me up with some results. I was freaking the sh i t out at this point. He said I was all clear and lucky because my cells defended my body before cancer could take affect. I cried for 3 days out of relief.

It hurts to see that other games do something about they're cheaters and valve does so little for a game that leads the industry for well over 20 years now.I get it. anyone as an individual or company alike wants money. I just feel like valve can do a lot more to combate the cheating problem. Get that VACNET rolled out already, get HARDWARE BAN implemented. Yeah that would not be this many players but it would be a much more cleaner and involved comunity. Now.. for the sec point let's talk about graphics and the engine of the game. as i'm editing this review 3nd time already, cause the game changed over the years i can say that the greapics are really good. But the game needs to get that source 2 port that everyone talks about. simply beacuse it would make content for the game like maps skins and such much more easy to crate by not having to back port everything from source 2 to source 1.Valve keeps sayn' that a port wont change the game as much as we think but at the same time it opens the door to much more then that. I have a old PC from 2016 and this game still dosen't know how to use he's full hardware BEACUSE of the 2004 engine thats runing it. yeah they are parts of source 2 implemented into the game already like ""Panorama UI"" and such but thats still not enough, the game in its current state can't be called a modern game that can use your full hardware computer or optimise for your shitty laptop for that metter. So yah.. hopefully valve will finaly listen to the community and give this game the atention it needs. Valve please FIX.
good luck and play fair!",True
1146,"CS:GO mixes up Source and CS 1.6 gameplay.
The recoil and the flashbangs are more 1.6 like and the rest is pretty much Source.
In CS you have no aim-down-sights-feature what means that you have to control your fire by shooting short salves or single shots. You can also learn the gun's spraypatterns by holding down fire-key and noticing the bullet-impacts (on distance they aren't really noticable but on short to middle ranges it works pretty well). In long range firefights people mostly strafe left and right, shoot single shots and try to hit their opponents head (unrealistic.. but interessting and challenging). You can duck pretty fast but it has almost no effect on your precision. You will be slow and more vulnerable. Flanking is hard in this game, because there is no sprint and maps are designed to have clear, mostly open ways. You can hide in only very very few situations because mostly you have great visibility (It's a bit bad and sometimes irritating that you can not disable blood decals). Mostly the only cover you can get is behind corners or of course headglitch-positions. 
In this game you can not go phrone or lean around corners. I think leaning would be a nice addition but no.. this game is still remains classic.

Armor is more helpful than it was in Source. To me it feels like it's more important to land headshots. Because of that it's rather unlikely to get wallbang-kills. It's hard to spray, there is not much hit-slowdown and armor is very powerful.. and sometimes wallbanging feels a bit random.

The sound in this game is good. You mostly hear exactly when people run, shoot or jump. You can mostly locate loud players really precisely (unlike in most modern games, where you mostly have crazy boominess or randomized sound.. because of perks for example). Counter-Strike is mostly comprehensible.

Some maps got a really nice overhaul (dust2, dust1, aztec, office, militia, mirage).. Train and Cobble are very different compared to Source or 1.6. Personally I don't like them that much.. Inferno is very similar to the Source-version (they only changed some wall textures and made some minor changes). 
It's good that Valve changed the hostage rescue mode. Now it's more tactical and more objective based, but I think this mode doesn't work that good with the old map layouts.
It's sad that there are only very few new competetive maps. Instead of new official maps there are buyable community-mappacks which are available in competetive and causal matchmaking for a period of time.

The ability to find or buy weapon-skins is new in CS:GO. On the one hand it is cool to have camos on your guns, on the other hand it's bad that you mostly find bad looking and/or bad quality skins (or cases). Most camos look  very colourful and not realistic. If you want good looking skins you most likely end up buying the skins for real money (on the steam marketplace).

Conclusion:
CS:GO is a new CS with mediocore graphics (the textures are mostly 512x512 pixels and could be better, sometimes the bloom- and post-process-effects are a bit annoying and also some animations could be better), reworked maps, new recoil and still not perfectly balanced guns (but it's fine). It has most things that the old CS-games already had but also some new things. 
There is ranked matchmaking, a great HUD and an easy to use replay-function. It's also very nice that you still have dedicated servers. You have the possibility to make your own maps and use server-mods. These are all great features that every modern FPS game should have.
If you want to customize the look of your guns, you will have to pay for it. It's very very unlikely to find good skins and the amount of skin-drops is limited to 2-8 drops per week. 
All in all I think CS:GO is a game that continiues the series in a moderate way. It could be better but it could also be a lot worse. Since this game is not too expensive I can recommend you getting this game.",True

1160,"[h1] CS:GO review from a free account [/h1] 

Counter-strike: Global Offensive is a game in which two teams (One Terrorist, and the other Counter Terrorist) try to prevail against the other. The Terrorists try to plant the bomb at one of two sites or wipe out the other team, and the Counter terrorists try to stop the terrorists from accomplishing their tasks.

Pros:
Can be free to play (with limitations)- If you choose to play CS without upgrading your account, you can still play all of the game modes. It is actually pretty good for a free game. You cannot receive drops or a rank however. Steam cards are also not available to free accounts

Good multiplayer game- CS can be played with teams of 5 friends if you queue up in competitive mode. Cs also has the largest player base of any game on steam, so there are always people to play with.

Game is updated regularly- CS receives updates on the regular, and operations are added yearly (as of the date of this review)

Number of hackers lessened- In my experience, the number of hackers in this game has been greatly reduced over the years. I am playing on a new free to play account (an alt) to test this, and it does seem to hold up

Cons:
hacking is still prevalent in csgo

The ranking system is hard to understand- You may lose a game and de-rank, then go on to win 5 games with no rank up. You need to be patient with the ELO system

There are not many gamemodes- To be fair, they have been updating cs and introduced things like short comp matches


Overall, csgo is a fun game, and if you dont care about getting a rank, a free to play account works well for your needs. I initially played casual for the first 2 years of my csgo gameplay (back in 2015). If you dont care about comp and ranks, this is essentially what a free account can offer you. You can get into games, and even play competitive mode these days without it being ranked. It is a fun game, and I do recommend it :)",True
1161,"I must recommend this game, it is my duty as one who has spent 1600 hours on CSS (from xFire) and 500+ hours on CSGO. I played non-stop competitive CS:Source in regional championships, LANs, and online leagues; and won 4 regional championships with some LAN placings. Here's what I have to say about GO...

CSGO is awesome, Valve delivered here in the end. When it was released, yeah, it wasn't anything special, just a pretty CS:Source. But now we have amazing gun skins, stickers, awesome knives, intense major tournaments, souvenir packages, bracket prediction challenges, seasonal operations with extra maps and challenges for even more drops, etc.

It's awesome, it's a great game to be a part of.

Matchmaking and rated matchmaking based personal ELO rankings is a sweet way to keep competitive games close. It can never be perfect, but back in Source you had to wait in an IRC channel with a looped message playing until someone finally answered your loop and then it took them 20 minutes to get 5 in the server, etc. Basically with CS:Source whether you were trying to ring or you had your team it took between 20-60 minutes to get a scrim. Now it takes about 5. So, the fact that people still complain about it is beyond me.

Game play wise, each CS as I know them (1.6, Source, GO) has been different beasts in terms of mechanics and recoil control. Lots of little things that made or broke you as a player in these games, but recoil control is one of the biggest. You often hear people scream “deathmatch deathmatch deathmatch, that's the only way to get better”. Well, quick point, how can you DM to practice when you don't know what your practicing? Best thing to do to understand the recoil patterns is load an offline game, kick the bots, and shoot at walls. Seriously. Shoot and spray at walls with various guns at various ranges with various movement patterns, that's the best way to understand how to control and use various guns. You need to understand each guns grouping patterns first before you can practice controlling them!

About the community, yes, the flamers and trolls are alive and well. But here's the thing, I've been around CS a long time, I've won 4 regional championships with CS:Source, and really it never bothered me that sometimes the flamers are all you hear. Here's why. Once you play enough games (competitive or otherwise) you'll hear the same kind of person, it'll sound like this.. “you guys suck, why are you even playing this game?” or something similar if they are beating you. It sounds like this, “you're such a hacker, it's so obvious” when you beat them. The fact that people are so binary in their mentality amuses me personally, so I carry that over to CS flamers as well. Some people like to pretend they are perfect at the game, and everyone else around them is inferior, yet if you beat them you must be a hacker. It just sounds so stupid to even talk about it but seriously this is how a lot of people are about the game. Just don't let it get to you, there's no point. Don't even engage. And you wont have many problems.

It's not the easiest game to pick up right off the bat. “Spray at feet, get headshot” is a notorious saying from outsiders about CS games, because CS can be amazingly random sometimes. And the round-by-round economy, buying guns and items every round, and recoil patterns make it a steep learning curve. But if you understand the groupings (I said how to above), read guides about strategy (like economy management, game flow), and just get in there and start playing you will see why people just can't stop playing this game!

Counter-Strike was the world's original eSport. After the Championship Gaming Series went down the CS1.6 and CS:Source attention did as well, games like StarCraft and DOTA took to the forefront of competitive eSports soon after. But with the cases, skins, and major tournaments Valve and the CS community have turned CS:GO back into one of the world's premiere eSports and there's many, many reasons why it's succeeding. As I say, it's a very exciting game to be a part of right now.",True

What remains to say to the game still a lot was said ....
I write now my own comment and no Russian speaking I still cannot.
Would you like to get to know or meet Russians?
You like it to play a multiplayer 5 vs. 5 virtually to play alone.
You'll love it in a communication/ teamplay- game to speak to oneself, 
because no one else does.
It's fun when everyone does what he wants, 
all run in different directions without meaning and purpose.
You're also of the opinion that expensive pro-gamer headsets are unnecessary.
Who needs headphones or what to make announcements.
You're tired of being scolded by the French in Call of Duty.
You like to put more money in a game than necessary.
You like it when you buy expensive weapons skins which are later less worth.
You love to play a game for all eternity, But still not reach a new level as in other games.
You like to be scolded as a noob because you have 2 kills less than the one who insults you.
If you play a different weapon than all the others you are badly made.
Your love for Eastern countries increases thereby you will harder.
If you play alone then you meet strangers who can not speak your language or English.
You are kicked out of the game when your team players do not like you.
Your teammates are not always better than you, with the time you start Votekick like a Russian.
Unnecessary games where you do not meet trollers / hackers does not interest you.
So do not waste time with FaceIT and other things ..
You do not like beginner-friendly games because you are the PRO-Gamer.
The game is aimed at competition with teamplay, announcements and hearing
That is why it is so popular because it requires players, but not the pc.
Since I play the game, I always look exactly who is adding me.
In doubt, take no one suspect in your friendlist most want partial only your skins.
""I am Dimitri I send to you friendship request you accept!
And now lie down quietly on the floor, click on LINK and give me your CS: GO Skins.
Many thanks for your cooperation ""

You do not like long instructions and do not know what to do now.
Then it's time to dive into the nicest gaming community there is.
Did I say you can buy it?  I said you have to buy it!

CS: GO is like a greedy woman, but you love her forever until the end of time.
The feeling of hate and love connects and you can not change anything.
It's like roulette quite fun unless you play the Russian.

Was bleibt zu dem Spiel noch zu sagen viel wurde gesagt ....
Ich schreib mal meinen eigenen Kommentar und nein Russisch kann ich noch immer nicht.
Sie möchten gerne Russen kennenlernen?
Es gefällt ihnen ein Multiplayer 5 gegen 5 praktisch alleine zu spielen.
Sie lieben es in einem auf Kommunikation  Teamplay Basierenden Spiel 
mit sich selbst zu reden, weil es sonst niemand tut.
Es macht ihnen Spaß wenn jeder nur das tut was er will, 
alle in verschiedene Richtungen laufen ohne Sinn und Zweck.
Sie sind auch der Meinung das teuere Pro-Gamer Headsets unnötig sind.
Wer braucht denn schon überhaupt Kopfhörer oder wozu Ansagen machen.
Sie sind es leid in Call of Duty bloß von Franzosen beschimpft zu werden..
Es gefällt ihnen mehr Geld in ein Spiel zu stecken als notwendig wäre.
Es gefällt ihnen wenn sie teure Waffenskins kaufen der später weniger wert ist.
Sie lieben es ein Spiel bis in alle Ewigkeit zu spielen, 
aber trotzdem kein neues Level zu erreichen wie in anderen Games.
Sie stehen drauf als Noob beschimpft zu werden weil sie 2 Kills weniger haben als er.
Wenn  sie eine anderen Waffe spielen als alle anderen werden sie schlechtgemacht
Ihr Liebe zu  Östlichen Länder steigt dadurch werden sie härter.
Alleine spielt man mit Fremden die deine Sprache nicht können.
Sie werden aus dem Spiel gekickt wenn ihre Teammitspieler sie nicht mögen.
Ihre Teammates sind nicht immer besser als sie,
mit der Zeit startet man auch Votekick wie ein Russe.
Unnötige Spiele wo man auf Anständige nicht Troller/Hacker trifft interessiert sie nicht.
Deshalb keine Zeit mit FaceIT und anderen Dingen verschwenden….
Sie mögen keine Anfängerfreundliche Spiele den sie sind der PRO-Gamer.
Das Game ist auf Wettkampf ausgerichtet mit Teamplay, Ansagen und Gehör.
Genau darum ist es so beliebt weil es Spieler fordert, den PC aber nicht.
Seit ich spiele schaue ich auch immer genau wer mich addet.
Im Zweifelsfalle niemand Suspekten annehmen, die wollen teilweise nur deine Skins.
„Ich bins Dimitri ich dir schicken Freundschaftsanfrage du annehmen! 
Und jetzt ganz ruhig auf den Boden, klick auf LINK und geben mir deine CS: GO Skins... 
Viele Dank für Mitarbeit“

Sie mögen keine lange Anleitungen und wissen nicht was Sie nun machen sollen.
Dann wird es Zeit in die nettesten Gaming-Community einzutauchen die es gibt.

1166,"[h1]That's what happens when you take Counter-Strike's competitive playing to the next level[/h1]

As a long time Counter-Strike player, I couldn't just let [b]Counter-Strike: Global Offensive[/b] just slip by without playing it. As I always followed the evolution of the franchise, I did the same to the game and noticed some improvements as well as things that got worse.

Let's start talking about how happy I was when I found out that Valve is now paying great attention to the competitive community of the franchise. Before GO, you only had two options: host a server or play on a rented server you knew. There wasn't a ""quick game"" option like there is now, turning games much easier to be arranged. And it also works for competitive playing, as there is a whole new competitive mode which players may join to play like they were playing an official match, with official rules applied and no need of typing specific comands on the console as the game does everything for you automatically. Another thing I really appreciated is the guns market stablished for the game, shaking really good the community's market. I bought some games on Steam using only the money earned from selling some of those guns. Another good thing is that Valve also officialized fan game modes like Gungame.

However, the game hasn't changed much in relation to [i]Counter-Strike: Source[/i] when it comes to gameplay physics or even graphics and sounds. Some people even call GO ""CS: Source with skins"". And there have been some worsenings related to the guns, like the fact that some useless guns have been added to the game (the new shotgun and PP-19 Bizon are some examples) and others have been ""nerfed"" (yes, M4A1 and Desert Eagle, I'm looking at you).

In the end, [i]Global Offensive[/i] won't let you down if you're looking for a very nice first-person shooting game with an immense community to play with. If you like the [i]Counter-Strike[/i] franchise, you'll probably fall in love with this game.

Still not a 10, but we're getting there.

1169,"Basic Gameplay
You play as either a Counter-Terrorist or a Terrorist, both of which are deployed into a battlefield and each round are giving a small allowance to purchase weapons of their choice.
You can make extra money by winning rounds or you could also hold a knife up to the enemy demanding their money, Although that would be risky since the enemy would likely just to shoot you.

On the Terrorist team your goal is to plant and explosive near some uhhm.. important boxes?.
Anyway, once plant wait You patiently for it to explode.

As a Counter-terrorist you must eliminate all the Terrorist forces OR defuse the bomb, thus Protecting those ever important boxes from certain destruction.
Being a honourable opponent, Terrorists are sure to set the bomb timer just long enough to give the Ct's the chance to Slaughter the remaining T's, and defuse the bomb.

I'll list some positive/negative attributes of this game here.

Positive attributes :

- Matchmaking 
- Teaches children the harsh reality of gambling (although some never seem to learn even after $500 later)
- Ranks  
- Cool looking skins
- Fast growing population of players  
- Fat stacks of loot dropped somewhat often
- Chickens
- High replay value
- Deathmatch game type (I could go into more detail on negative parts of it, but that would make this review too long and boring)

Negative attributes :

Although I Do love the single player campaign, it could use some work. 
I REALLY wish it were longer.. 
And that final Boss fight is pretty lame. It only lasts around 27 seconds, and during that time the only way to lose is by taking offense from the old man that constantly insults you, and how his ""7 year old could beat you, blindfolded.""

- The game mode ""Infernal"" played on the map ""de_inferno""
Some people like this game mode however I personally dislike it, For those of you that have not yet had the chance to experience it I'll explain for you.
It seems like any normal de_ map However, The real goal is to scurry around finding any shred or scrap of rego, Normally it's hidden in obscurer unused sections of the map, and has the ability to shift/move around to different locations, Or even leave the game entirely for up to 10 minutes at a time.

- Demolition, Also known as ""jokemode"" Added purely as a joke that volvo was supposed to only unlock on every April fool's day, However some hacker probably that ""4_chan"" guy, permanently unlocked it. (Volvo have been working on a fix ever since)
Demolition is the game mode which automatically gives everyone amour and then requires you to get kills with weapons that do extremely poor damage against armoured opponents. Also no block is Enabled And Whoa?, So is team killing!


The volka Strategy

You could just play this game like a noob and spend hundreds of dollars on skins, OR 
you could play the game correctly like me. 

Here is my strategy :
-  Don't buy skins to start with, Seriously it's a waste of money.

-  Play for a good 50 hrs or so and sell any drop you get.

- Wait for a steam sale and Invest in as many copies of csgo you can.

- Work your way up to about 5 copies or so But make sure you don't get too many otherwise you won't have enough time to harvest all your csgo account drops (having more than 7 accounts may have diminishing returns) [Note- it takes about 20 hrs gameplay to activate the drops].

- Keep playing on all copies frequently to maximise drops.

- Once you have your economy built up with this method you can now buy skins with all that free income you have. Remember to Never gamble with opening cases. I've made about $100 with this method. I think it's about time to quit my day job.

1176,"Death is a great teacher. Failure in Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is, as it always has been for this series, the greatest way to learn where you should have gone, what you shouldn't have done, and how you could have done better. Counter-Strike players spend a lot of time learning -- consequently, they are always getting better.

Growth is an important factor in Global Offensive, especially if you're coming into Counter-Strike fresh or after a sabbatical. This is an extremely hardcore, skill-based first-person shooter, and it forces you to think differently than other modern shooters. If you’re a Call of Duty player, you’re going to need to change your play style to succeed here. Counter-Strike also tries developing into something new here as well, despite doing little to push itself beyond what it’s always done best. Global Offensive modifies old maps to keep veterans on their toes, and introduces official new modes that encourage different play styles for the first time in almost 15 years.

For the uninitiated, Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is a small-scale, team-based first-person shooter with permanent death. When a counter-terrorist kills a terrorist planting explosives in a classic Defusal match, or a CT escort swallows a sniper round in Hostage Rescue, the victim is dead for good and doesn't respawn until the next round. As such, players on both sides must exercise skill and care. The bomb objective, meanwhile, gives everyone a purpose. Of course matches end when everyone on a team is dead, but a clever and coordinated terrorist team will give the CTs the slip, plant their bomb, and protect the bomb site. Between rounds, everyone spends earned cash on better gear and guns, and the cycle continues.

Pieces of the Counter-Strike formula are dated at this point, but the superb heart and soul of Global Offensive is timeless. Teams are small, guns are lethal, and rounds are short. There's an addictive just-one-more-round quality to it, because there's a constant desire to do better than last time, to earn a satisfying kill, or to win in a new way. Call of Duty and Battlefield vets will wonder why they can't sprint to escape enemy fire or look down the iron sights to improve aim; Counter-Strike players will feel like they walked into their redecorated home. Certain map redesigns will catch hardcore fans off guard, but the changes are for the best -- the underpass choke point in de_dust, for instance, has a new escape route.

Even in the face of genre evolution, Global Offensive doesn’t care to adapt. CSGO is so dedicated to Counter-Strike's aging ideals despite market and trend changes that it brute-forces its way to success. Part of what makes it such an engaging competitive game is that killing in Global Offensive requires a wholly different skill set than other shooters. Everyone is limited to what they have and can see, with little room for character modification or on-the-fly advantages. Running and gunning is a useless play style, even if you've bought a helmet and kevlar that round, to the point that someone standing still is more likely to score the kill. Walking, crouching, or standing are your best bets to reduce the inaccurate spray of machine-gun fire.

Consequently, killing in Global Offensive feels good. There's a sickening sensation to dropping someone dead because you know they're not coming back. It's also satisfying knowing you used limited resources to play smarter than your victim. If players aren't watching corners, providing covering fire, or using smoke grenades and flashbangs, they're more likely to take a headshot from a more delicate and patient triggerman. The desire to experience that distinct feeling is a strong motivator to keep playing, even when you're getting steamrolled by an obviously better team.

If you've played Counter-Strike before, Global Offensive probably sounds a whole lot like Counter-Strike. Like Counter-Strike: Source before it, Global Offensive exists simply to modernize the look of the classic competitive shooter, while doing little to disrupt the core form and function. At the same time, it does enough to color outside the lines of tradition to justify your time and effort.

Fire is one of the most interesting new combat variables. Molotov cocktails and incendiary grenades either roast groups of guys or force them in another direction. Flames are a useful distraction or scare tactic, too. They're particularly useful during Demolition matches, which focus the fight at a single bomb site rather than giving terrorists two to pick between. The new and modified maps in this mode aren't as big as classic Counter-Strike arenas – entire sections have been cut off to direct teams toward a central location – but their thoughtful design is as intricate as ever. The Lake map is a standout -- there's a wide open yet densely populated yard around the bomb site, which is inside a sizable lakeside home with plenty of vantage points and hiding spots. To separate Demolition from Defusal, players can't buy between rounds. Instead, it takes a cue from the other new mode, Arms Race, in which each kill unlocks another weapon instantly. The better you do, the more you have to switch up the way you play, and because Demolition is so fast you'll need to be quick on your feet.

Unlike other game types, Arms Race allows for respawns. It's the most chaotic and care-free mode in Global Offensive, with players throwing caution to the wind for the sake of climbing the kill ladder as quickly as possible. It's a shame there are only two maps in Arms Race -- a problem that will more likely persist on consoles than PC.

If you have the option, playing the PC version is unquestionably the best way to experience Counter-Strike: Global Offensive. Mods, mouse and keyboard, and the usual PC-only options are better than the ports. Plus, Valve is much better about long-term PC support -- it abandoned Team Fortress 2 on consoles, and Portal 2's level editor was PC exclusive. If you prefer to play on consoles, Global Offensive is the same great game",True
1177,"CS:GO Review:

Counter-Strike: Global Offensive has set the standards for the most easy2play FPS-game. CS:GO has succesfully replaced the already popular Counter-Strike: Source and the developers behind GO has managed to rethink the game without leaving the ""Counter-Strike spirit"" behind. GO is, in my opinion, the most perfect Counter-Strike ever made, as it is the fusion of all the previous Counter-Strikes. In GO they have added skins, new weapons, new maps and a brand new gameplay experience where all the leaks from Source has been fixed.

Long story short. CS:GO is one of the best FPS-games ever made and I can do nothing but fully recommend this game to anyone who wants quick shooter-action with a simple gameplay.",True

1180,"Well, this game is amazing, and is very different from the past Counter Strikes. Graphics have improved alot, which I believe why many people love games because of their graphics. (Graphics aren't everything). As of the past Counter strikes, you would have to find a server with the particular gamemode that you want. (Arms race, Deathmatch etc etc) In CS-GO You wont have to worry about that, they have different gamemodes where you could actually choose to play in besides finding a server that has it. I have also notice that this is fairly alittle bit easier than any of the other counter strikes, probably since they reduce the recoil a bit? But either way, tap firing is always the key.

Also many Unique Features they have added in this game. First off, there are the skins. Many people disliked this idea since they probably thought CS-GO would be ""like"" Call Of Duty. Well, adding skins doesn't really mean anything, it just makes you be able to battle in style. Not to also mention offline mode. Offline mode is basically playing with bots. Now, some Counter-Strikes did have bots such as Counter Strike Source, but I just thought it was nice that they would add ""bots mode"" back. 

Counter Strike Global Offensive is way different from any other FPS (First Person Shooter). It's much harder and takes a bunch of skills seeing the fact that many players are already pros. So, that's why I play Offline mode. If I were to rate this game out of 10, I'll probably give it a 7.5/10.",True
1181,"This game clearly proves that Counter-Strike: Source is some Outdated Junk by now, and proves that the same formula that appeared in CS 1.6 back in the day is still enjoyable, if made properly, to this very day. Even though the movement and max sharpness of the mechanics has been dulled down QUITE a bit. I used to play CS:S just for target practice when idling for random reasons myself early 2013, but this game is complete enough to drag me into it. (4K h's by now) Even though again, i find there to be a lack of optimization considering how the game ran better in 2013/2014 (early), than today. 300+ fps VS today's 200-250FPS for reference.
The good old killing spree MOD from 1.6 Where you can spawn many times, which was about getting the most kills against the enemy team as a team, (A clusterfu*k without reason) and the classic zombie modes that has seen a return + a ton of other older mods from the past was/is missing though. With some returning slowly but surely however, GO is looking to become the best FPS game purchasable to this very date.

Thus, i recommend this game. Something i rarely do with anything. But even more so when you can get it 50% off when steam got sales!
By the way, you can get all your money and more back if you sell the stuff that drops in the game on the steam market. Which include sellings EVERYTHING. Or you can waste your money on another terrible gamble that will nver pay off because you got that extra money laying around from cases you sold in CS:GO, since when they drop related to events people pay super much for them and stuff...

10/10 (My old rating was 9/10) since you can eventually get your money back selling in-game items you get for free, stuff you can pay for is pushed frequently, spicing up the game if you wanna waste some money on skins, while the rest of the game is top notch compared to today's modern sub-par competition out there. The game is brutal and made for SKILLED play though, so go figure it is in general better made VS games like for example black ops 3.

1185,"Hello guys, I ussualy never do this but I must say a couple of words for this game

I never liked to play it a lot, cause shooting is terrible (in comparison to 1.6) but that's not the main reason that I am writting this down now, and I am not yet a pro here (just arrived at Gold Nova), but I am aiming to go even further beyond
But I still think it's good

Main reason are CHEATERS.. Yeah, nowadays You cannot play one proper match without having to report some people. I am prime user, and even then I see cheaters, so nobody is perfectly safe from them. I don't wan't to talk about f2p mode now, 99,99% of the matches are filled with some kids that think cheating is fun and cool, and that they are awesome because nobody can kill them... I am trying to help my friend escape low levels in order to play with more serious people (and hopefully without cheats) but it's no use...

Anyone else having this problems like I do? Any solutions in progress? Or is it this game destined to go down soon? :(",True

1194,"Note: This is a temporary review, I'm still pretty new to the game so I'll write another one when I invest/waste more hours on it

-My First Game

I remember it really well, because it was a game that summed up CSGO almost perfectly. Dust 2, a micspammer named ""Martin Shkreli"" playing MLP at earrape volume, 12 year olds on the mic and no strategy apart from ""Rush B"". I had no idea what I was doing, no idea about what weapons were good and bad and most importantly no idea how spray control functioned. Not surprisingly I went 1 and 13, or something like that.

-Gamemodes

Casual is more or less a big amount of players running around with no evident strategy apart from the goal to get a good KD ratio. 60% of the time Dust 2, 30% Mirage and 10% another map such as Cache or Cobblestone. However these maps you most likely will play in Competitive, so you can sharpen your ""skills"" and map knowledge here pretty easily.

Competitive can be amazing, and it can be terrible. It all depends on how good your team is, and how good the opposing team is.
I strongly recommend you play with at least one friend who is at a similar skill level to yourself so you don't get a team full of bogans/russians/idiots/whatever.

If I solo queue my team will look something like this (at it's worst, some solo queue games can be cool):

Me
American guy who calls strats but nobody listens
Angry Australian guy who yells through his mic when we lose
Another guy who never talks or communicates and has connection issues
Someone half decent at the game but gets irritated with his team OR a 12vie

Other team:

Uber Smurf
Someone terrible at the game but gets carried by good teamies
Someone in a party
Someone else in the same party who says ""ez"" every time they win a round
Anime Enthusiast who always runs AWP and Scout

Uh, I haven't actually tried out any other gamemodes like Arms Race and Deathmatch, but from YouTube they look pretty cool. 

-Weapons and Strategy, Silver Style.

Terrorists (assuming they win each round)
-Round One: Tec 9 Rush B Cyka Blyat Idi Nahui
-Round Two: Some SMG 
-Round Three: AKs
-Round Four and onwards: Someone buys an AWP, rest buy AKs and Armor

Counter Terrorists (assuming they win each round)
-Round One: Five Seven or Armor plus Decoy
-Round Two: Some SMG
-Round Three: P90 or M4/M4A1-S
-Round Four and onwards: Someone buys an AWP, rest buy M4/M4A1-S or P90 and Armor

Eco Round? Doesn't exist in low Silver xD
Save? Doesn't really happen
Strategy? ""B"", ""Rush B Blyat"", ""Long A"", ""Short A"", ""A split"" and that's about it.
You WILL get yelled at if you use the Autosnipers, P90, camp with an AWP or ""accidentally"" teamkill.

-Rank up System

CS:GO has 2 rank systems, one for the whole game in which you get random items drops when you level up and one that is only applicable in Competitive which determines the skill level of players you will play with/against. Having a separate rank system for Competitive is a great idea, as it encourages players to play more and work as a team. However this can be abused, and Valve can't really do anything about it.

-Smurfing

A ""smurf"" is basically someone who is reasonably experienced at the game and  creates/buys an alt account to play against others who have a lower skill level. You can detect smurfs by looking at their steam profiles, if they have few friends, low hours in other games etc. 

If you manage to kill a smurf, rub it in their face. You killed someone who most likely has a far higher skill ceiling than you did, and tilting them is a perfect way to get them mad and not thinking logically. Sure its a dirty tactic, but who really cares in this game.

-VAC System/Overwatch

Yeah not much of an expert on this one, since I can't really detect subtle hackers etc. However I think it's a little better than the TF2 VAC system, since players in the community can review evidence sent to them (if they have Overwatch) and make the decision.

-Community

I've heard many times that the CS:GO community is ""toxic"" and ""cancer"" because of the people that play the game. It's true, if you play this game you WILL meet horrible and mean people who sweat and scream when they die. But thats what makes CS:GO stand out from other games, it's much more than a game for millions of players. Many people basically spend all their time playing this game, and I don't blame them. Personally I can't get bored of this game, there is always something new you can do. Without the ""toxic"" community CS:GO probably would not drag in as many players as it has currently, but that's just my opinion. In game the community is very vocal, with about half the players using a mic to yell/call strats/communicate (good or bad?).

-Stereotypical CS:GO players in Australia/NZ

""Sweaty Nerds"" who play basically nonstop
Unmarried Adult Males who yell at their teammates- ""Yo, this guy is literally a 20 year old male!""
Guys who pretend to be girls with their profile pics but you realize they're not :/
Cuties and Hotties (right here)
Rich Kiddies who spend money on skins to look sexy but they suck at the game (here again...)
Australian Bogans (basically Russians here)
Anime Profile Pic who is really good at the game
People with no skins that do really well 
12vie micspammers...jeez there a lot of them
Grill Gamers
People who add you because of your skins and make crazy offers for them


-YouTube presence/MLG CS:GO

There are a TON of amazing CS:GO YouTubers out there. I recommend you check out WarOwl, MojoOnPC, Sparkles, Nick Bunyun, 3kliksPhillip etc. The tutorials can be pretty helpful, and give you some game sense. 

I know NOTHING about MLG CS:GO but it seems pretty big. I basically chose a team at random, Envyus, and supported them.
PashaBiceps will always be my favorite player though, since he balances out his time spend gaming with exersize to keep fit.

-CS:GO Skins and Cases

I've already spent around 450 dollars to buy the skins I want. Hey, it's better than wasting thousands gambling away money to dodgy websites. Also I wouldn't recommend unboxing CS:GO Cases, as you should just buy off the Community Market and not rely on luck to make unlikely profit. However if you have money you want to waste unbox away and pray for a knife/glove.

-Valve/Game Developers

Eh, I've seen many reviews saying that ""CS:GO is dying/Valve pays no attention to the game anymore/OMG Valve is ditching us for Dota!!"" and this possibly could be true. Valve just wants money, like any business would. However I don't really any need for Valve to do much more than make sure the game is balanced and running correctly (Unlike TF2 which has a 5 man development team). Note again that this is just my current opinion, since I'm still a newbie to the game.

-Friendly Aspect to the game?

Knife fights mid don't really count, and the only friendly game I played was on Cache with people spraying dicks on the wall. I left that one, what a surprise. CS:GO is a VERY competitive game, so I wouldn't reccomend going friendly as you'll most likely get killed and kicked. Stick to Hightower.

-Overall Opinion

It's an amazingly good game, it could do with a little bit more attention from Valve but has a huge player base (constantly second most played on steam) and will not ""die"" anytime soon. The community is very...diverse...but don't take anything mean they say seriously and you should be gucci okay :) The game is played across the globe, hence the name GLOBAL offensive and will be for many years to come.

1198,"Whether you're a casual FPS gamer or a very competitive hard-core player, CS:GO is where it's at.  
A large variety of game modes from frantic action to tactical matches that rely on strategy as heavily as skill give this title plenty of value.  There is no single player campaign, though playing with bots is always an option.  CS:GO's highly polished gameplay and graphics that look fine without being too flashy let you concentrate on playing a game rather than crazy visuals.  It can't be understated that the HUD stays very clean unlike most modern shooters (Battlefield and COD, I'm looking at you!).
Unlike previous CS titles, GO includes a weapon drop system similar to DOTA 2 or TF2 but all weapons are skins and merely for aesthetics.  You can actually sell your free weapon drops on the Steam market if you're lucky!  I've personally made $30 steam bucks so far. 
For competitive gamers, CS:GO is one of the largest Esports in the world (and THE largest FPS).  The DreamHack Winter 2013 tournament featured a prize pool of $250,000!  It's easy to get started because there is a great in-game Competitive matchmaker that throws together teams of 5v5.  With any internet game, you're going to meet some jerks, but I've had a great experience with the matchmaker and have made a lot of Steam friends that have taught me a lot.  Don't be discouraged by the learning curve.  With great effort, comes great rewards!  Now GO buy it!!",True

English

Counter Strike: Global Offensive is a very cool game. This game has everything a good shooter needs, lots of players, weapons, maps, modes. Above all, the game shines with its own system, which is a lot of fun and rewards good teamwork. In classic mode, anti-terrorists fight terrorists, the task of the terrorists is to place a bomb in one of the two locations (A or B on each map) and to protect it until it detonates. The task of the anti-terrorists is of course to prevent this. You can also simply kill all the players of a team to win a round. The teams are swapped after half of the match is played, this makes it very fair. It is worth using the voice chat to give your mates calls and tips. This way you can improve your English skills significantly (more than at school). Of course you sometimes meet people who are not nice and who have had a bad day, but that's the case in every game. All in all, CS: GO is a good tactical multiplayer shoter, which has remained good to this day. The advantages of this game outweigh the disadvantages. You can't go wrong with taking a look.

Counter Strike: Global Offensive ist ein sehr cooles Spiel. Dieses Spiel hat alles was ein guter Shooter benötigt, viele Spieler, Waffen, Karten und Modi. Dieses spiel glänzt vor allem mit seinem eigenen System, welches sehr viel Spaß macht und eine gute Teamarbeit belohnt. Im Klassischen Modus treten Anti-Terroristen gegen Terroristen an, die Aufgabe der Terroristen ist es dabei, eine Bombe an einem der beiden Orte (A oder B) zu platzieren und diese so lange zu beschützen bis sie detoniert. Die Aufgabe der Anti-Terroristen ist natürlich dies zu verhindern. Es können auch einfach alle spieler eines Teams können auch ganz einfach eliminiert werden, um eine Runde zu gwinnen. Die Teams werden nachdem die Hälfte des Match gespielt wurde gewechselt. Das macht es sehr fair. Es lohnt sich den voicechat zu verwenden, um seinen Mitspielern Calls und Tipps zu geben. So kann man sein Englisch deutlich verbessern (mehr als in der Schule). Natürlich trifft man auch manchmal auf leute die nicht nett sind und einen schlechten Tag hatten, aber das ist in jedem spiel so. Alles in allem ist Csgo ein sehr guter Taktischer Multilpayer Shooter, welcher sich bis Heute sehr gut gehalten hat. Die Vorteile dieses Spiels überwiegen.

1201,"Since an old fan of Halo games i find, CS:GO a nice sequel to the franchise. You can jump with p90, AWP or AK and make headshots, like a true spartan.

I like it, since with p90 is so ez that i'm eagle right now and i'm going supreme easly, only thanks to this weapon.
Then the real DLC that this game deserve: The russians. Halo had no russian, and this game is full of it. 

Since the game is so easy that is more hard to play in silver levels than in eagle levels, the Russians make the game quite challenging. Like when you got one in your team, you know that the game will be a thug battle.

[b]Pros of the game:[/b]
[list]
[*] A new additional line of weapons to play around with, each having better improvements to handling. Though beware, some updates can nerf these, since CS:GO patches can be unreliable at times.

[*] Cool and stylish weapon graphics you can purchase over the market for personalising your own, unique firearm selections.

[*] The new game mode selections of competitive, casual, death-match, arms race (formally known as gun-game), and demolition.

[*] A whole new range of maps on top of the remastered originals.

[*] All the more Counter-Terrorist and Terrorist skins players will have featured during different level matches.

[*] They've laid off including the 'lifetime stats' section a fair bit, with only game achievements this time featured on player profiles, making it much more pleasant for perfectionists like myself instead of feeling like always needing to improve on things all the more. I can just get that sense gnawing at me sometimes to ‘do better’ when I always have to see stats in my face, even with it already sound.

[*] The achievements themselves being lesser in kill counts for weapons than before, making it much more tolerable and faster to get through.

[*] Having the addition of game music, such as the main menu theme, the match-starting theme and the victory themes are quite nice for a game jingle. Plus the addition of custom theme tracks you can get for your client.
[/list]

[b]Cons of the game:[/b]
[list]
[*] The match-making system for Competitive having constant flaws.

[*] Competitive players you can come across in 80% of random matches being complete idiots and / or trolls, as well as those who try to get the whole team to surrender from a 'bad start' at the beginning of a game itself - even if you're carrying to give a worthwhile chance. To put it simple; the majority of games have players who are absolutely horrendous at listening to team tactics, then can also try kicking you thinking they’re a 'top-gun', when in reality they’re the ones who suck. Basically; you never got this in CS:S, as everyone knew the usual play of routine and worked together. In this it just seems to have gone right out the window.

[*] There's still players you will come across who hack and use aim-bot, walls, etc, legitimately (and not just as some cry out with people hacking since they're actually good). The liberty at least is the game features a player reporting system you can consult while playing, where you can submit a claim for staff to investigate if you feel a player is literally hacking. If they're found guilty; you'll have a confirmation message show up later on your main menu screen that action had been taken against them - most commonly being banned from community servers.

[*] As with the Counter-Strike franchise; there shall always be unfortunate hit-box issues - with the all familiar problem of blood splatter appearing on an enemy, yet they have no or hardly any damage rendered at all.

[*]Competitive is a joke really. You’re not even getting anything for wins besides a pointless ‘rank’ score (which at that is only effected by your chance of having MVP’s and winning, and not your actual kill / death score as it should be based upon), and if you know you’re good - you’re good. Even getting to 'Legendary Eagle' prior myself, I’m frankly not caring anymore or playing consecutively, as it’s so boring without proper teams of friends like back in CS:S league matches.

[*] The 'weapon crates' from the point system you actually have to fork out more than they're worth to open, usually getting something cheap wasting your money.

1220,"CS:GO is a world famous FPS known for its intense, unique, and deep gameplay and its strong presence in the eSports scene. It's also the game that, at the time of writing this review, I have put the most hours into. It's so addicting, and if you find the right team to play with that communicates and strategizes, is an absolute blast and one of the best FPS games I have ever played.

[h1]Positives[/h1]
[list]
[*][b]Great graphics.[/b] The graphics on this game have aged well and look good. They're solid enough to not make you go blind.
[*][b]Built on the Source engine.[/b] I've always been a fan of the Source engine. It's very easy to run on any PC, has solid graphics, a deep options menu, which means the game is avaliable to tons of people.
[*][b]Great Gameplay.[/b] With smooth movement, unique spray patterns on all the guns, deep strategies gameplay wise and economically wise, ability to move silently, and more, CS:GO's gameplay is awesome. I like it a lot, and I find it very unique. The movement is smooth as well.
[*][b]Everyone is on an even playing field.[/b] The skills of a player only rely on their aim, reflexes, and expertise of the game, not XP like in CoD. For example, the other team can't automatically win just because they are all above level 50 and your team is a bunch of level 2s and 3s.
[*][b]Balanced maps.[/b] The maps of CS:GO are fine tuned, expertly crafted, and are all unique in their own ways. The defuse maps are constantly updated with tweaks to make them the best that they can be. Some maps receive complete makeovers, such as Train and Nuke, with Dust2 possibly recieving one very soon. The hostage and demolition maps are usually left in the dust as they're underplayed, but they're still solid maps.
[*][b]Operations.[/b] These are special events that Valve hold every couple months called Operations. For the price of $7, you can play two player co-op missions with a buddy and get case drops that you can turn around and sell for a dollar or two. Valve also release specially picked community-made maps that everyone can play for free.
[*][b]Community Servers.[/b] These servers host custom maps from the workshop. They also host custom gamemodes such as 1v1 and Surf.
[*][b]Skins.[/b] I find skins overall neat. While Valve can throw in some ugly and stupid skins, most of the skins are awesome, and are affordable. Some skins range from 3 pennies to thousands of dollars. The only skins I buy are ones that are under a dollar, with my rifle skins being a few dollars. There's likely no way in a million years I'm buying a thousand dollar skin.
[*][b]Gamemodes for both casual and hardcore gamers.[/b] While hardcore players will grind competitive defuse for hours a day, there's gamemodes for the casual player too, such as Arms Race, Deathmatch, and a casual version of defuse that is easier than competitive defuse.
[*][b]Able to host your own server.[/b] While you can buy dedicated servers from various server hosters across the web, you can host your own server off your PC for free by downloading server files directly from Valve, and install custom plugins. I recently started to host my own server for me and a friend where I made it into a 1v1 server. While it's tough to set up, which happens with every server, it's awesome that you can do it for free.
[/list]

[h1]Mixed[/h1]
[list]
[*][b]Toxic community.[/b] While there's teammates that are supportive and will communicate and strategize with you, there's also teammates that will insult and harass you if you aren't playing well. They will scream ""He's over there, dumba**! A MAIN!"" in your ear while you're trying to focus on the game. It's insanely annoying, and always gets you killed. Because you died, he'll start a vote to kick you. Screw those toxic POSs. There's teammates that have no idea what they're doing and will run and gun like it's CoD, along with having awful crosshair placement, so they'll be looking at walls when they die. There's teammates that will yell into their mic and act like they're funny. It's a community that's a dense minefield of good and bad, and one bad player can completely ruin your experience.
[*][b]Glove Skins.[/b] While I think skins are awesome, I think they're good enough on the guns. Valve have made glove skins, which I rarely see people use. It's just silly to make glove skins while people have been asking for 128 tick servers and a stricter anti-cheat for ages.
[/list]

[h1]Negatives[/h1]
[list]
[*][b]VAC isn't the best.[/b] While Valve has been fighting cheaters with VAC and the recent creation of the Overwatch system, where specially picked CSGO players can review footage of reported players and judge if they're cheating, hackers are still thriving in CSGO. It's an infamous issue that has plagued the game for ages. While they aren't in every single match you play, they still exist, especially in the higher ranks of competitive.
[*][b]Gambing and Match Betting.[/b] Skins have caused negative things to happen that Valve weren't anticipating. People will gamble skins on coin flips and such, which leads into the skin gambling contraversy that exploded not too long ago, and people will bet on matches with skins. It's just sketchy stuff, and has generated some toxicitiy in the CSGO community.
[*][b]64 tick servers.[/b] I think 128 tick servers are needed, especially for a game as competitive as CSGO. With all the money Valve has made from CSGO, it's likely that they can update their servers to 128 tick so gameplay is smoother and server-side issues aren't as much of a problem.
[/list]

[h1]Summary[/h1]
Despite all the toxicity associated with the game, CSGO is still a great game in my eyes. It's a unique FPS that I will happily play for many more hours to come so I can hone my skills and become a dominant player.

1221,"My brother is an ""avid amateur chess player"". That's how he describes himself when making small talk.

You should see his room. It's full of dumb chess pieces from different sets, like his favorite Gold Pawn. It's not really gold but he claims it is. (Nobody believes him)

So anyway, one time I went to his room and I saw a new addition to his collection. It was a giant paper mache bishop. Like, 3 feet tall. He obviously made it himself because it was crooked and I saw yesterday's news on the Bishop's belly.

But what really attracted me to the giant bishop was its unproportionally small head. The whole thing was like a freaky baby milk bottle.

So approached the artifact, and I bit the tip off. 

Unfortunately for me, my brother saw me do it.

Unfortunately for him, I move as quick as a fox.

I was a dancing blur of after image, avoiding every attack he tried to throw at me. I slipped past him and dashed straight to the safety of my dad's room. I locked myself in until the angry beast outside calmed down.

Then I asked myself, [i]""Self, what do I do now?""[/i].

1231,"Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is a first-person shooter and the next generation of Counter-Strike running on updated Source Engine and has many new features added.

The gameplay is also has been revamped so even new players can play the game without much difficulty. No need to buy weapons ammo anymore. There are many new game modes such as deathmatch, arms race and the competitive online match. There's also the new Arms Deal update where each weapons now has many skins which can be acquired when you play on VAC enabled servers in a timed based item drops or by opening a weapons case with certain bought keys. Weapons skins can be used to show off, traded or sold on Steam marketplace. You can even change your weapons name and add some description about it. You can also submit your own weapon skins or maps if you have the creativity so that maybe Valve will add it in the next game update, therefore supporting the game even further.

Graphics in Counter-Strike: Global Offensive has been vastly improved. Characters model are all fresh new while retaining the same design and faction with some new faction added. The map is upgraded even better to look more realistic than ever. The new Source Engine also made the ragdoll physic effect and many effects feels more realistic. Despite all of the upgraded graphics, the game runs amazingly smooth and optimized and doesn't really need high-end system.

Oh, but before you buy this or even play the game, you better be ready to throw yourself into a real hot zone out there, as the community of this game is... well... unforgiving. You either die as a noob or live long enough to get a title hacker.

This is yet the best Counter-Strike game where casual and hardcore gamers can play. I recommend this.

Rating 9/10",True
1232,"Counter-Strike is a sport, pastime, and a Game of Recreation so full of delight and pleasure at times, that I know not any Game in that respect is to be preferred before it; and for the Excellency of this Recreation is much approved of, and plaid by the whole World. In its ill Repute, even in moderate doses, 'tis not so healthful, and would be much more commendable than it is, were it not for those swarms of Cheats and Loosers which so pester the Art therein.

Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is the most present incarnation of the Game; and upon closer inspection, against its antecedents, stands as the most Bug-free of all, and thus the most Boring; for if these Games were Dogs, Counter-Strike 1.6 and Counter-Strike: Source would still possess Testes, while Global Offensive would doubtlessly be a neutered boredom; what is lost in this sterilisation is the Rapscallionism of the Bug-exploiter (the Trickster), and consequently the descension of the Skill-ceiling.

Counter-Strike is a strategic First Person Shooter; not only must a Gamester hone his dexterity in handling his Weapon, but must prudently handle his Estate, lest he become a Monetary Leak to his fellow Gamesters and become an ineffectual Player on Critical Rounds owing to meagre means to attack or defend the Objective, and to coordinate with his Allies his own positioning in relation to where They stand and the Adversary. It is plaid Competitively, and for High Estate around the Globe, as a five versus five Player Scrimage.

During your Career, of which I hope you decide whether 'tis or not early; like whether one would like to keep an open Wound oozing, you will wayfare into many Fools. Be on your guard against the the Excitable ones, Allies or Adversary, for any perceived Wrongdoing unto them; they will react with such a force of hysteria that you would think you were in the presence of someone medically certified as having eaten on the Insane Root which has so often taken the Gamester's Reason prisoner 'till Games' ultimation. And treat the Soviets well, for they truly have nothing to lose in the Game of Life that is so especially coldly miserable and without Meaning.

A Word about Computer Specifics and Peripherals of The Gamester: If one is to rightly challenge another Gamester, one must contest on an even Table. The Board must be level'd as exactly as may be, so that the Ball of their Skill may run true upon any part of the Table without leaning to any partial side thereof. An even Table, such which are exactly level'd are highly valuable by a good Player; for at a false Table it is impossible for him to show the Excellency of his Art and Skill.

Since recreation is a thing lawful in it self, if not abused, I cannot but commend this Game with caution; for there are many Cheats to be plaid at this Game ⁠— not Pure Art; and therefore I shall only caution you when you go to play, that you suffer not your self to be over-matcht, and do not, when you meet with a better Gamester than your self, condemn the Table. And consider not only your loss of time which is invaluable, but the damage also the very watching brings to your Health, and in particular the Eyes and Mind.

To conclude, let me advise you, if you play (when your business will permit) let not a covetous desire of playing as well as your betters engage you to Cheat; which will not only disturb your mind, but by the disreputation of being a Gamester, if you lose not your Game, you will certainly lose your Credit and good Name, than which there is nothing more valuable.",True

1252,"Counter Strike: Global Offensive is one of those games that is kind of hard not to recommend. It's a solid shooter and it is cheap and looks really good for a game that runs on the Source engine. To new players CSGO may feel a little ""back to the basics"" as this game does not have aiming down the sight, unlocks, attachments, perks and killstreaks so it's heavily based on player skill and not on selecting the perfect loadout with the perfect perks. This game does have a ranking system but it's different from all the other shooters which I'll explain later on. But the game does show a lot of depth as you play more and you will find out that not everything is as straight forward as it might have looked. It's also a tactical teamplay based shooter, so don't even think about buying it if you don't like teamplay. Only a good team can lead you to victory, not a highly skilled lone wolf.

CSGO offers a small variety of game modes, those are: Deathmatch, Arms race, Demolition, Classic casual and Classic competitive. For those of you who are familiar with COD Arms race is called Gun game in COD. You start off with a weapon and every time you kill someone you'll advance to the next weapon until you get a golden knife, kill someone with the golden knife and you win the game. What's rather interesting about Arms race is that you still play in teams 5v5 but the one who killed enemies with all weapons wins. Demolition is a combination between Classic (I’ll explain classic later in the review) and arms race. The goal is to plant the bomb as a terrorist or defend the bombsites as a counter terrorist or defuse the bomb if its planted, there are no respawns and instead of buying a weapon you start with one and advance to the next weapon if you made any kills during the last round and if you made more than one kill you'll get extra rewards like frag grenades and flash bangs. In my opinion those game modes are fun but unnecessary because I never really feel the need to play them.

There's also deathmatch which is a little different from the usual (team)deathmatch. It's played 5V5 and all weapons are available except for grenades. you play in a team but it's every man for himself as the person with the most points at the end of a round wins. What's also interesting about Deathmatch is that different weapons give a different amount of points and at some point during deathmatch certain weapons give bonus points. In my opinion deathmatch shouldn't be taken to serious, It's a good gamemode to improve your aim, and I know most new players will jump right into deathmatch but that's in my opinion not the way Counter Strike is supposed to be played.

So that leaves Classic casual and Classic competitive which are almost the same gamemodes, therefore I’ll use this section to talk about the things these gamemodes have in common and in the next section the differences between these gamemodes. Classic consists of the two original Counter Strike game modes: defuse mission and hostage mission. In hostage mission the counter terrorists have to kill all the terrorists or rescue one of the hostages (in the other counter strike games all the hostages have to be rescued) and the terrorists have to prevent the counter terrorists from rescuing the hostages by killing all of the counter terrorists. In defuse mission the terrorists have to plan a bomb at one of the two bombsites and make it explode or kill all the counter terrorists and the counter terrorists have to win by killing all the terrorists or by defusing the bomb if it's planted in which case killing all the terrorists does not result in victory. Both defusal mission and hostage mission have a money system. You'll receive money for all sorts of things, playing a round, of course the winning team receives more in most cases, completing a part of the objective like taking a hostage or planting the bomb and kills. The kill reward depends on the weapon, a rifle or pistol will give you 1× kill reward while an SMG (except for P90) gives you 2× kill reward, a shotgun gives 3× kill reward and a knife gives 5× kill reward while the AWP gives only 0,5× kill reward. At the start of a new round you can buy weapons and grenades with the money you earned and the money you don't spend will carry over to the next round.

So now the differences between casual and competitive. In casual you play either terrorist or counter terrorist and the best team out of 15 rounds wins, in competitive the teams are swapt after the 15th round and the best team out of 30 rounds wins. In casual you'll receive more money if you lose a round, less if you win a round and the kill reward for a rifle is 150 bucks while a kill with a rifle in competitive rewards 300, the developer did it this way to balance the difference in money between the good and bad team and the good and bad players in casual. Competitive is played 5V5 and casual can be played 10V10. In competitive you have to buy your armor and your defuse kit while you get those for free in casual. In casual you can just drop in a round and leave whenever you desire while in competitive you join at the start of a game and you're not supposed to leave until the game is finished, because if you do you'll get a penalty in the form of a temporary competitive ban ranging between half an hour and 7 days and I've seen screenshots of people getting over 200 days competitive cooldown. This is both fair and unfair as it will punish the players who ragequit, the more they ragequit the longer the cooldown, but sometimes you can lose connection to the server because of server problems or internet problems in which case you'll also receive a cooldown which is highly unfair. If you play casual you'll play with random people while competitive has a ranking system based on your skill and win/lose ratio and you'll play with people of the same skill level as you.

There's also a community server browser with servers that have different game rules, use community maps or even have completely different game modes. I don't spend a lot of time on community servers so I can't tell you more than this.

In my opinion competitive is the way to play CSGO, I spend by far most of my time playing competitive. Casual is great for practice but keep in mind that people play different on competitive. If you're new though I advice to play a few rounds on casual before playing competitive so you can learn how the gamemode works, how the economy system works and gain some map knowledge, why should you do this in casual? Well competitive is way more serious. There's also an option to play against bots if you're new to shooters but even expert bots are pretty easy to defeat and play really different than human players.

The only negative points I can come up with is that the servers have to be improved as hit detection doesn't always works as it is supposed to work, and the ranking system has to be improved. At the time of writing I am silver elite master (fifth rank) but some silver elites (fourth rank) are way better than me and some golden nova 2 players (seventh rank) are much worse. And they could crank up the difficulty of the bots as medium bots in CS:S are way harder than expert bots in CSGO making bot practice less useful.

Over the last year this has definitely become my favorite shooter, I even watch CSGO E-sport. It's a crown jewel and it only costs 14 bucks. I give CSGO a 10/10. This doesn't mean the game is perfect, of course it can be improved but it's based on the fun factor, and even though I sometimes HATE this game out of pure frustration, I'll always come back to it and there are barely any games out there that can do that. Everyone who remotely likes shooters should buy it.",True
1253,"[b]CS:GO is the game of the 21th century![/b]

I like it that much that I started hosting community servers at the beginning of 2016. After a short time I named the -=WarmupServer=-s, because you can train your aim and warmup for the Competetive Matchmaking-, Faceit-, ESEA-Games. There you play 5vs5 with four teammates. This part of the game combines tactics and dexterity.

However if you start with that game, it will take some time to get into it! But keep it up! You will hate it, you will love it, but in the end you will say it is the best game for real E-Sports! The 18 different ranks of matchmaking helps haveing fun even if you are a beginner.

If you get into the game, you will start editing your config and working with the console. Here is a nice shortcut for your personal userconfig:

alias dust2 ""connect 85.14.232.128:27015""

If you have installed that, you just need to enter dust2 into your console and you will connect to the 24slot MultiCFG DUST2 server. However, if the server is full, you need a reserved slot (VIP), to join a server like this. Of course this is working with all my servers!
There are a lot of other things you can do with your config. Just google it.

Have fun & best wishes!!!

Recomended Updates to make the game better
1.  Make a proper anti cheat system.(VAC is a joke considering it is a mostly competetive game)
2. The ranking system should be updated. It is really shi***.

Other wise the game is really enjoyable, but newplayers should not get disheartened considereding a large chunk players have been  have been playing for over 18 years, all the way from the days of 1.6 and are very skilled. Playing this game requires atleast some skill even in the Silver league. So it is reccomend the player practises several Casual matches before jumping into the Competeve games.

The competitive scene have grown, and I think thats great. Unlike some other FPS, cs requires skill and training.

- Reasonable price (minus low discount rates for those want another copy.)
- Cheapest Steam trading cards on Steam Market.
- Still a ""classic"" FPS game in terms of gameplay.
- Source Engine is not power hungry and thus the game is widely accessible for lots of players regardless of their computer setups; this is one of the important factors to be a popular game.

CONS:
- Skins (you can't have all because: rarity, monies, life issues, et cetera.)
- Stickers (some are ugly.)
- Competitive matches (they can ""rekt"" your mind.)
- It is somewhat hard to find and make a correct teabag position to desecrate fallen foes and allies due to ragdoll physics being client sided (you often see teabaggers teabagging side by dead bodies, not exactly on the bodies.) Teabaggagement must be well practiced with rich malintent and delicacy in order to execute and demonstrate a successful teabaggary to variety of audiences.
- You can't kill hostages anymore unlike in previous [url=http://store.steampowered.com/sub/54030/][i]Counter-Strike[/i][/url] games.
- You miss the Arctic Avengers and terrorists in the green jackets.
- Multi-GPU setups (SLI or CF) can potentially cause stuttering issues and even some FPS drop.
- AWP needed nerf? (3/31/2015 update.)
- StatTrak swap tool (3/31/2015 update.)

I believe you will get the most fun of this game only when you play LAN with your friends against your friends. Official competitive, as well as FACEIT, ESEA etc. makes me feel like this game is trash eventhough I know that the whole negative is all about its community.

1280,"This game has a crazy in-depth story line with insanely insightful philosophy into the terrorism battle that is haunting the United States. This game is all about terrorists vs. counter - terrorists and it makes you see both sides of the story and how sometimes the terrorists just need a little bit of love. This game really unveils the whole ""Bush did 9/11"" conspiracy and proves how steel beams can be destroyed by bombs. In fact, anything can be destroyed by bombs. That is why terrorists have an inert advantage when it comes to tactical warfare; however, the counter - terrorists have many tools themselves, such as powerful guns and the powers to defuse the bombs that the terrorists plant. All in all, I would have to say this game is pretty interesting in the whole terrorism fiasco that America is going through right now and is definitely insightful into many things concerning Osama bin Laden and whether the fact that Obama is black or an alien.

Unless you have 4 other friends to play with, more often than not you're going to be matched with trolls, griefers and/or bad players, which becomes extremely frustrating.

Other than that, goes on sale all of the time and is a lot of fun. If you have the friends or think you can meet some whilst playing then I really can't recommend it enough.

1. The Russian language.
2. How to be a tough guy that is afraid of nothing behind a screen.

5. How awesome it feels to shout through your microphone and giving invalid instructions while someone is trying to pull off a clutch.
6. How to be disappointed in human beings.
7. How to socialise in a civilised and calm manner (/s).
And last but not least, how to be a complete asshole for no reason at all.

Aside from that, if you're willing to ignore the aforementioned it can be a truly great game. It has many goals for you to achieve if you wish other than the obvious goal of getting the highest ranking possible. You could always aim to get that gorgeous weapon skin you always wanted potentially without spending any money at all. It is highly recommended you find a few people to play with as solo queue is extremely toxic, harsh and often rude, as in every other game that has competitive matchmaking. Having 4 people to play with can be extremely fun since you can easily bond together and have fun either you win or lose. It's a good game and I do recommend it as long as you're willing to ignore the (Admittedly plenty of) things that are wrong with this game. Even if you don't, it can easily be worth it if your skin is thick enough or you can utilize (If you got the balls really) self-deprecation humour.",True

1298,"[i]The following review is based on the Linux version[/i]

The Counter-Strike series is from long term perspective one of the best in FPS genre. Global Offensive improves already proven gameplay mechanics, keeps adding new features and it's one of the best first person shooter games ever made.

Perfect optimalization, nice graphics and excellent gameplay. Counter-Strike is one of the few games that ignore today's console-like elements like auto-heal and the player has to think and focus to get the objective done instead of simple ""run and gun (and die)"". That's why is CS sometimes called ""a chess with guns"".
CSGO is the best multiplayer first-person shooter I've ever played. Yes, the community is often horrible but fortunately it's possible to meet nice people as well.

I've played more than 1000 hours (100% on Linux) and I didn't have a single crash or anything like that. So much fun, so many memories, so many nights spent playing with my friends. This game has a special place in my heart. Of course I had a lot of ""I will uninstall this **** and never play it again"" moments but it's IMO totally fine in a competitive game like CS.

1309,"So, [b]Counter-Strike: Global Offensive[/b]... here we are.

I have owned this game for over a year and haven't really started playing it until recently.

My first impressions of the game were that aiming made completely no sense and that I couldn't understand what a single location call out meant period. I soon left CS GO to go back to other games I was playing at the time such as Dota 2 (another Valve game that has tons of hats) and H1Z1 (a game that has tons of hats because it wants to be like Valve).

I recently came back to CS GO and have found a much deeper appreciation for it. While I did promise myself when I first got it that I wouldn't go crazy with buying skins, I recently did binge on getting a skin for every weapon. Most skins however were very cheap and I didn't dare attempt to go after a knife since I suck with sneaking up on people anyway.

Now unto the actual review. Through practicing in [b]Team Death Match[/b], I've been learning how to use the weapons a lot more efficiently. I'm still nowhere near good but I do actually understand that tapping rather than spraying tends to result in a lot more people dying. When I'm more advanced at the game I'll begin to study how the spray patterns work in more detail so I'm not only tapping left click for all my shots but utilizing the spray more effectively as well.

If you're playing the [b]Casual[/b] game modes, I'd say it's fine to solo queue because it's quite laid back.

For [b]Competitive[/b] I tend to like to queue up with full lobby or with at least 1 other person. It makes it feel more fulfilling to either share in the victory or the defeat together.

[h1]For anyone on the fence about this game or gave it up after not understanding why none of their bullets ever landed on their targets:[/h1]

[list]
    [*]This game might go on sale for $7.50 around Christmas time. For this price or even a price near that, it's a must have in my opinion.
    [*]Don't spray at your targets when you're starting off. If you don't know spray patterns you'll just get destroyed and will barely be able to kill anyone. Always try to tap in an almost even rhythm if possible so your shots will be more accurate.
    [*]Don't worry about winning or losing in the casual gamemodes(non-competitive). As far as I've realized so far, people may say things such as ""[i]rekt[/i]"" or ""[i]get owned[/i]"" but in the end your calibrated rank isn't being affected by these types of matches.
    [*]Use new player friendly weapons when you're beginning such as the P90 when you're playing with friends that are more seasoned when they want to play actual games. When you are on your own or are doing death match rounds, use the trickier weapons such as the AK47 or AWP in situations where ultimately whatever happens people won't care about as much.
[/list]

I hope this was somewhat helpful. I'm still new but I have found a new love for this game. I'm pretty sure that once I start solo queuing in Competitive at some point that it'll be like Dota 2 where none of my team mates will speak English and things will be... [i]interesting[/i]. Well with that said, I'm off to play some more CS GO!",True

I probably don't have to tell you if you will like this game or not. The Counter-Strike franchise is pretty well known in the gaming industry. For those who have been living under a rock for the past 17 years, Counter-Strike is a round-based FPS with two teams trying to either: 1. kill the enemy team or 2. fulfil the objective. There is a huge online community and many custom maps and game-types. Essentially it can be as competitive or as casual as you like.

1340,"Global Offensive sprawia wrażenie przygotowanego pod dzisiejsze standardy, ale twórcy nie zapomnieli o klasyce. Po odpaleniu wita nas odświeżone menu, radykalnie zmienione w stosunku do prostych menusów, jakie widywaliśmy wcześniej. I tutaj zaczyna się kolejna zmiana, czyli podział gry. Dostajemy do wyboru – albo bawimy się według zasad ustalonych z góry przez Valve, albo wybieramy standardowe, prywatne serwery. Pierwsza opcja jest ciekawa z punktu widzenia początkujących osób, które nie są zbyt dobrze obeznane w zasadach, którymi rządzi się seria. Dostają bowiem możliwość wyboru, w jakich wariantach chcą się bawić, a następnie ruszają na znaleziony przez produkcję serwer.

Trybów jest kilka, poczynając od bawiącego nas od dawna odbijania zakładników i podkładania bomb. Studio rozszerzyło jednak zakres konkurencji, dokładając Wyścig Zbrojeń i Demolkę. Ten pierwszy to nic innego jak synonim popularnego ""gungame"", gdzie po zabiciu określonej ilości graczy zdobywamy nową broń, a po śmierci niemal od razu wracamy do życia i ruszamy przed siebie. Rozgrywka jest szybka, giniemy co chwilę, ale zabawy przy tym jest naprawdę sporo, a przy tym to bardzo dobry sposób na trening strzelecki przed poważniejszymi wyzwaniami. Demolka to połączenie Wyścigu zbrojeń z klasycznym „plantowaniem”. Nową broń dostajemy co rundę, po zlikwidowaniu przeciwnika. Zabawa toczy się na specjalnie ku temu przygotowanych lokacjach, z tylko jednym miejscem na podłożenie ładunku, a do tego same mapki są mniejsze i jakby bardziej intymne, niż ma to miejsce w klasycznych trybach.
Skoro już przy mapach jesteśmy, to należy im się kilka słów. Valve oddaje do naszej dyspozycji domyślnie kilka klasycznych plansz – Aztec, dust, dust 2, Office, Inferno, Italy, Nuke i Train. Są to lokacje-legendy, z garścią modyfikacji. Na jednych dodano dodatkowe przejścia, na innych poprzestawiano/dołożono/usunięto skrzynki czy inne osłony. W przypadku „Italki” aranżacja dodatkowego tunelu okazała się bardzo trafnym pomysłem, bo o ile wcześniej plansza ta bardzo mocno faworyzowała zespół terrorystów, to teraz szanse są niemal równe po obu stronach. To samo tyczy się pierwszego dusta, gdzie w podziemnym tunelu wyżłobiono boczny korytarz, po którym grzecznie schodkami można wejść na most, co wyrównuje z kolei szanse „tych złych”. Na reszcie mapek, jak już wspomniałem, zmiany są głównie kosmetyczne i w sumie ciężko ocenić to, czy wyszły one na dobre, czy na złe. Prócz klasyków mamy też kilka mniejszych lokacji do nowych trybów, robiących jak najbardziej pozytywne wrażenie. W ciągu najbliższych miesięcy pojawią się zaś fanowskie mapki, które bardzo często prezentują nieprzeciętny poziom. Na nie musimy jednak nieco poczekać.
Sporo wyrazów już za nami, a tymczasem nie było jeszcze ani słowa na temat rozgrywki, a ta jest tutaj motywem przewodnim, nad którym twórcy wylali pewnie najwięcej potu. Po pierwsze i najważniejsze – to wciąż jest Counter-Strike. Możecie mówić, że gameplay nieco zalatuje Team Fortressem i być może trochę racji w tym jest, ale jądro rozgrywki pozostaje niezmienne. Brak możliwości strzelania przez szczerbinkę, brak przybliżenia (prócz sprzętu z lunetą rzecz jasna) czy kule latające według własnego widzimisię – to właśnie CS. Strzelanie w biegu jest totalnie pozbawione sensu, bo zamiast podziurawić przeciwnika, podziurawimy powietrze. Tutaj liczy się precyzja, trzeba przystanąć, oddać krótką i celną serię, najlepiej prosto w głowę, i iść dalej. Prucie ołowiem na oślep czy walenie po nogach daje tyle, co nic, choć czasami zabłąkana kula potrafi wylądować w czole przeciwnika. To również się nie zmieniło.

Do rozgrywki powróciło ""skanowanie"". Kto grał w CS 1.6, ten wie, jak częstym obrazkiem były osoby strzelające po ścianach, by trafić stojącego za nimi wroga. Opcja była dostępna tylko w niektórych miejscach, bo inaczej zabawa nie miałaby najmniejszego sensu. W Source z tego zrezygnowano, ale w Global Offensive znów możemy marnować amunicję i walić w beton, a nuż kogoś trafimy, co dodatkowo zostanie wynagrodzone specjalnym symbolem. Tu jednak kończą się zabawy z fizyką, o ile tak można to nazwać, bo Valve wprowadziło jedno, dość irytujące ograniczenie. Pamiętacie przewracanie biurowych szafek czy przestawianie krzesełek na Office w celu zablokowania przejścia antyterrorystom? A może kojarzycie latające beczki, czy inne tego typu elementy? W GO tego zwyczajnie brakuje. Wszelakie krzesła, szafki, beczki, czy automaty z wodą są twardo przytwierdzone do podłoża i nawet wybuchający obok granat nie jest w stanie wyrządzić im krzywdy. Gdzieniegdzie zrzucimy ze ściany jakiś telewizor czy rozwalimy leżące na stoisku owoce, ale interakcję z otoczeniem ograniczono do minimum. Ciekawi mnie czy to celowy krok Valve, czy może wynika on z jakichś technicznych niezgodności.
Strzela się natomiast bardzo przyjemnie. Grając miałem odczucie, że studio przy tworzeniu fizyki strzałów wzięło kod z Left 4 Dead, Team Fortress i Counter-Strike 1.6, całość wrzuciło do jednego worka i mocno wymieszało. W efekcie tego powstał dość unikatowy system prucia ołowiem, któremu jest całkiem blisko do ostatniej z wymienionych wcześniej gier, a jednocześnie cechuje go świeżość, przez co musimy uczyć się oddawania strzałów niemalże od podstaw. Początki, jak to w „CeEsie”, są trudne, ale na chwilę obecną wymiataczy zbyt wielu na serwerach nie ma, więc edukacja przebiega w miarę bezboleśnie. Co więcej, nieco mniej osób decyduje się na zabawę ze słynną AWP w dłoni. Być może wynika to z tego, że Valve nieco utrudniło strzelanie z tej potężnej snajperki. Rozchodzi się bowiem o to, że w w trakcie celowania przez lunetę, przy poruszeniu postacią, obraz na chwilę się zamazuje i dopiero stanięcie na baczność daje upragnioną stabilizację. Przeładowywanie karabinu poprzez szybką zmianę trzymanej w dłoni broni zostało jednak bez zmian i w sumie dobrze, bo brak tej opcji zniszczyłby jedną z cech charakterystycznych serii.
Zmodyfikowano za to celownik. Klasyczne cztery prostopadłe względem siebie kreski zastąpiono czymś dużo bardziej skomplikowanym, składającym się z kilku ruchomych elementów, zmieniających położenie w zależności od ruchu czy pozycji, w której się znajdujemy. Nic nie stoi jednak na przeszkodzie by wrócić do bardziej archaicznego rozwiązania. Zabrakło zaś możliwości personalizacji menu służącego do nabywania ekwipunku, które przeszło gruntowny remont. Dość mało efektowne belki znane z poprzednich części wyewoluowały na podzielony na różne kategorie okrąg, który pewnie całkiem łatwo będzie się obsługiwać posiadaczom konsol. Na PC już tak wygodne to nie jest, choć po pewnym czasie idzie się przyzwyczaić, a do tego autorzy pozostawili możliwość szybkich zakupów przy użyciu klawiatury, więc de facto nowe rozwiązanie nie jest złe.

Ciekawą nowością są zmiany w arsenale. Do składu broni dołączyły nowe rodzaje granatów, a wśród nich koktajl Mołotowa i Wabik. Ten pierwszy znajduje zastosowanie dość często i dodaje do rozgrywki garść taktyki. Możemy przy jego pomocy zablokować przejście przeciwnikowi, rzucając mu pod nogi płonącą niespodziankę. Naturalnie może on spróbować przejść po rozżarzonej ścieżce, ale ta odbierze mu sporą cześć punktów życia i spowolni jego ruchy. Kilka razy udało mi się tak uratować bombsite, gdy siedziałem na nim sam, a w tunelu zauważyłem wybiegających terrorystów. Szybko zagrodziłem im drogę ogniem, co dało mi kilka cennych sekund na poinformowanie kolegów z drużyny, żeby możliwie jak najszybciej pospieszyli mi z pomocą. Mało kto decyduje się bowiem na stąpanie po ogniu. Wabik, jak sama nazwa wskazuje, służy do zwabienia przeciwnika, symulując odgłosy wystrzałów. Wydaje się to być ciekawym rozwiązaniem, ale w praktyce mało kto daje się na takie oszustwo nabrać.

1347,"[h1] For Those Who Wants To Learn Seriously[/h1]

  First of all, the game respects to the original Counter-Strike soul. What I mean with that; Close combats, mid-range combats, long combats, auido, personolized CFG, grenade training, team-work, using communications are still have great affects on the gameplay. 

  So far what has changed? First, graphics and phsycs has changed. Weapons has changed, community has changed, players has changed, match-making has changed. I will explain everything what i mean by those but first things first. For old players from the times of 1.5 or 1.6 (or even older) You may difficulties adapting to phsyscs and new gameplay. As I said players has changed, and the teamwork has changed. There will be a lots of people telling you what to do. Why are you flashing, why did you smoke there, how didn't you heard the defuse but believe me you will understand that all after a few hours on the game. With the new ranking system ( I will explain this furter too.) there is much at stake. Your efforts and skills will affect you teammates ranks in competitive mode.

  Let's start to explain; 
[b]Matchmakin Mode (Competitive)[/b]
5 to 5 serious matchs, instead of an 32 player 16-16 server which people often go crazy run around, rushing CT's. You will experience a real clan match. For example, after you accept the game on Dust 2 if you leave the game you will have a punishment for 30 minutes, 1 hour, 2 hours, 24 hours, 2 days, 7 days. Same punishments for killing to much teammates or killing a teammate after the spawn. 

  After you have won 10 games in competitive mode you can see your rank.(Search google for further reading.) Ranking system is a revoulitoun for me. Like in chess you will face with opponents in your same skill level and that also offers a chalenge: To up rank but also there is a risk to de-rank. Ranking system works on different ways and have a lots of different derrivatives. For example winning matches while the opponents have higher ranks then you or having a 37-5 K/D. Believe me ranking system is your friend

[b]Weapons[/b]
Remeber the times that AK-47, M4A1, AWP, Desert Eagle were over power? Forget it and also say goodbye to a lots of weapons including MP-5 (one of my favs.) Goodbye to scout... 

Say hello to PP-Bizon, SSG,P250,Nova...

With these changes you'll have a very expanded area of weapons to chose, MAG-7 is op in close combat, SSG has its pluses such as you can shoot straight while jumping. five-seven has a great armor penetration CZ-75 is an automatic pistol that you can rush with in an eco round. The reason im telling you all these because you can choose your own weapons considering you style. Are you a rusher? Get your P90 ready 50 bullets, low recoil high fire rate, you are a close-holder, get a mag-7, you are good on sniping and pistols? get your ssg. Options are much better then it was in 1.6 or else.

Also do not omit the skins and market. over 100 skins for weapons, 10 different weapon boxes near 30 different collections. Trade up contract, keys, operation bravo-phoenix. Thats not something that I can explain. You need to see it yourself and feel the difference. 

Audios are better, community updates every second, you can report cheaters, phsycs are nearly awesome then every other fps games. (yes including CoD). 

Go and get the game, do not wait for price to go down. You can make that money in game with selling weapons on the market for the time being.  

14.99$ for this game is like paying 40.000$ for a masseratti. (And masseratti doesnt helps you to make your money back.)

Trust me if you are searching for a great fps experience, this is the most exciting game for time being.

1352,"Death is a great teacher. Failure in Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is, as it always has been for this series, the greatest way to learn where you should have gone, what you shouldn't have done, and how you could have done better. Counter-Strike players spend a lot of time learning -- consequently, they are always getting better.

     Growth is an important factor in Global Offensive, especially if you're coming into Counter-Strike fresh or after a sabbatical. This is an extremely hardcore, skill-based first-person shooter, and it forces you to think differently than other modern shooters. If you’re a Call of Duty player, you’re going to need to change your play style to succeed here. Counter-Strike also tries developing into something new here as well, despite doing little to push itself beyond what it’s always done best. Global Offensive modifies old maps to keep veterans on their toes, and introduces official new modes that encourage different play styles for the first time in almost 15 years.

     For the uninitiated, Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is a small-scale, team-based first-person shooter with permanent death. When a counter-terrorist kills a terrorist planting explosives in a classic Defusal match, or a CT escort swallows a sniper round in Hostage Rescue, the victim is dead for good and doesn't respawn until the next round. As such, players on both sides must exercise skill and care. The bomb objective, meanwhile, gives everyone a purpose. Of course matches end when everyone on a team is dead, but a clever and coordinated terrorist team will give the CTs the slip, plant their bomb, and protect the bomb site. Between rounds, everyone spends earned cash on better gear and guns, and the cycle continues.

     Pieces of the Counter-Strike formula are dated at this point, but the superb heart and soul of Global Offensive is timeless. Teams are small, guns are lethal, and rounds are short. There's an addictive just-one-more-round quality to it, because there's a constant desire to do better than last time, to earn a satisfying kill, or to win in a new way. Call of Duty and Battlefield vets will wonder why they can't sprint to escape enemy fire or look down the iron sights to improve aim; Counter-Strike players will feel like they walked into their redecorated home. Certain map redesigns will catch hardcore fans off guard, but the changes are for the best -- the underpass choke point in de_dust, for instance, has a new escape route.

     Even in the face of genre evolution, Global Offensive doesn’t care to adapt. CSGO is so dedicated to Counter-Strike's aging ideals despite market and trend changes that it brute-forces its way to success. Part of what makes it such an engaging competitive game is that killing in Global Offensive requires a wholly different skill set than other shooters. Everyone is limited to what they have and can see, with little room for character modification or on-the-fly advantages. Running and gunning is a useless play style, even if you've bought a helmet and kevlar that round, to the point that someone standing still is more likely to score the kill. Walking, crouching, or standing are your best bets to reduce the inaccurate spray of machine-gun fire.

     Consequently, killing in Global Offensive feels good. There's a sickening sensation to dropping someone dead because you know they're not coming back. It's also satisfying knowing you used limited resources to play smarter than your victim. If players aren't watching corners, providing covering fire, or using smoke grenades and flashbangs, they're more likely to take a headshot from a more delicate and patient triggerman. The desire to experience that distinct feeling is a strong motivator to keep playing, even when you're getting steamrolled by an obviously better team.

     If you've played Counter-Strike before, Global Offensive probably sounds a whole lot like Counter-Strike. Like Counter-Strike: Source before it, Global Offensive exists simply to modernize the look of the classic competitive shooter, while doing little to disrupt the core form and function. At the same time, it does enough to color outside the lines of tradition to justify your time and effort.

     Fire is one of the most interesting new combat variables. Molotov cocktails and incendiary grenades either roast groups of guys or force them in another direction. Flames are a useful distraction or scare tactic, too. They're particularly useful during Demolition matches, which focus the fight at a single bomb site rather than giving terrorists two to pick between. The new and modified maps in this mode aren't as big as classic Counter-Strike arenas – entire sections have been cut off to direct teams toward a central location – but their thoughtful design is as intricate as ever. The Lake map is a standout -- there's a wide open yet densely populated yard around the bomb site, which is inside a sizable lakeside home with plenty of vantage points and hiding spots. To separate Demolition from Defusal, players can't buy between rounds. Instead, it takes a cue from the other new mode, Arms Race, in which each kill unlocks another weapon instantly. The better you do, the more you have to switch up the way you play, and because Demolition is so fast you'll need to be quick on your feet.

     Unlike other game types, Arms Race allows for respawns. It's the most chaotic and care-free mode in Global Offensive, with players throwing caution to the wind for the sake of climbing the kill ladder as quickly as possible. It's a shame there are only two maps in Arms Race -- a problem that will more likely persist on consoles than PC.

     If you have the option, playing the PC version is unquestionably the best way to experience Counter-Strike: Global Offensive. Mods, mouse and keyboard, and the usual PC-only options are better than the ports. Plus, Valve is much better about long-term PC support -- it abandoned Team Fortress 2 on consoles, and Portal 2's level editor was PC exclusive. If you prefer to play on consoles, Global Offensive is the same great game",True

So many things I want to talk about:

GAMEPLAY
This is alot like Counter Strike 1.6 and has so many unique features I enjoy. I'm glad this game didn't come out like Counter Strike: Source which was terrible. This game has intense sound effects that play when the bomb is planted, at the beginning/end of rounds, when you win/lose, and when you get an mvp. The guns and their spray patterns are fun to learn and take alot of time and skill to master which is good (not a cod fan). Like all Source games you can change crosshair, sound settings, video settings, and tons more through the console. The guns feel exciting to hold and shoot. Everytime I pick up an AK47 I feel fireworks going off in my head. This game gets very intense and based on teamwork. If you do not have someone to play I recommend finding someone to play with since alot of people in competitive play aren't always nice.

COMMUNITY
The community of Counter Strike is amazing. There still is that 40% of people that like to mess with people and hate just like any other community, but CSGO's community has many coders and other people trying to help VALVE locate bugs and exploits in CSGO which is awesome! They are helping make a better game. CSGO's community also has very talented artists who do skins for the game. Some of the amazing skins to make it in have been the Hyperbeast, Cyrex, Neon Rider, Asiimov, and more! Alot of people love Counter Strike and so many new gaming networks/sub communities have started through Counter Strike. The community also has fun gambling websites where you can gamble skins away on pro games.

RANKS
This is a very important part of the game that has been ruined by multiple vac wave bans. After all these people were banned from CSGO everyone started ranking up 2-3 ranks. Most people in their rank should be about 3 ranks lower. Valve needs to fix this! They need to go through and set everyones ranks to unranked, then let people play 5 games to determine their new rank or something. Hopefully one day the horrible rank issue will be fixed.

VAC
The Valve Anti-Cheat detection on CSGO hacks is terrible. ESEA Client has a better hack detection then Valve. Valve needs to fix this right away!!! There are too many hackers in the higher ranks. Most hacks aren't detected until people finally report somebody and they go to overwatch.",True

1367,"I thank TrulyRazor for buying this for me a long time ago -- I insisted to him that I would not play it. Seems I was wrong.

Most around me have always known me for, perhaps not absolutely hating, but at the very least showing some amount of contempt and disdain for all things Counter-Strike. I should address this before talking about why the game has value.

 One component of my dislike was cured by playing it, as I knew it would. I simply did not understand the game, most of the mechanics seemed counter-intuitive and frustrating. This changed as I played and came to understand the game -- I expected that.

The other element of my dislike for Counter-Strike in general has remained unchanged. The elitism of its players and the toxic, cancerous nature of the community itself.

 The elitism comes in the form of treating Counter-Strike as if it were above other shooters that do not aim to do what it does.

 Call of Duty, with its fun, arcade shooting must be seen as garbage, and Halo with its slower-paced shooting with sci-fi shields/weapons/tech must also be bad, for it is different. Battlefield too, not having recoil patterns that take months to completely memorize, is clearly for the trash heap. Inane comments like these come from a simple ignorance about different things serving different purposes, but it is obnoxious nonetheless.

The cancerous community is really just that, cancerous. Many talk of Russians in silver matchmaking, I have not encountered this.

 I have however, encountered toxic, alpha-male types who yell, complain, and belittle others -- who put down their teammates, make them feel like crap, etc. I have encountered all possible types of cringy weeaboos, bronies, and people who recite old memes in deathmatch lobbies and think they're funny. People who make the lamest, overused jokes and think it's hilarious, people who just scream and make noises for shock value. Standard fare for most online shooters but CSGO has a LOT of this.

So, yeah, this game has one of the worst communities out there. It's true. It doesn't, however, make the game wholly bad.

On to why the game is good.

The game does have a very steep learning curve. Slowly coming to understand the way the game works, the importance of each part is satisfying. As you learn positioning, grenade throws, crosshair placement, recoil patterns, and so on you can feel yourself getting better at the game.

 Not trying very hard and not understanding either immediately ranked me at Silver III when I started. The slow process of getting better and rising through the ranks is immensely satisfying and enjoyable -- I'm now Legendary Eagle (SMFC now). It taught me a lot of patience and willingness to push on even when frustrated. 

While most of the maps are CT-sided, they are all designed with a great deal of balance in mind. The weapons too, their costs, their recoil, each having drawbacks, give balance to the game.

All the elements combined -- the economy, the guns, the maps, positioning, timing, recoil, grenade throws, sound, etc -- and you get a very tense, balanced shooter.

 There are very few situations where it could not go either way -- if skill levels are equal, I am not claiming silvers have much chance against high-level smurfs. Speaking generally, equally matched players in an average game have an equal chance to win and things can quickly turn around for the whole game  or for any single round if one smart player knows what's going on.

I know it's easy to be cynical about bad teammates or people who don't listen, but that's not really got to do with the quality of the game, I'm simply talking about how it should play out ideally.

A good game of Counter-Strike in its ideal form is something highly enjoyable -- when teammates are listening, when plays work, when headshots connect, when the other team stands at least some chance, then the game is fantastic to play. 

It is highly demanding of you, asking disciplined patience, focus, and consistency, but also highly satisfying, granting deserved victory, ranking up, and greater confidence as you become better. There are few other games like it, or that at least, provide a similar experience.

I would recommend you play with friends, granted that you have friends you can trust to listen to you, take feedback, and try hard enough to improve with you.

 Besides the fact that you'll have dependable people to play with, having others to complain about the game with, to share your losses and your gains definitely keeps you sane when the game is at its most frustrating.

 You learn about the game together, get better together, you point out eachother's flaws and learn from their strengths -- it is, again, much more enjoyable and will also allow you to tolerate the game longer, as you'll be going through the journey with others rather than alone.

It is not, honestly, a game for everyone. If you are willing to put effort into this game then you'll be rewarded. If you're a long time player and go into it every day understanding you still have a lot more to learn and discover, then again, you'll be rewarded. (I have found though that, going into ANYTHING with a renewed sense of wonder and willingness to learn grants a better experience.)

I recommend this game for any and all who can put in the effort, change their play, practice consistently, learn, and expect progress to come slowly. If instant gratification is your thing, don't play this.

Oh yeah, there's also the usual TF2-style item hunt for weapon skins and cases in case you're interested in wasting a lot of money -- not at all implying I am not guilty in this either.

So give the game a try, just understand what you're getting into.",True

-With the VAC system, Hackers get what they deserve
-Skill is required
-Community mods
-A special gun for everyone
-Footsteps
-Strategic in ways such as using flashes and smokes
-Easy to play and get into

Neutral
-Skins, many people will say how skins don't matter and they are 'opinional' but personally who would want to play with default skins, no one would use stock skins so Valve encourages people to 'buy' keys and gamble away their skins in uncasing and bets. I honestly don't know if this is a con or not since Valve does encourage people to put more money into skins than the game itself. 

Cons
-Hackers
-Smurfs
-People can be salty
-Debatable if some guns are OP

        [td]The competitive game mode is the main grasp of the game for me. It features close to endless enjoyment and always offers a different experience each time. The game is heavily skill based, and will require some time and effort to get better. There is plenty of guns, all with different recoil patterns. There are many maps in the game, and new ones are added during operations. There are also community maps you can play with friends as well. The other gamemodes to competitive are more casual gamemodes, but are usually not as enjoyable, due to the lack of skill groups meaning you will end up against better or worse opponents to yourself.[/td]

1421,"Counter-Strike: Global Offensive (CS: GO) expands upon the team-based action gameplay that it pioneered when it was launched 20 years ago.

I really love this game i playing since 2013 but i think Panorama update is very very bad cuze same csgo players have now low fps and its hard. but i like updates for more

CS: GO features new maps, characters, weapons, and game modes, and delivers updated versions of the classic CS content (de_dust2, de_mirage, de_cache etc.). but my favorite is (de_inferno)

""Counter-Strike took the gaming industry by surprise when the unlikely MOD became the most played online PC action game in the world almost immediately after its release in August 1999,"" said Doug Lombardi at Valve. ""For the past 12 years, it has continued to be one of the most-played games in the world, headline competitive gaming tournaments and selling over 25 million units worldwide across the franchise. CS: GO promises to expand on CS' award-winning gameplay and deliver it to gamers on the PC as well as the next gen consoles and the Mac.""",True
1422,"This review was changed for the third time so far. The first review was made when the CZ was a rifle, second review was made in 2019, and i believe the third and last review will be found all the way in the bottom  

Let's give this game an honest review.
Okay I wanna start by saying that I am a CS series Fan. I have countless hours in CS 1.6, CSCZ (LuL i know) and CSS. And from all these titles I think CSGO is the worst of them all.
I will explain my negative experience with ""Garbage GO"" by splitting this entire topic into 3 sub categories: Community, Balance, Developer Support.

Community:
The community pretty much consists of 3 main groups of people:
1. Easter European Children,
2. Normal People,
3. Cheaters.
CS never had a problem with toxic and annoying communities however it all changed when CSGO came. I mean Jesus I cant join Casual because there is a shit load of kids running around and screaming, I can't play on community servers because they are usually 64 people cancer, and competitive just doesn't cut it I mean I like it but I don't want to try hard every time I play this game.
Don't get me wrong you can find your occasional good people. But out of 10 matchmaking games 9 times you wish you never met those people.

Gun Balance:
Okay this one is good.
Gun balance doesn't really exist in this game anymore. See back then we used to have the AK, M4, AWP, MP5 and Deagle. Everything else was either situational or a miss click.... See even though these 5 guns where super good and where the only ones used they where perfectly balanced with each other. Meaning that the top tier guns where BALANCED!!!!
This is not the case in CSGO. AWP is stiff asf***!, pistols are pure PTSD!, riffles have either not enough damage or weird hit reg, and in general the gun balance considering SMG's, heavy weapons is just ........ JESUS!
Take the gun balance of CSGO, but only the gun balance don't look at the brand only the gun balance. If any other game had this type of balance it would be reviewed to DEATH! The gun balance is garbage and everyone who remotely tells me that the gun balance makes sense I just wanna say that what they are saying IS BLASPHEMY!!!!  

Developer Support: 
After the AUG being overpowered as fuck and the Revolver being a pocket AWP it is clear to see that Valve doesn't test updates like ever.... How can such a big company on one of their most sold games not test updates before they release them it is a mystery to me. 
Even after millions valve received there is no working anti cheat system, and the only good content that is being released are skins which some of them cost into the thousands when kids in Africa starve. It is disgusting!!!!

All the major tournaments, money and skins will never make this game good.
If the gun balance and Developer Support is not there this game will awlays remain MEH. I am not a little kid you can feed of with some shinny fade skins. I am very very VERY! sorry what happened with CSGO. I don't recommend this game. 
Try it out yourself and loose faith in big gaming companies.
 
2019 review >>>
Steam offered me to revise my review after additional 86 hours played on this game. The game still is taking weird turns facing the tides of time. CSGO is in one of the best situations a CS game has ever been (beside 1.6, but taking 1.6 is simply unfair towards any game in the gaming industry). Maps are constantly improved and guns are kinda balanced after a lot of mistakes done prior. The game is healthier especially after fooooorknight zapped most of the kids out of this cursed community over here. I am a casual player and my casual needs are satisfied. I have only 220 hours in this game because i have other choices, however if those other choices would have not been there id have more hours in this game. I am a CS series fan and always will be :). I follow the majors, and follow updates and changes mad. I watch CSGO related videos, and here and there i chip in 1 hour of play time either comp or casual. The game is in a waaaay better position than it was last time i gave an opinion on it. And dare i say i can recommend it. for the money you'd pay for being able to do matchmaking and stuff its alright. 


2020 >>>

The game has picked itself up from the fire. Volvo finally put some elbow grease into development and the game was luckily saved from the shambles it once found itself in. 

There are new operations dropped every now and then. Even though I'm not a friend of the season pass type of content drop concept I do not mind it as it does not keep me from enjoying all the different facets of the game. Still in 2020 we find the usual problems: hitboxes, hitreg, running ak headshots etc. However things are less annoying than before and vac actually works halfway decent nowadays. Beside that prime matchmaking does keep lobbies clean to some extend due to overwatch etc but still you will run into cheaters. With all of that being said. The game is good. The game is back because the competition almost zapped CS:GO out of gaming world. If Valve would have not tried to turn the game around the entire Valorant will be the CS:GO killer would have become the trough, Imagine a game with such a rich history being killed by an arcade anime shooter. Gun balance is normal again. Even though that still to this day the negev being 1.7k bothers me as it actually makes no sense. The game is enjoyable. Not perfect but it has gotten better thank god for fortnight because we would have still been stuck with the actual pile of garbage CS:GO was back in 2017 
",True
1423,"Before I started playing CSGO I was depressed and not motivated to do anything and I hated my job and didn't know what to do in my life.

But this game has totally changed my mind and opened a new chapter to my life. Finally I found something that I am good and helps me to reduce stress.

However, this have become an addiction and I can not STOP playing this game 24/7 and even got FIRED by my boss for being late and tired at work. But who CARES that job sucks anyways.

But now I have become a potatoe and jobless and still opening cases to get a knife and hoping to get a PAYDAY $$$  :)

1429,"Counter-Strike is said to be the most popular tactical team-based first-person shooter with a timeless soul. The fourth full-fledged part of this game, Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, makes old school players feel at (renovated) home. The rules are known to all yet hardly anyone knows everything and it’s obvious that devil is in the details. You can play in several modes but classic competitive deserves attention primarily. Five terrorists against five counter-terrorists in two varieties: planting/defusing bomb or detention/release of hostages. The formula is simple but not simplistic.

It’s a pity that there are many players trying to cheat. Fortunately, some of them are consistently disqualified by Valve. The most beautiful thing in this game is visible growth and major obstacle may be the first steps and initial figuring out the system and players’ behavior... There are neither unusual skills nor fancy tricks. The tools are simple - a dozen guns and other weapons like grenades as well as your ideas and tactics, which you can share with others, that actually being a must. It's gratifying that this product is still being patched and from time to time new maps are created and there are real gems among them. Well, of course it’s a chance to meet a lot of great gamers with whom you can play other productions as well.

You must be prepared to be yelled at sometimes. You may hear you don’t know how to play, that you are f**king noob with no skill. One way or another, CS:GO teaches humility and cooperation. I've never been an avid fan of this series but this game is really addictive because I am able to feel that I play better with each match. The magic progress is oozing and there is no way to measure it numerically.",True

1446,"For the uninitiated, Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is a small-scale, team-based first-person shooter with permanent death. When a counter-terrorist kills a terrorist planting explosives in a classic Defusal match, or a CT escort swallows a sniper round in Hostage Rescue, the victim is dead for good and doesn't respawn until the next round. As such, players on both sides must exercise skill and care. The bomb objective, meanwhile, gives everyone a purpose. Of course matches end when everyone on a team is dead, but a clever and coordinated terrorist team will give the CTs the slip, plant their bomb, and protect the bomb site. Between rounds, everyone spends earned cash on better gear and guns, and the cycle continues.

Pieces of the Counter-Strike formula are dated at this point, but the superb heart and soul of Global Offensive is timeless. Teams are small, guns are lethal, and rounds are short. There's an addictive just-one-more-round quality to it, because there's a constant desire to do better than last time, to earn a satisfying kill, or to win in a new way. Call of Duty and Battlefield vets will wonder why they can't sprint to escape enemy fire or look down the iron sights to improve aim; Counter-Strike players will feel like they walked into their redecorated home. Certain map redesigns will catch hardcore fans off guard, but the changes are for the best -- the underpass choke point in de_dust, for instance, has a new escape route.

Even in the face of genre evolution, Global Offensive doesn’t care to adapt. CSGO is so dedicated to Counter-Strike's aging ideals despite market and trend changes that it brute-forces its way to success. Part of what makes it such an engaging competitive game is that killing in Global Offensive requires a wholly different skill set than other shooters. Everyone is limited to what they have and can see, with little room for character modification or on-the-fly advantages. Running and gunning is a useless play style, even if you've bought a helmet and kevlar that round, to the point that someone standing still is more likely to score the kill. Walking, crouching, or standing are your best bets to reduce the inaccurate spray of machine-gun fire.

Consequently, killing in Global Offensive feels good. There's a sickening sensation to dropping someone dead because you know they're not coming back. It's also satisfying knowing you used limited resources to play smarter than your victim. If players aren't watching corners, providing covering fire, or using smoke grenades and flashbangs, they're more likely to take a headshot from a more delicate and patient triggerman. The desire to experience that distinct feeling is a strong motivator to keep playing, even when you're getting steamrolled by an obviously better team.

If you've played Counter-Strike before, Global Offensive probably sounds a whole lot like Counter-Strike. Like Counter-Strike: Source before it, Global Offensive exists simply to modernize the look of the classic competitive shooter, while doing little to disrupt the core form and function. At the same time, it does enough to color outside the lines of tradition to justify your time and effort.",True
1447,"A hard game to fap to. But if you go really fast, it'll work.",True
1448,"THE competitive FPS game. Great fun to play, although the community can be a right pain in the rear, and it suffers from its fair share of hackers. Practise will make you better, and there is a massive number of steam workshop maps and other items available for it.

1466,"Valve doesn't care about this game anymore.
So, basically we can observe growing dissatisfaction around community that does play this game in matchmaking servers. Starting from 64tr issues that itself are just really great these times (you can't really use argument that players of CS:GO don't have rigs good enough to run the game on 128TR, it's so inappropriate and fetched), or facts that toxicity is just absurdally present in games. Also the issue when the warmup ends with 4v4 on both teams, you all expect the match to be stopped and just move on towards looking for new game. Huh, it of course was to be expected 2 years ago when it happened once or twice for me. Last 2 months proved me wrong, first match that just started 3v5, today's match 4v4 (enemy player came back in like last 3 seconds before getting MM ban). Not to mention trade regulations or taxes that valve is implying on EVERY single trade (imagine cheapest skin rotating between 5 people - valve gets it's worth equal 0.04 from the transactions and the skin is still here around waiting for being sold and taxed again, despite the fact we've paid for the keys first of all, now count the amount they make from knives or gloves). I get the feeling we as community are nothing like fish in the tank, nice to look at and just feed them once for a time (whoa, like, when did the last feeding occured though). It's ridiculous that the company that makes milions from this game, could make even 10x more if only they'd care about the community and fans by listening to their requests or at least trying to listen to them. Hiring like additional 50 people to analyze the facts, providing them tools for it would be percentile of the profits it would bring, but I guess all that matters is cashing out kids and doing cs:go v2 when this one dies. I mean, I am at least partially right, when the people that care about this game more than ""sunday players"" preffer playing ESEA, FACEIT's, paying money for the features they bring instead of playing free servers of the game they BOUGHT. Feels like microtransactions ehh? I dare you don't you bring 128 paid MM servers tho coz that would be most ubisoft/ea thing you could actually do for killing yourself. :)",True

Ideally, you're gonna become better, actually you won't, but you will be sometimes carried so hard through your games that you'll manage to get to some decent ranks, where you'll get stomped because you play against people who sacrificed their girlfriends for pure reaction time and insanely inhuman skills. Talking and having fun at this stage is basically impossible, since you will have to drop down everything that might even slightly decrease your attention, e.g: Your baby, your girlfriend, the phone, the doorbell, everything. After 500 hours you'll get to the elo hell, Legendary Eagle Master, where you are gonna face off exact copies of KennyS, ApeX, olofmeister and more.

1480,"With over 2000 hours total put into this game, and still not even beginning to feel burned out. There are, however a few flaws that I'm sure will be ironed out with the frequent updates.

The game offers an immersive team-based experience that gets the heart racing at every turn. So far in my experience, there hasn't been a game that I haven't had the longing to win; most players in the game compliment the game's features in order to create an interactive title.

Internet latency, or ping, is a major issue with this title, and is what is holding it back from the ten score. Even with the small thirty ping I achieve in game, there is small rubber-banding and instances where I (and my friends) have experienced problems and been killed by an enemy simply because of the internet difference. I hope that valve will continue to try and sort out these minor bugs in the future to establish a more fair and enjoyable game than this already is.

Matchmaking times, especially in competitive are quite poor. I see that there are hundreds or thousands of people searching for the same map as I, but it still can take up to thirty minutes to find a game. If Valve cannot find a way to solve this, I would recommend adding a minimal/ recommended internet connection to have a reasonable matchmaking experience.

Despite these minor flaws, I would still very much so recommend this game to someone that enjoys a first person shooter, but might want a more competitive or professional setting.",True

1495,"I played CS 1.5 and 1.6 when I was 11 years old and I'm 25 years old now. I quit when Source came out because I thought it was lame but came back to CS:GO over a decade later. This game is what you make it. Sure, it's not as flashy as Fortnite, Rainbow Six Siege, or Apex Legends, but the simplicity of CS:GO makes it iconic. There's so much more to this game than aiming at the enemy player and I think that's where it really shines. Sure, you can have incredible aim but if your mechanics and communication are garbage, then you won't get very far in the competitive scene. The implementation of Danger Zone has been beneficial to the amount of enjoyment that I've received from playing this game. It just adds another activity that I can do while playing and it's fun to mess around with friends and relax even though my frame rate drops significantly. 

If you're going to try this game out for the first time, make sure you have a microphone. Online players can be toxic in any game, but when you meet the right people you can establish great friendships that will make you really look forward to the next time you play CS:GO. There's a lot of room for self-improvement at the game and it will take you months to notice significant results but it's worth the grind. I couldn't recommend this game any more and if you do want to try it out, add me and I'd love to show you the ropes. 

MY VIEWS HAVE CHANGED - SEE BELOW

(UPDATE 05/12/2021) 
Welp, coming on here to rant about this game because it's really been trash lately. Casuals are the same but the Competitive experience has been absolutely terrible. I have almost 4,000 hours on this game, I worked really hard to get my competitive rank of MG. Why is it that every morning I queue up to play a Competitive match and I get placed in a lobby with new, silver players who are hacking? In these last two weeks, I've lost multiple games to hackers on new accounts and it's hit the point where I had to come on here and say something. Valve you need to do something with your anti-cheat because it's clearly not working fast enough. This morning I had a teammate who before the game even started was complaining on voice chat about two enemies who were blatantly cheating the previous game. They were incredibly toxic, talking trash in chat since the game started. After 3 rounds of our game, they began spinning, using anti-aim, headshotting everyone through walls with AWPs. Is this the type of game you want, Valve? You have a loyal fan base who devote so much time into practicing to get better and competing just to have it all ruined because you can't figure out how to deal with this issue. This is a gross level of incompetence and I'm honestly thinking about switching over to Valorant or another competitive shooter just because the hacking is ruining this game for me. You clearly don't give a rat's ass about the community that keeps this game afloat but are quick to put out cash-grab crates to have your underaged players gamble their parent's money away in hopes of getting something good. Really setting a good example with this dog shit philosophy you have going on.",True

1498,"If you can manage to get past the idea of russian and turkish kids spamming their microphones and trolling in every competitive match, Cs:GO is actually a good game. I won't go into details as I think everybody has heard of the Counter Strike franchise, and if you played the previous games or even if you are a new player, this game is the perfect place for veterans and beginners alike, as the ranking system is really good compared to the other online games out there (of course you'll get your daily dose of ""I am silver but play like a global elite"" players, but don't hate on the game, hate on the toxic parts of its community). It is a well-priced shooter for the countless hours you are probably going to spend playing it. My only complaint would be the importance players think skins have (yes, they are beautiful, but they are damn useless), problem that spawns a new species of player: the one who bought Cs:GO only to open cases and brag to his friends about what skins he got,literally not even playing the game, only marketing skins.

1503,"Easily one of the greatest FPS in the history of video games, and I absolutely love this game. CS is easy to learn but hard to master. Once you get into it and learn the basics, you can't stop playing it. This game is a masterpiece.
The skill-based matchmaking system isn’t perfect, but it does work, and it pairs you with players with similar skill levels to yourself. While in the lower Silver-ranks you will still meet the inevitable trolls, cheaters and the occasional smurf, you’ll usually end up in a game with people that are of similar skill to you.
If you're just getting into the game, I'd highly recommend you to buy prime because non-prime is now unplayable, it's filled with cheaters and smurfs who will just ruin your experience. Now that the game is free, cheaters get banned and it literally takes them two minutes to create a new account.
In the game, you'll come across all types of people. Some will be friendly and some will be toxic. Once you get good, you'll eventually be called a cheater because every CS player gets called a cheater at some point. People may report you, but just take it as a compliment.

Greatest FPS game in my opinion. You don't need a powerful rig for this game, an average one will do just fine. 10/10 Highly Recommended. Just know that this game is full of cheaters, especially non-prime. There are cheaters in prime but quite low in comparison with non-prime.",True

 cs:go is basically the best teamplay shooter. Devs support the game and make it better every month. Cybersport exists so the opportunity of being paid just for playing exists. The game is popular so you can use it to become popular on twitch, youtube or whatever platform you choose to use.

In sixth grade, I would wake up for school at 5:30 AM, but then I started getting up at 4:30 just to get a couple rounds in before class. Call it dedication or a sickening obsession, but I was hooked on CS (nevermind my neighbor who broke into my house to play while I slept!) It was more than a game. It was my social hub, my iTunes visualizer, and my brief entryway into game design (which didn’t go very far.) It is and remains a standout multiplayer shooter that paved the way for things to come with Call of Duty and Battlefield.

Being eight years since the excellent Source remake, Valve has decided it’s time to give the game another facelift. What started as a Source port for consoles became a more ambitious project that included PC. While there are no radical departures in Global Offensive, it is without a doubt a reboot. Valve has just hit the reset button on the series, once again. As drastic and premature of a maneuver it may be, there is no denying that Counter-Strike remains an addictive and rewarding competitive shooter like no other.",True

1522,"Death is a great teacher. Failure in Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is, as it always has been for this series, the greatest way to learn where you should have gone, what you shouldn't have done, and how you could have done better. Counter-Strike players spend a lot of time learning -- consequently, they are always getting better.

Growth is an important factor in Global Offensive, especially if you're coming into Counter-Strike fresh or after a sabbatical. This is an extremely hardcore, skill-based first-person shooter, and it forces you to think differently than other modern shooters. If you’re a Call of Duty player, you’re going to need to change your play style to succeed here. Counter-Strike also tries developing into something new here as well, despite doing little to push itself beyond what it’s always done best. Global Offensive modifies old maps to keep veterans on their toes, and introduces official new modes that encourage different play styles for the first time in almost 15 years.

For the uninitiated, Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is a small-scale, team-based first-person shooter with permanent death. When a counter-terrorist kills a terrorist planting explosives in a classic Defusal match, or a CT escort swallows a sniper round in Hostage Rescue, the victim is dead for good and doesn't respawn until the next round. As such, players on both sides must exercise skill and care. The bomb objective, meanwhile, gives everyone a purpose. Of course matches end when everyone on a team is dead, but a clever and coordinated terrorist team will give the CTs the slip, plant their bomb, and protect the bomb site. Between rounds, everyone spends earned cash on better gear and guns, and the cycle continues.

Pieces of the Counter-Strike formula are dated at this point, but the superb heart and soul of Global Offensive is timeless. Teams are small, guns are lethal, and rounds are short. There's an addictive just-one-more-round quality to it, because there's a constant desire to do better than last time, to earn a satisfying kill, or to win in a new way. Call of Duty and Battlefield vets will wonder why they can't sprint to escape enemy fire or look down the iron sights to improve aim; Counter-Strike players will feel like they walked into their redecorated home. Certain map redesigns will catch hardcore fans off guard, but the changes are for the best -- the underpass choke point in de_dust, for instance, has a new escape route.

Even in the face of genre evolution, Global Offensive doesn’t care to adapt. CSGO is so dedicated to Counter-Strike's aging ideals despite market and trend changes that it brute-forces its way to success. Part of what makes it such an engaging competitive game is that killing in Global Offensive requires a wholly different skill set than other shooters. Everyone is limited to what they have and can see, with little room for character modification or on-the-fly advantages. Running and gunning is a useless play style, even if you've bought a helmet and kevlar that round, to the point that someone standing still is more likely to score the kill. Walking, crouching, or standing are your best bets to reduce the inaccurate spray of machine-gun fire

Consequently, killing in Global Offensive feels good. There's a sickening sensation to dropping someone dead because you know they're not coming back. It's also satisfying knowing you used limited resources to play smarter than your victim. If players aren't watching corners, providing covering fire, or using smoke grenades and flashbangs, they're more likely to take a headshot from a more delicate and patient triggerman. The desire to experience that distinct feeling is a strong motivator to keep playing, even when you're getting steamrolled by an obviously better team.

If you've played Counter-Strike before, Global Offensive probably sounds a whole lot like Counter-Strike. Like Counter-Strike: Source before it, Global Offensive exists simply to modernize the look of the classic competitive shooter, while doing little to disrupt the core form and function. At the same time, it does enough to color outside the lines of tradition to justify your time and effort.

Fire is one of the most interesting new combat variables. Molotov cocktails and incendiary grenades either roast groups of guys or force them in another direction. Flames are a useful distraction or scare tactic, too. They're particularly useful during Demolition matches, which focus the fight at a single bomb site rather than giving terrorists two to pick between. The new and modified maps in this mode aren't as big as classic Counter-Strike arenas – entire sections have been cut off to direct teams toward a central location – but their thoughtful design is as intricate as ever. The Lake map is a standout -- there's a wide open yet densely populated yard around the bomb site, which is inside a sizable lakeside home with plenty of vantage points and hiding spots. To separate Demolition from Defusal, players can't buy between rounds. Instead, it takes a cue from the other new mode, Arms Race, in which each kill unlocks another weapon instantly. The better you do, the more you have to switch up the way you play, and because Demolition is so fast you'll need to be quick on your feet.",True

1524,good game,True
1525,"Ah Counter-Strike. What a wild mistress you are. At times you are loving and caring, offering great joy and hope. Then other times you are mad at me for reasons I do not understand and you cast me out; alone and unloved. 

First off, let me quickly say that the game mechanics are great. Every gun handles differently and you have to learn each one. It takes skill and practice and makes the game so much more rewarding. As a side note however, it's a bit irritating when you can only see a guys head (i.e, the gun is hidden behind a wall or something) and they can still shoot you. But I digress!

So in this game you have a few different modes that you can play, and each one has a very different play style. For instance, in Arms Race, there is no time to be subtle. You need to get 27 kills before the next guy, and you have to do this with every weapon in the game. As soon as you kill someone, your weapon switches out. This can be annoying if you're fighting several people at once, but the game is so fast paced that it really doesn't matter if you die. Instantly respawn and rush back into the field. The speed of this game makes it great for some community banter. You play in a team, but as you are really only playing for yourself, it doesn't matter if your team are doing well or not. I'll come back to this point about teams later.

Team Deathmatch is a fairly standard affair if you are familiar with any other FPS game. People spawn in and you have to kill them before they kill you. Simples! As this game mode is slower than Arms Race, you can afford to be a bit more patient. There is a timer instead of a ""reach this many points/kills."" Also, every now and then a bonus weapon appears, in which you'll get more points if you kill people with that. Respawn with this weapon and kill people within the time limit and you'll bag yourself some extra points. Person with the most points at the end wins. Again, this is a mostly light hearted game mode, and the community really shines through.

Next up is Demolition, my least favourite mode. It is much the same as the casual/competitive maps in which you have to try and plant a bomb, but the maps are smaller. The main difference in this game mode is you don't get to choose your gun. You start with a weapon and then when you kill someone in a round you change weapon at the start of the next round. Kill several people and you will be awarded with some grenades as well. The reason I dislike this mode is people can get out of sync with the weapons. If you do really well for several rounds, likelihood is you will now be on a weaker gun, or a gun you cannot personally use well. While it's good to get practice in, the realisation is that the other team can simply be on better weapons, leaving you at a major disadvantage. Again, after a few rounds they may be on a gun that they can't use and it levels the playing field again, but those few rounds can really be an irritant. 

 Now we are onto the meat and two veg. The bit the mistress both loves and despises. Competitive. In my time playing CS I have went from an absolutely horrendous player, having never really played many FPS's, to a fairly competent player. Over the space of a few months I went from unranked up to Master Guardian 1. I felt very proud of myself. However, the journey was not plain sailing. When entering a competitive mode, if you are not searching with friends, you can end up with wildly different experiences. This is where the community behind CS can really fall apart.
In a match with strangers you can have a great match with excellent communication (which is really needed in competitive) or have really bad communication and a lot of name calling. If you make a mistake, sometimes you will be supported with a lot of ""Unlucky, we'll get them next time!"" or you will receive something along the lines of ""OMG, YOU SUCK, NOOB, FFS, UNINSTALL."" This is particularly true if you're the last one left alive and all eyes are watching you. This isn't just from your team however. I have had games where I have had great communication with the opposition, and everything has been really friendly, but well fought. Othertimes however, they are raging across the keyboard at you. Yes, you can mute players, and often you may have to mute the opposition, but it is quite another to mute your team. As I said, communication is really important in a competitive match. Even if they are only yelling obscenities at you, they may occasionally have insight into where a player is. A main problem for this is it doesn't even matter if you are winning or losing. Your team could just be massively unhelpful. 
I have had a lot of fun playing competitive matches, however as time goes on it is becoming less and less fun. This could be because of all the steam sales, with people buying the game and jumping on just to be irritating. Maybe they had been banned previously and have made new accounts or some such thing. It just doesn't make for pleasant gaming however. I don't play games to become annoyed and irritated. I play them as a release. There is nothing more satisfying than doing something well. I remember playing a game on inferno as the terrorist and I had went up B. I was to push up and give them a fright while my team was to go up A. As I went up Banana, two guys came down to me. I headshotted them both. It was then that my team were shouting down the headsets. They had lost the bomb at top of middle. Only one team member had survived. He went to try and get the bomb and was instantly killed. I was on my own with 3 opponents left. I turned back round at banana and went up middle. Two were coming towards me and I take them out. Sadly, I was down to 12 health now, and the clock was ticking. I knew that the last guy was up on the left at top of middle. So I went through appartments silently. As luck would have it, a team mate of mine had a smoke grenade that had dropped there. I threw the smoke into top of middle and as it burst out I went for the bomb, with 30 seconds left to plant. The final enemy started spraying into the smoke and I knew where he was. I shot once and killed him, acing the round (or kill every enemey yourself). I've had aces before, but that one was special. My teammates errupted with cheers, as that was a very important round for us. Had we lost we would have had to eco (which is to not buy so you can save some money). It was those cheers and the great support that my team gave me that makes me love this game. The community can be incredible.

A quick note about casual is that it is pretty much identical to competitive, except with more players and thus less strategy and communication. Instead of only talking to your team, you are often talking to everyone in the game. The same issues with the community stand however. Sometimes they do a ""clutch or kick"" where the last surviving member of a team has to kill all the surviving members of the other team and win the round. This can be damn near impossible if your team didn't manage to do anything. This is often said when it's 5v1 or over. Often the community doesn't really kick the person, but I have seen it happen. I have also seen someone clutch a 6v1 and then got kicked regardless. So it's a bit of a hit and miss.

Overall, I would highly recommend this game. The mechanics are solid and the community as a whole is really great. The support people give is wonderful. Often there is great banter to be had in the non-ranked matches. Sometimes banter can come into the ranked matches, but more and more of late it has just been abuse.

1540,"full of cheaters...
EDIT: After all this years since the original review, I have to say that there aren't as many cheaters as before, that means, after this update, or even before, (which I totally don't really like it/approve it since it's just literally another way for Valve to get money and ruining the experience for many users without bad intentions, for example, after the update, if someone was almost leveling up to level 21 and getting prime, they wouldn't get it, and would have to pay in order to be able to get levels and ranks), the quantity of cheaters have decreased since there are no way to get ranks and levels without having to pay for prime.
Concluding, I actually recommend the game at this time, since your game experience won't be ruined for cheaters, like before. (FYI, before, (like 1/2 years ago) in every 5 competitive matches you would play, in all the matches you would find a cheater, usually a beyblade.)
Even without prime, you can do whatever you used to (if you played before), for example, play competitive and all other games, but you won't be in the same lobbies as the prime users, unless they select to play competitive without being able to get ranks.
Hope this clarifies your doubts about the game after the new update.",True

1544,"This is an extremely mixed and short review.

I think the game has cool and original gameplay. Though it doesn't highly innovate, it stills maintains the Counter-Strike gameplay that has been going on for about 15 years. 

Let's talk about the community. About 5% of the people you meet on Global Offensive are really nice people. 95% think they're MLG cunts and WILL kick you if you're not very good. I've been kicked multiple times and it feels awful, to think that people don't want you on your team. Makes my stomach drop to the bottomless pit.

Seriously, beware of the abysmal community and stick with your friends. If you work together with your friends to prevent the opposing team from winning, you'll have a much better time than you would being John Rambo.

But now I'm going to say this is an amazing game and I totally recommend playing it if you like competetive, slow-paced games then play with a group of friends, you'll have fun.

1552,"Counter-Strike has been around for over a decade now. Starting as a popular Half-Life mod, over the course of 15 years we now have Counter-Strike: Global Offensive also known as CSGO. Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is a small-scale, 5vs5 team-based first-person shooter with permanent death. When a counter-terrorist kills a terrorist planting explosives in a classic Defusal match, or a CT escort swallows a sniper round in Hostage Rescue, the victim is dead for good and doesn't respawn until the next round. Of course matches end when everyone on a team is dead, but a clever and coordinated terrorist team will give the CTs the slip, plant their bomb, and protect the bomb site from Counter-Terrorists defusing whilst the timer counts down. Between rounds, everyone spends earned cash on better gear and guns, and the cycle continues.   This is a hardcore skill based first person shooter. As this game if permanent death until next game it forces players to change their play style and adapt cautiously to succeed.

“[i]Death is a great teacher. Failure in Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is, as it always has been for this series, the greatest way to learn where you should have gone, what you shouldn't have done, and how you could have done better.[/i]” -IGN

Counter-Strike has a huge competitive value with approximately 1.5million people watching ESL One Cologne last month(2015). There is a huge sense of 'it's me or him' when you engage an enemy with the no respawn aspect in this game. You have one chance to kill an enemy, one chance to plant or defuse the bomb, one chance to win the round. This game really relys on your skill precision care and team tactics, along with needing a fast reaction time and a decent trigger finger, this makes you feel as you have earned each and every perfect head shot and deserved every death. Players who rely on modern game conventions such as iron sights and sprint will spent some time getting used to limit resources in CSGO: a gun, a knife, maybe some grenades... The ranking system in CSGO is a strong motivator to keep playing with very few players achieving the highest rank and staying up there. This works along other motivators such as cosmetics gun skins and achievements.

The presentation of CSGO is simple, there is little sound and visual flair allowing you to focus on the game and listen to footsteps. The graphics aren't the best either, they are beginning to show their age, however this allows players with not so good PC specs to play the game to its full and many say game play is more important than graphics. Sounds in this game are very specific and useful, a veteran would be able to tell exactly which gun is is being fired across the map just by listening whether its a sniper or a sub machine gun. On the competitive side of CSGO all players will be listening out for footsteps to help them find out where an enemy is approaching from. The game play in CSGO is what really scores it high as it if unique from most over shooters and it demands intelligent, hardcore, tactical play from every last one of its players. Along with this, the lasting appeal and replayability are very high as you always strive to get the highest rank and achievements in multiplayer competitive.

To conclude I would score CSGO a 9 out of 10. This game is very competitive and addictive. With an average of 8 million unique players every month the community won't die down any time soon. This is a demanding, skill-based multiplayer game that's as satisfying now as it ever was, but it's for a specific kind of player. If you're not willing to learn to play different than you're used to, look elsewhere. Otherwise, this is a top-tier tactics game that will probably share the long-tailed legacy of its predecessors.",True
1553,"Global Offensive is a new addition to the Counter Strike series. 
This game features a unique tactical gameplay with 2 teams.
-The Counter Terrorists (CT's): Anti - Terrorist group from over the world. SAS, SWAT, FBI and the Israel Defense Force. Their objective is to rescue hostages in (cs_) maps or in (de_) maps to defend a bombsite from the terrorists.
- The Terrorists (T's): Terrorists are the bad guys. They need to defend hostages from being rescued from the CT's or need to bomb bombsites that the CT's must defend.

Ofcourse this Counter Strike feature new and the classic maps like de_nuke and one of the best maps : de_dust2 and also features new gamemodes like: 
-Arms Race an official version of one of the most populair mod gun game. Where people need to make kills with all weapons given. The first one to get a kill with the ""golden knife"" wins
-Demolition a all new gamemode with elements of Arms Race within small demolition maps where T's need to bomb the bombsite.
-Deathmatch a deathmatch on Counter Strike maps with the idea of the chaos from game like Quake 3.

This game is for everyone. From Counter Strike veterans to people that are new to FPS's altough it can be hard to get started.

In my opinion the best thing they added to Counter Strike is the Competetive modes. Counter Strike always was one of the most competetive games ever but you needed to find matches and a team on chatrooms like IRC, Quakenet and those sort of things. Now it doesnt matter if you have a full team or your on your one. You can always find matches like this. This is just the normal Counter Strike maps. But the gameplay changes drastically. This is a dead serious mode so this is not somewhere where you should grief or fuck around. This is a COMPETETIVE mode. People want to COMPETE. Prepare for battle. However you don't need to be the best in Counter Strike to play competetive mode. After 10 wins you will be set in a skill group. To this skill group you will be matched to people with almost the same skill. So you don't have to worry.

The new Arms Deal update provided us with many new skins for you guns. This is a great addition. You can buy and or get weapons for free by playing the game.

Also new in this series is temporary map packs like the Operation Payback and the Operation Bravo. This is a mappack that you can pickup for 5 euró's that feature the most liked custom maps on official Valve servers. No lagg and your favorite maps  on stable servers.

My opinion about Global Offensive is that it is the best Counter Strike. I started playing Counter Strike Source 5 years ago. I loved the gameplay and the tactics. Then Global Offensive came out and i was tought this wasn't gonna be a good game. But it proven itself. Valve did a great job with this game. Most of the things i missed on Source are there in Global Offensive. For example the competetive mode i explained before.",True

After all it is also a game that runs on any machine!

This, Global Offensive, is proof that you do not have to release one version every year, but on the contrary, make it look like old versions with new features and technology that only Valve knows.

1563,"This version of Counter-Strike aims to unify the Counter-Strike 1.6 and Counter-Strike: Source fans into a new iteration of the classic First Person Shooter. The casual mode is, while fun most of the time, a bit lacking in meaning to any halfway serious gamer. The competitive (classic ranked matchmaking) mode is extremely competitive, with most players simply looking to rank up at any cost, or simply not rank down at worst. Hackers and smurfers run fairly rampant in competitive, and can be a large deterrent to serous legit players. The game is updated fairly often, with new operation map packs available perhaps twice a year, carrying with them the added excitement of new skins for weapons in the game.

1593,"Global Offensive is, as it always has been for this series, the greatest way to learn where you should have gone, what you shouldn't have done, and how you could have done better. Counter-Strike players spend a lot of time learning -- consequently, they are always getting better.

Growth is an important factor in Global Offensive, especially if you're coming into Counter-Strike fresh or after a sabbatical. This is an extremely hardcore, skill-based first-person shooter, and it forces you to think differently than other modern shooters. If you’re a Call of Duty player, you’re going to need to change your play style to succeed here. Counter-Strike also tries developing into something new here as well, despite doing little to push itself beyond what it’s always done best. Global Offensive modifies old maps to keep veterans on their toes, and introduces official new modes that encourage different play styles for the first time in almost 15 years For the uninitiated, Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is a small-scale, team-based first-person shooter with permanent death. When a counter-terrorist kills a terrorist planting explosives in a classic Defusal match, or a CT escort swallows a sniper round in Hostage Rescue, the victim is dead for good and doesn't respawn until the next round. As such, players on both sides must exercise skill and care. The bomb objective, meanwhile, gives everyone a purpose. Of course matches end when everyone on a team is dead, but a clever and coordinated terrorist team will give the CTs the slip, plant their bomb, and protect the bomb site. Between rounds, everyone spends earned cash on better gear and guns, and the cycle continues.

Pieces of the Counter-Strike formula are dated at this point, but the superb heart and soul of Global Offensive is timeless. Teams are small, guns are lethal, and rounds are short. There's an addictive just-one-more-round quality to it, because there's a constant desire to do better than last time, to earn a satisfying kill, or to win in a new way. Call of Duty and Battlefield vets will wonder why they can't sprint to escape enemy fire or look down the iron sights to improve aim; Counter-Strike players will feel like they walked into their redecorated home. Certain map redesigns will catch hardcore fans off guard, but the changes are for the best -- the underpass choke point in de_dust, for instance, has a new escape route.

Even in the face of genre evolution, Global Offensive doesn’t care to adapt. CSGO is so dedicated to Counter-Strike's aging ideals despite market and trend changes that it brute-forces its way to success. Part of what makes it such an engaging competitive game is that killing in Global Offensive requires a wholly different skill set than other shooters. Everyone is limited to what they have and can see, with little room for character modification or on-the-fly advantages. Running and gunning is a useless play style, even if you've bought a helmet and kevlar that round, to the point that someone standing still is more likely to score the kill. Walking, crouching, or standing are your best bets to reduce the inaccurate spray of machine-gun fire.Consequently, killing in Global Offensive feels good. There's a sickening sensation to dropping someone dead because you know they're not coming back. It's also satisfying knowing you used limited resources to play smarter than your victim. If players aren't watching corners, providing covering fire, or using smoke grenades and flashbangs, they're more likely to take a headshot from a more delicate and patient triggerman. The desire to experience that distinct feeling is a strong motivator to keep playing, even when you're getting steamrolled by an obviously better team.

If you've played Counter-Strike before, Global Offensive probably sounds a whole lot like Counter-Strike. Like Counter-Strike: Source before it, Global Offensive exists simply to modernize the look of the classic competitive shooter, while doing little to disrupt the core form and function. At the same time, it does enough to color outside the lines of tradition to justify your time and effort Fire is one of the most interesting new combat variables. Molotov cocktails and incendiary grenades either roast groups of guys or force them in another direction. Flames are a useful distraction or scare tactic, too. They're particularly useful during Demolition matches, which focus the fight at a single bomb site rather than giving terrorists two to pick between. The new and modified maps in this mode aren't as big as classic Counter-Strike arenas – entire sections have been cut off to direct teams toward a central location – but their thoughtful design is as intricate as ever. The Lake map is a standout -- there's a wide open yet densely populated yard around the bomb site, which is inside a sizable lakeside home with plenty of vantage points and hiding spots. To separate Demolition from Defusal, players can't buy between rounds. Instead, it takes a cue from the other new mode, Arms Race, in which each kill unlocks another weapon instantly. The better you do, the more you have to switch up the way you play, and because Demolition is so fast you'll need to be quick on your feet Unlike other game types, Arms Race allows for respawns. It's the most chaotic and care-free mode in Global Offensive, with players throwing caution to the wind for the sake of climbing the kill ladder as quickly as possible. It's a shame there are only two maps in Arms Race -- a problem that will more likely persist on consoles than PC.

If you have the option, playing the PC version is unquestionably the best way to experience Counter-Strike: Global Offensive. Mods, mouse and keyboard, and the usual PC-only options are better than the ports. Plus, Valve is much better about long-term PC support -- it abandoned Team Fortress 2 on consoles, and Portal 2's level editor was PC exclusive",True

I have had a lot of great moments in the game, including meeting many of the people I know today. The controls are orderly, the look is clean. Though the community may be generally cancerous, I have meet and seen people who aren't.

The fact that operations are also optional,, also is very nice, because unlike other shooters, this game still allows you to enjoy the maps without the pass.

And the developers, whom are some of the best listeners ever, attending to (almost) every bug and detail, and constantly updating the game.

I definitely will play more in the future with no plan on stopping.",True

1615,"[b]The game is fantastic, however: When you have a match full of players with brand new accounts, out fragging seasoned veterans, you know there is a serious problem.[/b]

CS:GO faces somewhat of a cheating epidemic, and Valve refuses to tackle the problem effectively. Valve's decision to change an already sought after game - for cheaters - into a free to play, was mind-numbingly stupid. If you are one of the lucky few, holding a high enough trust factor for this change to not directly affect you, know it adversely affects you. Recently, for example, Overwatch has become overwhelmed by spinbotters. I reviewed several dozen Overwatch Cases, every single demo had a spinbotter. Thus, these free to play spinbotting lobbies, are lessening the likelihood of other cheaters receiving the ban hammer. I know several cases of players who went weeks, to even a couple of months, cheating with publicly available, paid software, before receiving a ban. 

Further, Valve's attempts at tackling cheating, have been to put it lightly, completely unsuccessful. The introduction of ""Trusted Mode"" served as little more than a couple-hour coding barrier for cheat developers, before it was completely bypassed, yet it lowers the game's quality of life, by preventing legitimate programs, such as OBS, from hooking onto the game and capturing one's screen.

Another example of such failings is ""Trust Factor"", a conceptually solid premise, however, one which was horribly executed. Any good player will end up with a low Trust Factor, unless they are a known professional, it is an inevitable fact. False reports lower your Trust Factor; even once you go to Overwatch and through an innocent verdict, are cleared of cheating, your Trust Factor still remains in the dirt. It is truly staggering how badly this system has been implemented and managed. 

Additionally, let us not forget the automatic mute system now in play: When one is reported, even falsely, by their opponents, through them ticking every report box, the game will automatically mute the reported player (after enough of said reports) with zero checks for if they actually committed the offending behaviour; putting a black mark on their account (through a default muting of the player for all). Thereby instilling an assumption of guilt for hacking/toxicity in their teammates and opponents alike, from the very beginning of the match.

The game, at its core, is excellent however, easily the best competitive FPS available. If you manage to climb to a decent Trust Factor (near impossible as a good player) or play on third-party services such as FaceIT/ESEA, you will have a substantially better experience. As a player wishing to indulge in Valve's matchmaking; be it Wingman or Competitive, know you will encounter some cheaters (though likely far less than you believe - dependant on your trust factor) you can however take solace in the fact that: be it in days, weeks, or God forbid, months, said cheater will be banned. Thankfully, with under a week being the average length before these vermin are revoked access to the game.

In conclusion, there are less cheaters than you may surmise you are facing in your matches, however, this by no means detracts from cheating still being a huge issue. Once Valve decides to improve upon their already existing systems, such as Trust Factor and Overwatch, alongside further developing the anticheat. This will, in my opinion, become the best FPS game ever made.",True

My first encounter with the series was in 2002 in the cyber coffees, maybe i was 4-5 years old at the time and we used to play CS 1.5 and Half-Life DM, fun times :). From 2002 to this date, i've been a loyal player of the Counter-Strike series. There is no other game that made me that much addicted for such a long time, believe me. Back in the day it was Counter-Strike 1.6, now it's CS:GO.
Once i get into CS:GO, i can't quit. It's an extremely addictive game once you get into the competitive matchmaking and that's the worst thing, because i can't quit. I've been uninstalling it every week not because of rage-quits, but to prevent my self of playing it, then 4-5 days later i install it again. I love CS:GO, yet i hate it at the same time, because of my addiction problem with it.

 Pros:
The weapons and maps are relatively balanced, it runs better and easier than most 1st person shooters, plus it has customizable weapon skins (purchasable and unlockable) and a extremely large community full of amazing weapon and map creations.

Cons:
-Hackers
-Smurfs
-The autos (GS3G1 and Scar-20)
-Comp without prime matchmaking
-Naive Children
-Griefers
-The Current Rank System
-Vac's obliviousness to cheaters

Conclusion:
Obviously Valve can't fix all of these problems, and most of them are liveable so there really isn't a need. But is CSGO a good game, and should you buy it? Yes, it is a good game and while it does have it's downsides valve will occasionlly fix the big problems. Helping it's playerbase from just ragequiting the game all together. But is it worth your money? It really depends on how commited you get to fps's because I garantee you, this one takes far more time to master than any other shooter you've played before (excluding maybe insurgency or more realistic hardcore FPS games). So if you're willing to put the time in, for an hour or two of fun every night, then yes, this game is for you and I emplore you to get it.",True

1656,"It is kind of hard to say I do not like the game after > 1100 hours of gameplay. It is very addictive! 

What I love about the game is the fact that skill matters and that every player, from total noob to pro-level, has the same arsenal of guns to use. You can not get better guns or upgrades by investing money, meaning it is skill, experience and teamwork (and connection) that  makes the difference.  But you can give your guns a personal touch, by getting different skins, adding a personal name to a weapon and add stickers.  

I really like the bomb defusal mode (or bomb placement when you are a terrorist), but there are also other game types: Hostage rescue, Armsrace , Deathmatch and Demolition.  Also there is a big library with player made map, all with their own rules and styles. (aim training, headshots only, all vs all, achievement maps, platformstyle and surfmaps) 

This is my first ever FPS, so needed the first 1k hours (i am a very slow student) to learn how to hold a gun, how to recognize enemies and friends, learn game mechanics and map based tactics and to work well in a team, etc.  

The overall crappy community is not making it easy to learn the game, because specially as a starting player you get kicked out of matches all the time.  

Hey I am silver 1 (lowest competative ranking) , of course I am not a star player!  Many other players on that same level are hacking, have second accounts, or are experienced in other shooters.  And their patience level with newcomers is about 0.  So a mistake (even if i had no clue i made one) resulted often in an insta kick. 

Most absurt thing was getting kicked out of a casual match for being noob...omg really?:)  If you can't practice in a  competative match, and get kicked out of casual matches too...then how on earth can you learn how to play?  

Despite an overall crappy community, I met some awesome people. Lot of fun to play together, preferably in a full team, or just some casual matches, armsrace, deathmatch or training.  And training does pay off! 

Anyway, you would think that by now I am a pro, but hell no! I guess I have to conclude I am not talented enough to get to a high rank. On the bright side....I do not get kicked out of a team anymore, at least not that often....must be doing something good!

Still playing daily, and still loving it!   So... recommended?  Hell yeh! 

NB I just have to mention that that laguage used ingame is really bad... Maybe thats just my feminine view., but I think it extremely childish and limited to the same scolding words over and over. Quite pathetic to be honest.  I  learned to ignore it.  Loving the mute button!  I just hope that it is not a reflection of those people irl. That would be really sad.

1690,"[b][u]The Counter-Strike Of Today: CSGO[/u][/b]
CSGO is an interesting ""B2P"" game in that it does have a cash shop of sorts but manages not to flood the game with P2W items; in fact, one of my favorite things about the game is that the cash shop is almost entirely based on the player economy aside from (or often including) random in-game drops that are either direct item drops or 'crates'/'cases' (AKA lockboxes) that you can then sell to other players or utilize yourself, all while making sure that drops and purchases are 100% pure cosmetic changes.

[b]The Good:[/b]
+A fair cosmetics-only cash shop and active player economy
+Well-worth the incredible $15 price tag. This is not a cash grab: this is a fully-featured and thoroughly enjoyable game.
+Ultimately a very fun shooter that strays away from the stereotypical CoD/BF formula to immerse you in the classic Counter-Strike gameplay we know and love, but with some very intriguing updates
+New and updated weapons add longevity to the franchise, including molotovs/incendiary grenades, decoy grenades, tasers and the Negev LMG, alongside new shotguns and SMGs; returning, but updated favorites such as the M4A4 and P250 can be swapped out for alternative guns such as silenced variants of the M4 and full-auto pistols. Weapon alternates have trade-offs that leave them well-balanced and the inventory mechanic that allows you to swap weapon skins and functions on the fly make sure that the game stays fresh.
+Some balance sweeps across the maps and equipment systems (including nerfing the dreaded AWP so that leg-shots no longer instantly blow you away), and some networking, latency and registry passes leave guns feeling more accurate in your hands.
+There are a number of game modes, including a new and impressively robust ""Competitive Mode"" (which lets you stack up against other players in a ranked, more hardcore game type), and the usual Casual Mode that classic CS/1.6, CZ and Source players may be more familiar with; a limitless opportunity to customize online servers leave the player with a number of neat custom game modes and mods that breathe new life into the core game once you've had your fill of the stock gameplay.

[b]The Not-So-Good:[/b]
-Keys to cases are OBSCENELY expensive. Sticker capsules are only $1.00 to open, but you'll be paying a premium for keys at $2.50 per case at 2.5x the typical cost of ""lockboxes"" in most MMOs. Of course, I say this and it still doesn't stop me from buying and opening cases...
-There are rarely horrendous lag, latency and networking issues for some users that require a fairly advanced romp through custom configurations to fix. For the mostpart, this doesn't affect most people, but it's a nightmare for those who it does effect. It took me a lot of tinkering to get my network settings just right.

[b]Side Notes:[/b] These aren't really marks against the game, but..
*Unless you're rich, there are some skins you may want and there's a chance you'll never own them because they're so expensive or hard to find. It sucks, but #firstworldproblems shouldn't stop you from enjoying the core game.
*It will take you time to get used to the changes. New players may find themselves overwhelmed, especially if they're new to the CS formula. Don't give up! The game only gets more fun as you practice and get better -- so practice, practice, practice!",True

1708,"After more than 2000 hours of playing Counter Strike : Global Offensive, I'm going to write a review about the first person shooter. This review is aimed at [b]newbies[/b] who are thinking about starting Counter Strike or are new to it. 

Counter Strike is a unique shooter, which is my point: ""There is no comparable or similar First Person Shooter!"" The game was released on August 21, 2012 and players are still finding new ways to enrich the game. By that I mean special tactics to take a spot, outplay the enemy team, or completely individual new styles of play.

[hr][/hr]

[h1]What is there to know before starting Counter Strike?[/h1]

[list]

[*]You should get Prime and not just the free game.

Every player has to play up to level 2 in casual mode to be eligible for competitive matchmaking, before that you have no possibility to play this mode. You can buy the Prime Status as DLC in the store for 13,25€. I [b]recommend[/b] every newcomer to take this 13€ in hand and buy this status. You can get this status for free if you play your account up to level 21 in Casual, but this will take some time. If Competitive is not so important to you, you can also play up your account and use CS:GO for free. 

Here you can go directly to the Prime Status Shop page:

https://store.steampowered.com/sub/54029/?l=german

[quote=Support] Prime status users will be matched exclusively with other Prime status players in the game search and in all game modes. They will also have access to exclusive Prime souvenir items, item finds, and weapon crates, as well as all community-run servers. [/quote]

[quote=Support] Prime status is a feature for CS:GO players who have purchased CS:GO or have reached at least rank 21 (Lieutenant) in the game. Members with Prime status enjoy benefits that users without Prime status are excluded from. [/quote]

[*] Link your phone number to your Steam account.

There are several reasons why you should do this for Counter Strike. The first and most important reason is your skins. The value of some skins exceeds the value of your wallet. With your phone number and the Steam Guard app you secure your account to the maximum! Your app produces a new security code within a few seconds that you need to log in to your Steam account. No one can bypass this security code unless they have access to your smartphone.

The second reason is the Trust Factor, this factor decides with whom you will meet in Competitive. The higher your Trust Factor is, the more legitimate opponents you will get. Your mobile number linked to your profile increases this Trust Factor [b]enormously![/b] The Trust Factor also increases through your behavior within the Steam and Counter Strike community. If you are active on Steam, take care of your profile, collect badges, write reviews or receive positive feedback in Counter Strike etc. this increases your Trust Factor even more. 

[/list]

[hr][/hr]

[h1]Is Counter Strike still fun to play in 2021?[/h1]

Yes it is definitely fun to play but what I want to give you is Counter Strike is not a single player shooter. Watch ESL matches, watch training videos, download training maps from the workshop, [b]find a team[/b].

No matter what Elo you play Counter Strike benefits from having a good team with you. With a team you can increase your learning curve, your playstyle, your gamesens, your knowledge and your aim within your team will improve a lot. Especially when you play against better opponents, you usually take a lot from these games and improve yourself in all the points already mentioned.

Here you can search for teams:

https://steamcommunity.com/app/730/discussions/1/

[hr][/hr]

[h1]Are there no disadvantages? [/h1]

No game in this world is perfect, there are also disadvantages to Counter Strike. I will list them here.

[List]
[*] There are a lot of cheaters
[*] There are a lot of Smurfs (High ranked players who play on low ranks)
[*] There is a toxic community 
[*] There are people who just don't talk ingame
[*] There are bad servers (just play FaceIt o.ö for better ones)
[*] There are people who just want to fuck you up.
[/list]

There are probably so many drawbacks that I can't even list them all, but the experience in Counter Strike is unique and the game makes many players play it for thousands of hours. I alone have over 2000 hours of play and there are many who have more than 5 or even 10 thousand on their account.We are [b]not[/b] happy with every update, we are [b]not[/b] happy with every change. But we love Counter Strike and whoever gets into it even a little bit will start it the same way and learn to love it ♥

[hr][/hr]

[h1] What does bad server mean in Counter Strike?[/h1]

Counter Strike provides 64 tick servers for the competitive mode. However, providers such as FaceIT or ESEA provide 128 tick servers.

[b][u]So what does this tick mean and why is that bad?[/u][/b]

[quote=Gutefrage.net] The tick rate indicates how often the server matches information with the game clients.

The more ticks, the more regularly the information is matched.

If the tick rate is very low or there are connection problems, player 1 may see that he is doing damage, but player 2 will not notice and will not be hit. The information of player 1 was outdated, so the server could not calculate it and take it into account for the other players.

64 ticks means that the information is exchanged 64 times per second. 128 ticks correspondingly double the information flow and pass on much more accurate movement and hit information even within this minimal time window. [/quote]

[hr][/hr]

If you follow the above mentioned points, you will bypass the cheaters for the most part, the rest will remain the same. But you will learn many different foreign languages like Russian, Turkish, English or even Polish. If you are not too upset and not convinced of your silver ego that you are the best player in the world, I can only recommend CS:GO.

I wish you a lot of fun and if you have any questions Youtube, Steam Guids or the CSGO discussions will help. If you have other questions check out my profile :)",True

1712,"Pros :
+ Requires skill,you cannot simply point and shoot with 95% accuracy like Call of Duty
+ Intense gameplay with a lot of serious players (Competitive Mode)
+ Really challenging due to the unique recoil pattern
+ Slow paced and you won't need to worry to get MLG-360-No-Scoped in a matter of seconds like in Call of Duty
+ Pretty cheap for this quality of game
+ Great graphics
+ Asian server available,I add this to the pros because a lot of games never open a server at Asia,especially South East Asia
+ A lot of good tutorials to help you get a head start available on YouTube (Check out TheWarOwl)
+ Not pay to win,cosmetics only
+ A lot of new and redesigned weapons from previous Counter Strike series
+ You can try tons of interesting techniques and strategies with your teammates

Cons :
- Sometimes,the community will get too serious due to the big prizes offered in tournaments and in-game quarrel are often inevitable 
- Requires you to buy a certain bundle to advance your rank faster (ex. Op.Bloodhound)
- A lot of immature players (South East Asian server)
- A lot of non english speaker shouting in voice chats with crappy mics (South East Asian server)
- A lot of non communicative player even in competitive gameplay

第一次看比赛是14的科隆Major，15年初我开始在斗鱼转播国外高清的比赛。那时候主播很少，妹子也没有。虽然看不太懂，但是就是觉得很好看。
每天半夜四点爬起来转播比赛，用着小银条的技术给大家“解说”。观看的人很多，弹幕被刷的满满的，想想就超级激动。
还记当时直播的是15年卡托，Fnatic拿的冠军。那天yicofan也在qq里和直播间里跟我通宵看了一场。
已经不再怎么玩游戏的我，一辈子都没有想到...整整一年后我和yicofan站在了卡托维兹的决赛舞台前看比赛

- Queing up vs fullpremade teams as solo!

-If you arent familiar with russian greetings you should inform yourself before joining a game, else you would be 
confused about CYKA BLIAT VODKA VODKA, YOUR MOTHER IS A *BIEEEEP*!
- Do you like arabians?? Better be friendly to them, because teamkilling is what they stand for.
- Matchmaking is starting 4vs5 games, enjoy your bot! 
- People get random Matchmaking bans, because they can`t reconnect due to bugs!
-You have to decide what player you are, you have 2 options. You can be the noob or the hacker. 

As Noob you basically have worse than 1,0 kd. As Hacker you are above 1,0kd, pretty simple, isnt it.

Positiv things to say about CSGO:
- meet people from all around t̶h̶e̶ ̶w̶o̶r̶l̶d̶ Russia
- learn abusive words in all languages
- fun for the whole family, meet all ages between 50 and 10
- opening a case for 2.19€ and get a 0.03€ skin is very fun
- 64-tick servers are fun for everybody

Negativ things one should mention:
- toxic people everywhere
- skins lead to empty bankaccount
- some are using toasters as their microphone
- still too many russians which abuse you for not speaking russian
- playing in gold elo is harder than playing mg elo
- after 500 hours in CS you have to invest in a string just to be prepared for emergencies

View of playing CS as a girl:
- always fun M8s are abusive kids or kids trying to flirt with you
- comments like ""girls shouldn´t play this"", ""women have no rights"" or ""go in the kitchen"" ... and YES their mommy are be very proud of their remark
- best comment until now : 10y/o russian kid ""go play cooking simulator"" as well as some N-bombs through the Game

1752,"Edit 2021: After I stopped collection and took a LONG break from CS:GO it's still an amazing game and experience with friends. Love what Valve did with the MM system so far and hope they keep working on content for this game <3

Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is a tactical fist person shooter (fps). I my self prefer CS:GO over 1.6 and Source because of the competitive element that they put in the game (pubbs). Not saying that you couldn't skrim in 1.6 and Source, the matchmaking is just a step in the right direction. 

The Overwatch feature is a great idea to make the community help with the hacking and griefing problem that you might bump into from time to time. 

CS:GO is also difrent in the way that you can have skins in game that everyone can see. I didn't really know what to think about it when Valve put the skins in the game, but I can't but love them. I don't really want to admit how much I've spent on skins, keys and crates... but GABE!... you sure know how to make money... So more into the skins on the guns. You can get drops in game, any game and you are limited to 2 drops per day and 4 drops per week or at least at the time I was writing this (18.12.2013). You can also buy keys (2.49$) for the crates that drop in game and then there is also the good old market place. It might save you a couple of bucks if you just buy them there, then you get the wepons you want and don't have to take the risk og getting ""bad"" skins, that is if you don't have a lot of money to spend. They have adopted some ideas from Tf2 (it's there game so they can do what ever they want...) and the have put StatTrak on some weapons where you can follow how many players you have killed with that particular weapon. The StatTrak Counter only counts real people not BOTs.

They now have there own servers and the normal deticated once you love and know from 1.6 and Source, Where you can fight Zombies, Surf, sharpen your skills on Aim maps and many other wonderfull things. They also have modes such as ""Arms Race"" (gun gmae), demolition (basically one site plant with a GG twist) and much more. Then we come to the competitive side of the game that I've been playing a lot of resently. I can't but love it, how they use the matchmaking to make equals battle it out... (not always succesful but everyone has bad days and good days in CS). I would though like it if they would make it so if someone leaves or wasn't able to connect that it would be safe for the other players to leave, like they did in Dota 2. I have lost too many games because some rage quits or just DC's. I my self have DC'd a couple of time due to bad internet and that probably costed my teamates the game.
Other wise the competitive community is good atm. there will come the time where you will end up with a horrible team, but if you don't like joining a game with random strangers then you can always make/join a clan or a team to play with.

The maps are mostly the same but they have changed some of them like Dust, Mirage, Aztec and more. The have also had community made maps like the ""Operation Bravo"" and ""Operation Payback"" packs. With both bomb and hostage oriented maps. Basically they've made some tweaks and fixes for the competitive play.

But in short, the game is amazing for anyone that loves stategy, fps and commpetitive play. The game is also for the casual players that just want to shoot somthing and have some fun. The game is everything I wanted and more :) 4,5/5. They could though adobt the safe leaving feature if someone RQ or DC's from the game like in Dota 2. Amazing job Valve.

Matchmaking brings a real interest in the game by providing a constant increase in its level and offering games based on its level through the presence of a rank system, it is increasing or decreasing the contrary based on win / loss matches obtained.

The acquisition of different badges and trophies displayed on their profile and the ability to get weekly boxes to receive new skins for its weapons is a complete success and brings a real interest in the game.

In addition, every quarter a new operation allows us to discover completely new maps and fill new goals for a new badge.

1769,"I finally decided to write a proper review for CS:GO. So... I bought this game within a week of playing my first few games of Counter Strike: Source. I was not disappointed. I know it's a bit of a bore reading shit like this but if you're looking for an overall 'view' on CSGO, skip down to the bottom for my overall view.

[b]Will you run it?[/b]
Chances are you'll be able to run it... It isn't exactly the most intensive game so you'll probably be able to run it smooth at a constant 60fps with anything built less than five years ago.

[b]Community[/b]
The community is nice enough and often help you in the form of them raging at you through the mic. Okay... So, the community... Isn't the nicest. Before people rage at me... Not all of the community is so bad, just the minority that can be... Pardon my language... D********... Some people complain about the russians, some of them can be quite annoying... Thank god for the 'block communication' feature but not all scream 'cyka blyat' down the mic.

[b]Graphics[/b]
If you're looking for a super aesthetically pleasing-Planetside 2 ultra looking game then CS isn't for you... The graphics aren't bad but it's not going to win any prizes either. What I will say is that it's a large jump from Source... Where this game truly shines is in its gameplay.

[b]Gameplay[/b]
The game is largely skill based, and from what I've played so far, requires a large amount of dedication to learn maps and how to use each of the weapons. If you're coming from COD-like shooters as I did you're going to need to be prepared to spend hours of practice in casual in order to learn spray patterns, smoke spots and other subtle hints which can make a massive difference in competitive play. There's a wide arsenal of weapons, ranging from extremely short range (the shotguns) to extremely long range (snipers). Unlike other shooters with a wide arsenal of weaponry, each weapons has its place and time. Eg, 3 different rifles for each team (excluding the snipers). The standard M4 and AK for a full buy but also the famas and galil for a force buy, aswell as the SG and AUG if you're a baller. $_$ One of THE most surprising features of the game was the extremely useful nature of the nades. You'll go into your first game buying 0 nades, yet after your 2nd game they'll be one of the most utilised items in your arsenal. No. I'm not talking about that frag that kills everyone within a 5m radius in any other game you've played. I'm talking about the flashes, moltovs and smokes, in fact, even the decoy has its place. You'll end your 2nd game hating the frag however. Sure, it's good taking 20hp off a coupla people holding B site in Dust 2 but you sure as hell aren't gonna get any kills with the bitch.  As I said earlier, the community does help sometimes, most often in competitive however.
Gamemodes
There's 5 official gamemodes:
Arms Race
Deathmatch
Demolition
Hostage
Bomb
All official gamemodes are teambased, emphasising the teamwork element of the competitive game modes yet some gamemodes do not at all rely on teamwork such as Deathmatch or Arms Race which is based mainly on your individual skill.

Arms Race
Here, you'll be in teams however, as a solo player, you'll be looking to reach the golden knife first. You get points for each weapon kill which will help in the advancement to the next weapon level.

Deathmatch
Here, you are also playing as teams however, the main objective is to end the game with the most points. I think it should be renamed 'AWPmatch' personally, considering over 60% of the players use it. I sometimes wonder why people even bother using custom AWP community servers.

Demolition
Here's a gamemode I have yet to build an opinion on, having played it very little. Each kill every new round lets you advance to the next weapon. So what happens if you get multiple kills in a round? I hear you ask. FRAGS! Well, for each extra kill, past the first I mean, you get an extra frag grenade. Eh, f*** my shitty explanations, I'll give you an example. So, for example, you enter a round, get 3 kills and annihilate the enemy team. You'll advance to the next weapon due to your kill but also earn yourself 2 extra frags to use in the following round!

Bomb
So... I'm not sure about the official name of the gamemode but it's the gamemode most previous CS players will be extremely familiar with. There's Counter Terrorists and Terrorists. Counter Terrorists playing the defensive role for the main part of the round while Terrorists will be looking to head to one of the sites and plant the bomb. You start the round with $800 in pocket and looking to spend as efficiently as possible in order to win the pistol rounds which will leave you in good steed for the oncoming rounds. Each round starts with a counter of two minutes, which if the counter terrorists run down, will lend themselves a victory. Within this time period, the Terrorists will be looking to plant the bomb, shortening the round time down to 45seconds, which is the time taken for the bomb to explode. The Counter Terrorists then have to defuse within the time limit. The round is won by Counter Terrorists by either running down the clock, defusing the bomb, or eliminating all of the Terrorists. It is won by Terrorists by planting the bomb and it exploding, or by eliminating the Counter Terrorists. Each round win lends more money than a round loss however increasing streaks of round losses lends itself more money. HOWEVER if the Counter Terrorists (Or CTs) run down the clock and win the round, the terrorists will not earn any money for that round lost. Money is also earned by planting and defusing the bomb and for getting kills, with a knife kill yielding the most of $1500 (on the enemy team of course). A teamkill however leads to a loss of money which can be a pain in the arse unless you're a baller with $16k.

Hostage
Largely the same game mechanics as the previous game mode so I won't go back through it all but with an extreme role reversal, with CTs playing an offensive role and Terrorists (CT) playing a defensive role. The CTs objective is to get the hostages back to their spawn point while the TTs have to defend and either run down the clock or eliminate the CTs.

[b]Sounds[/b]
The weapon sounds aren't accurate in the slightest but do however sound pleasing and distinctive which can help in competitive play. Sneaky beaky like... The first time I heard that I lolled<--Nuff said...

[u]Miscellaneous[/u]

[b]Skins[/b]

Skins are dropped randomly after every game. These are for the majority, shit 'common' £0.03 skins and I even find that they often look worse than the default colours. You can also get skins from cases but most aren't very good and are worth a whole lot of shit compared to the ~$2 you payed for the Goddamn, motherf****** key. Some skins do look real nice though and I've heard also give extra damage bonuses and s***. ;)

[b]Skill levels[/b]

As of the new update, a ranking system was implemented. You get xp for your games which increases your level. Each new rank for each new week will grant you a skin. Mind you, they are all shitty unless you have the new pass.

[b]Ranks[/b]

So... No one actually knows how this mysterious system works but that it's based on an ELO system. Each win supposedly increases your ELO while a loss decreases it. Number of MVPs also supposedly increases it. This is factored into matchmaking but is abused by the Smurfs that plague the game.

[b]Overall[/b]
A word of warning... This game isn't fun... It's repetitive, boring, really fustrating but goddamn f****** addictive... If you're looking for a game that's fun I'd suggest COD but it doesn't have the same... 'feel' as CS and not near enough rewarding when you get a kill. 
Overall I'd give it a solid 9/10 just down to the fact that some of the community isn't the nicest at the best of times...",True

1775,"Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is the newest version of the well known game Counter-Strike.
Global Offensive has a lot of different game modes besides of the classic bomb defusal/hostage rescue scenarios.
Deathmatch, basically is about getting a lot of kills and dying as few times as possible. You will spawn at random space with your chosen weapons or random ones.
In Arms Race you have to get kills with every weapon. The fastest player wins.
Demolition can be a Bomb mission or hostage rescue on smaller maps compared to the regular bomb or hostage missions.
Competitive is the hardest and most interesting type and is only recommended for advanced players. You have to win a minimum 16 rounds to win the game. This gamemode may take up to 90 minutes. Communication is the key here to win.
Counter-Strike: Global Offensive also support ingame items, but it is a purely cosmetic thing.
You will also have a chance to support the game by buying special tickets for the so-called ""Operations"". With an operation pass you will get access to newly released competitive maps, new weapon skins and an upgradeable medal.
The graphics are much better than Counter Strike Source. The environments are more detailed and the game just looks a whole lot better.
Global Offensive is one of the top 10 most played games on Steam right now, so there are plenty of players and servers.
The mechanics are different from former Counter-Strike games, like the recoil for each weapon and new weapons like decoy, Molotov, etc. This could be difficulty for veteran players at the beginning. But after a while you can deal with it.
Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is a definite buy for anyone that is into Counter-Strike. It is definitely worth the regular price of 13,99€.
A must have for every Steam user!

It's not only competitive, it has side games in community servers like Trouble In Terrorist Town, Bunny Hopping, Surfing, etc. 

This game can give you a great advancement in your mental state. You need patience to be an AWPer, You need extra time to train for weapon sprays, reaction time, aim, and just plain pratice to get better.

Casual:
10 on 10 Bomb Mission, great for getting to know the maps because if you are new and bad/and or do not kow what your doing nobody will care. Very Fun, and can meet some interesting ""Characters"".

Demolition:
One of the mini type of gamemode in Counter Strike: GO.
This is a 5 on 5 Bomb Mission with only 1 bomb site. Once you get a kill the next round you upgrade to a better or worst weapon. I use this for pratice or if a friend needs help.

Arms Race (Gun Game):
This is a pretty old game mode with a new name. Your on a Team Death Match, but every 2 kills you upgrade your weapon.

Deathmatch:
The best way to pratice, all guns are free you get infinite ammo (sv_infiniteammo 2(Reloads after 1 Magazine)) YOU WILL NEED TO PRATICE ON HERE (NOT WITH BOTS)


Competitive:
The most played and most stressed game mode in CSGO. ITs a 5 v 5 with skill groups S1 to GE
As your skill gets better you get a better rank, and harder enemies. Do not solo que because, you will get fucking retarded teammates who dont know what the fuck they are doing, best to find friends that you can agree on strats, and buy.

1785,"At the momment the only competitive FPS game with some of the good implementetions when it comes to matchmaking and also playing with your friends. Has very steep learning curve when it comes to weapons ( recoil, spread etc.). I would reccomend this game unless you are anoyed by next few things i am about to mention.
First and foremost, Russians. Very annoying, trying to communicate in their native language even if it not a international language. Words they use, blyet, sukha.
Second problem, kids. Because of this game i decided i will NEVER have kids, they are god awful creatures if you give them PC-s and a bad headset. Tend to scream and curse, even when not provoked. 
Of course ""block communication"" is a viable option but then you exlude one of the biggest parts of this game out of it.
Still i like the game and i think it would worth you a while to buy it and play it.

Added on 2014.10.17
After so many hours, i have found a fundamental flaw with this game. It is called the  ""a cooldown period"". What it does basically is punsihing you for leaving game, killing team mates or dealing damage to your team mates. Also if you lose connection you will be spanked by valve.
Why is this a flawed system, well i will explain that with as few words as possible.
First of all is noobnes level of the players i play with *silver. You may throw grenade and he might run into it and die, of course who gets punished, YOU. Again russians and how retardedly persistant they are. If you say B, you can almost guarantee he wil go on A screaming at the same time ""SUKA, BLYET, OBAMA BAD"". So eventually you are forced to kill him, take the bomb and plant. I wrote this review in hope to get some feedback because i play 2-3 matches and then back to 7 day period cooldown.

As a fan of the genre this game feels like a revitalized classic with some great improvements and additions borrowed from other Valve games. After more than a decade of the same FPS Dust 2 action, the weapon cases, skins, and community maps included via the Workshop pump new life into the genre and bring me back to the heyday of Counter-Strike beta, before Steam even existed... but with a whole lot more value. I won't touch on any negative aspects because I could nitpick and complain about small things that really don't impact the experience.

Pros:
+Has the option of competitive
+Fairly Balanced
+No Game Changing items
+Fair Economy (Skins and Items)
+Easy to setup (Lobbies with Friends, Custom Crosshairs/Changing Viewmodels)
+No way to gain an advantage (Except Skill)
+Good Anti-Cheat and Overwatch
+Teamwork is needed

Cons:
-Very Toxic, occasionally helpful, community. (Full of Trolls, Ragers, ect.)
-Some weapons can be used so abusely and unskillful as it makes the game unfair. (P90)
Edit: This can be combatted by approaching the P90 users from a position that gives you an advantage. Credit goes to Bunnikinz! Thanks for the advice!

Neutrals:
(Depending on how you see it, it can be viewed as a pro or a con)
=If you disconnect from a competitive match, you have 3 minutes to get back in or you cannot get back in even if you do get back on. (One of my friends computer bluescreens occasionally during comp and his reboot time isn't enough to get back on time)
=Ranking System, the ranking system prevents smurfs from appearing as often but gives the new player a huge grind before being able to play competitive. (Smurf = A skilled player, usually of the ranks Distinguished Master Guardian - Global Elite, who makes a new account to play with lower skilled players often ruining the game for the opposing team.) Also as you move higher in the ranks you will find more hackers, especially in Supreme First Class and Global Elite games. What most players do is go on ESEA servers where their Anti-cheat is a bit better than Valves.

Final Verdict: 9/10 although the game is really good it does has somethings I'd like improved.

What I'd like to be improved that can be fixed:
+Report System, As much as the VAC system is good, it's always going to be flawed as it won't be able to detect a hacker 100%. Valve is trying to fix this with Overwatch, a system of which hand-picked players (usually high ranked and have many hours in the game) review a demo that is recorded of the game of whom is reported from and votes on whether the suspect is either hacking/greifing or not. What most youtubers who record Overwatch and people who use Overwatch want, they want to see what the suspect is reported for as when reporting someone you're given three options: Hacking, Greifing, or Other. This allows the reviewer to look out for what is the player is reported for making it justifiably easier and more accurate.

Note: As I put more hours into this game it will advance, so this review will be edited in the future for it to be more accurate.",True

1820,"You want buy this game ? 
I'm gonna show you somes tips for playing :
- Before the match starts, don't press accept. It's a test. 
- The P in P90 stands for Pro. Like you. 
- When told to pick up the AWP, stare at it and go AFK. 
- Don't buy kits, this is actually team death match, the bomb wont ever get planted. 
- You are amazing with the desert eagle, don't let anyone ever tell you different, not even the scoreboard. 
- Very important: That thing attached to some guns is called a silencer, and you have to take it off because it reduces damage a lot and will get you more kills. 
- VAC is a good anti cheat. 
- Skins make you better at the game. 
- When a teammate asks for a drop, drop them your handgun. 
- Never adapt to the game. Don't betray yourself like that. Just do the same thing over and over again and wait until it works. 
- Dust 2 is the only map in the game. There aren't any others. Don't argue. 
- If you lose the first round. You MUST ALWAYS Eco/Save. Which means buy armour and an -SMG/Shotgun of your choosing. 
- When going through doors, always make sure that you block the doors so no one can pass. - -- Ignore the hate of your teammates, you're pro and you're gonna get mad kills. You're also shielding them from bullets. How nice of you! 
- Crouching doesn't improve accuracy, but do you know what does? Jumping! Be a ♥♥♥♥ing kangaroo and watch the mad kills pour in. ♥♥♥♥ EVERYONE LOVES KANGAROOS. 
50 points to Gryffindor every time you change weapons. 
- State that all SMG's take skill to use from no less than 4 inches away. Your gun is cheaper so it is worse. Rub it in with a teabag afterwards. Especially if you have a P90. 
- Always tell the opposing team to good luck and have fun when warm-up ends. At half time, treat them like they murdered your family. (Be sure to take note of their nationality!) 
- If you see a chicken in your gameplay, you absolutely must under any circumstance, kill that damn chicken. It must die. THIS IS NON NEGOTIABLE. 
- Recoil control is a myth. Like Bigfoot.
- If you need to get around the map in a hurry, get out your Negev. 
- The PP-Bizon is the discount Negev. 
- Don't waste money on a helmet. $350 is too expensive. You wont die. Ever. 
- You need to Look at the ground where you are going make sure you don't trip!

1823,"Soooo... this game is now free to play. Used to be priced at $15. I suppose it was because of Artifact being a complete disaster. But it would all be a contradiction in that case. Long story short, game developers no longer know what they're doing. First a battle royale mode, and now this...?
What actually costs money is the
Prime Edition, which pretty much gives you preference in terms of matchmaking. Which means you'll most likely face other players who bought the game more often.
The main problem being that, as it is now a F2P game, hackers won't need to pay up to cheat. If they're banned, they can just make another account. Now, to the actual review.

The game is good overall. Mostly based on you using your sight and your hearing to locate enemies. And also controlling your weapon's recoil.
Although your weapon may seem normal in your screen, the bullet pattern will certainly not be normal, especially if you're used to spray and pray.
Of course, there will be moments of tension where aiming a centimeter lower may get you a kill, or get you killed.
Toxicity levels aren't high, but they're not low either. It's what you can expect from a game with a competitive scene nowadays. 
As you no longer need to pay to play it, installing it is up to you.
One thing I'll mention though: just tap fire with the AK-47. And if you're using the AWP, you may want to save the ''honor of using a Sniper rifle to headshot people, because that's why the rifle has a scope on it''.

1828,"CSGO is a near-perfect multiplayer shooter. Unlike the previous versions, which were often difficult to get in to, this one offers a variety of modes that will appeal to all skill levels. It has a large community and a well supported workshop, ensuring that this discount-priced game will be around for years to come.

In short, you either play as the good or bad guys and must either kill the other team or complete objectives to win the round, which will earn you more money to do the same thing again but faster. It's been around for years and has spawned many imitators.

The game isn't much of a looker as it is based on the same engine as the original Half Life 2 was. However, Valve have polished it as much as they can and the community consists of lots of awesome mappers who have been churning out brilliantly imaginative and beautiful maps almost on a daily basis.

Is it worth getting if you already own Counter Strike: Source? Yes. CSS was always Counter Strike shoe-horned into the Source engine. CSGO feels far more like a standalone game. Valve have very carefully listened to what people have wanted and have made a very appealing game. The best feature must be the competitive play. You cannot leave these matches or you'll suffer a temporary ban from the feature. After 10 wins in this mode you'll be ranked and will be paired up with people of the same skill, meaning that the game is challenging but fair regardless of your skill level. These matches are exciting, occasionally scary or frustrating, but are the most rewarding part of the game and improving your rank is one of the most satisfying experiences in any video game, ever.

1830,"CS:GO may seem too familiar to those who have played Source. Source felt a bit wishy-washy, with no official modes and servers. CS:GO is not only well-organised but more catering to less experienced players whilst still retaining the essence of what makes counter-strike a proffessional gamer's shooter. New weapons may seem more like reskins but I prefer the simplicity of having no silencers and the properly working stats and decent achievements right from the game's release as oppose to an update 5 years after the game's release or something. Global Offensive's graphics aren't vastly different, but it is certainly the best looking shooter on the Source engine to date, and doesn't look as outdated as it should do for a 2004 game engine. The game seems well balanced, snipers are impressive, the Scout/SSG is no longer terrible and genuinely viable in competitive matches. Blur is added to sniper scopes while moving to balance them too. WWeapons do seem balanced and people use more than just AK, MR, Deagle and AWP. The 4 game modes - Casual Competitive, Classic Competitive, Demolition and Arms Race means there's something for everyone. Sure there's no Capture the Flag but in a game where there's no sprinting, health regen, killstreaks, aim down sights or ability to revive or heal teammates, it's probably for the best. Gun game is finally officially supported, and Demolition simplifies the game by removing the need to buy weapons. I've always wanted to try counter-strike properly but Source was just far too disorganised and had other distractions. Global Offensive brings the classic game into a modern setting without falling into the trap of being a Call of Duty clone. It's still counter-strike, with exactly the same gameplay mechanics as the original, but presented in a more appealing and fun package. It certainly feels more welcoming for newcomers than Source, which is a big plus not only for competitive gaming but for the franchise as a whole. The only thing lacking is Team Deathmatch, however this would require a ""Create a Class"" which would turn it into CoD. Arms Race fills that spot, and Demolition combines Classic CS with Gun Game. The primary reason why this game is more accomodating is because it was meant to be a port of Source to Xbox LIVE, so obviously some things needed to be changed or added to broaden its appeal. And for the most part, Valve have done a great job. Matchmaking is efficient, bots for offline play are exclellent with decent AI programming rather than the predictably linear Source AI and the package as whole is much more modern as oppose to Source, where it was a case of ""too little, too late"" when they decided to update it. If you haven't played CS before and want to give it a go, this is the best game.

1835,"In this game you are a Terrorist or elite Counter-Terrorist who has never fired a gun in their life before a round starts. You must help your character learn how to control their guns while killing enemies. Strangely, each character has the mysterious power to fire one or two shots without ridiculous recoil by very briefly jerking in the opposite direction they are moving in.

When your character wears a Kevlar vest, every part of your character, except the head, are made out of steel. Therefore, the only way to quickly kill people is to shoot them in the head. This can be annoying at first, but you will soon get used to shooting a small smudge of pixels on top of a character's body.

The Goddess of Guns can materialize guns in your character's hands a few seconds before a round starts. However, your character must pay for the guns, which have vastly overinflated prices. When you have the right amount of money, the Goddess will flash a menu in your character's eyes, allowing them to select the guns they want. More advanced users can make guns materialize out of thin air with their mind as long as they have the right amount of money.

Maps are often about evil terrorists trying to bomb deserted places. Vandalism is a very serious crime in the Counter-Strike series, so elite Counter-Terrorists are deployed to stop them. Unfortunately for the Terrorists, they are dumb and only packed one bomb. However, the Counter-Terrorists do not know how to pick up a dropped bomb, so the Terrorists can still pick it up after it is dropped by a fallen friend.

In some maps, the terrorists have kidnapped a janitor and low-level desk jockey in a building. The Counter-Terrorists have been deployed to save one, not both, of the hostages. In reality, this is just a thinly-veiled excuse for the CTs to murder the Terrorists while pumping rounds into the invincible hostages. One weird thing about hostage maps is that you can purchase a ""Hostage Rescue Kit"", which somehow makes gives you the ability to put a grown man on your shoulders in a second. Perhaps it is a spell scroll that allows hostages to hover to your character's shoulders.

Overall, Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is a surprisingly solid game about people with the worst gun handling abilities ever seen on Earth. Even though your characters have the aiming abilities of someone with Parkinsons Disease, you have many tactical options that make the game very fun and dynamic. It's worth picking up.",True

Counter Strike: Global Offensive is an amazing highly competitive shooter that is really engaging, and is probably the best in its genre if you are an FPS player. 

I don't really enjoy FPS games any more and I have quit CSGO indefinitely mostly due to it becoming stale and boring for me, and also the serious large-scale cheating problem. After a few hundred or thousand (like me) hours, the cheating problem in Counter Strike quickly begins to agitate you. You have to waste 40 minutes of your life in a game that you have absolutely no chance of winning, and also your account is punished, and your matchmaking decreases through no fault of your own.

Most Valve games it seems are heavily infested with cheaters, because Team Fortress 2 is exactly the same and even cheats are creeping into Dota 2, certainly boosting is rampant within Dota (which is another big problem in CSGO, having many smurfs in your lower ranked games which also kills the fun just like cheaters).

Counter Strike is both noob-friendly and also pro-friendly. It's a game with an enormous skill ceiling and players of all skill will find the game fun provided they like shooter games. I'd rate the gameplay a solid 9/10, but Valve's inability to combat the widespread cheating problems, combined with an absurd loot crate system that literally enables and encourages people to spend THOUSANDS of their currency just to own a virtual item (Yes, I know nobody is forced to buy skins, and you can play the game just fine without them, but please open your eyes to the fact that skins are thrown everywhere you look in your face, and it's a natural human tendency to want what others have too, but most players will be priced out of acquiring the best skins on this game because they sell for an absurd cost...) forces me to lower my final score rating to an 7.5/10.

I will always recommend a game that brought me 2,000 hours of (not all because of the cheaters) enjoyment, but a significant portion of those hours did give me fun.

----------------------------------------
Overall Game
----------------------------------------
CS:GO has a lot of gameplay options for players - community servers offering a variety of game modes, casual gaming ranging from defuse maps, hostage maps, deathmatch mode, and a fast-paced Arms Race mode where you aim to go through each weapon until you get a Golden Knife kill to win.  Beyond casual gaming, there is a competitive system that rank-matches you, similar to many other FPS games, and runs for up to 30 rounds of CS, after which your rank is affected one way or another.

Competitive play is both extremely challenging and extremely rewarding, although some players either take it far too seriously or treat it like casual unranked gaming.  It's hard to find a team that sits in the nice middle ground between the two.

If you've played a shooter game before, GO will be familiar.  WASD, crouching, walking (as opposed to running), and grenades.  It's relatively straightforward gameplay, only made hard by the skill of your opponents.

The game has a bit of a learning curve.  Each weapon acts differently and may take some time to learn which you like and which works best in certain situations.  After that, the grenades are the next thing to consider attempting to master.  They often can turn a losing game into a winning one.

The best way to learn is to play, so get in there and have fun. :D

Overall Rating: 9/10


----------------------------------------
Overall Accessibility
----------------------------------------
CS:GO is not very accessible for deaf gamers.

The game itself has no captions that I have been able to find, but the only thing that would need captioning is the weapons tutorial that you're likely to use once, if at all.

CS can consistently be a challenge to deaf gamers because of the significant impact of sound during play.  Many players OFTEN sit and wait for the enemy to come near, reacting to footsteps or grenades/weapon fire that cannot be seen, but can be easily heard.  One particular edge hearing gamers have over deaf gamers is guard the target area from a distance by listening for nearby enemies, only moving out of hiding when they need to.  A deaf gamer's need to see the target site to properly defend it puts them at greater risk of being killed.

Additionally, competitive mode gamers make heavy use of the microphone capability to communicate quickly.  There are text/voice binds in game (using the Z, X, and C keys) that can convey significant messages rather quickly and easily, but I find that most hearing gamers at mid-level skill are not receptive to either the voice binds or to text chat.

Deaf gamers in competitive gaming may encounter hostility or discrimination from hearing gamers.

Tho I can still have fun despite them not speaking remotely close to English or listening to me.
I've been up and down the ranks numerous times meeting people that are anywhere from Silver 1 to Global elite.
Still fun :D

Old part of the review from January 2014:
I have recently started playing this more and more (WHY DID I NOT START EARLIER). The game is a blast playing with friends and even randoms that do comunicate. Getting awarded with items at random after a matchmaking game is a good way to keep you playing.",True

1886,"[h1][b]DISCLAIMER[/b][/h1]
[b]The review you are about to read is based on my own experience with the game and my own personal judgment and rating system! No third party has impacted anything said in this review. This review is also 100% spoiler free, so you don't need to worry about that either.[/b]

[h1][b]Gameplay and Movement Controls (20 out of 20)[/b][/h1]
[b]In terms of gameplay, you get what you'd expect from a competitive shooter which is Counter-Strike. It lacks nothing. CS:GO has everything: smooth, stable and very responsive controls that some other first-person shooter games can only dream of. It also features a ton of remapable key-binds which improves the experience even further. Everything you see on your screen is customizable, literally everything. There are a ton of commands to improve things such as radar, crosshair, user-interface layout, and view model. As I said, pretty much everything is customizable. The game has not yet received unranked matchmaking, which would probably be the greatest addition to the game since you would be able to queue with friends of lower or higher ranks just for fun.[/b]

[h1][b]Graphics and Sound Quality (14 out of 20)[/b][/h1]
[b]As expected, CS:GO does not feature fancy graphics but rather very polished flat textures and environments. Some maps are prettier than others. Why? Some of the map designs are very old, and some received overhauls over the years. These overhauls and redesigns should be done at once for all maps, or at least one map per month if they already decided to rework them. One rework per year isn't doing it any justice, but I can understand why they're doing it that way. If they rework all the maps at once, imagine the frustration and amount of time the professional scene has to put into mastering them all over again, it'd be a disaster. This way, you get one reworked map that looks like something from the future Counter-Strike game, while some other maps look like a map from Counter-Strike 1.6. The sound has also received multiple updates since its release. This is probably one of the most improved aspects of the game. As for the issues and problems, there are and always will be some problems and issues here and there, but thankfully as soon as the community discovers some flaws - Valve tends to fix them rather quickly. My only question here is: how the heck is it even possible that the developers don't know or can't find these flaws before even releasing an update to the game? I know there's only a few people in the development team for Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, but yeah... these major updates should be double checked before publishing. There are also a ton of things that you simply have to learn over time in order to play this game. More on this later in the review.[/b]

[h1][b]Performance and Optimization (16 out of 20)[/b][/h1]
[b]Performance... well... this is one of these games which you simply can't play and enjoy while playing it at lower than 120fps. It simply doesn't work for serious matchmaking and you're going to experience all kinds of hick-ups and stutters along the way. Everything above 120fps is very playable and you can't really notice a difference between 160fps and 300fps unless you have a higher refresh rate monitor. It's a game based on the Source engine and you already know how it handles things. Even tho the game received all kinds of improvements in all aspects of the game, Valve still managed to keep the game playable for people playing on low-end hardware. There are various techniques in place to help the system handle all these loads and pre-loads of the assets. Yes, there are a lot of assets disappearing in the distance when you're moving away from them, but you will barely notice it unless you're distinctly looking at them. While 128-tick servers would be a nice and welcome addition, it's simply not possible at this state. The game would be so demanding that most of the people wouldn't be able to play it normally anymore. 64-tick it is for now, until they update it to Source 2 or find a different way to implement this feature. But if you really want to improve your game and enjoy it even more (with or without friends) - play it on FACEIT or ESEA. Servers over there are far more stable. I almost forgot to mention, there are a ton of fun servers in the community servers section. If you ever get bored of standard and default game modes, there are a TON of servers with different stuff that you can try out. Mainly surf and bunny hop servers (alongside servers just dedicated to standard deathmatch, pistols only deathmatch, headshot only, awp only, you name it) where you can kill a few hours of 'boring' time in a blink of an eye.[/b]

[h1][b]Story and Replayability (16 out of 20)[/b][/h1]
[b]There's no story unless you count operations as a story pack every now and then, but there's a ton of replayability. The operations are always a nice addition to the game, but I don't understand why don't they just keep these missions and everything you pay for as a part of the game that you can go back to and play over again with friends. Operations are a limited time packs of missions and objectives (and even new game modes) that you have to complete in order to receive a coin. I won't go in-depth for the operations analyzation, but that's how it goes. They release the pack, you get the pack and enjoy these missions and objectives while they last. It's strange that Valve hasn't implemented some kind of weekly objectives or missions just yet, that'd make some people that stopped playing the game to reconsider coming back to the game, at least to play it for fun. As I mentioned above, there's a lot of replayability. You can play one map literally twenty-five times in a row and none of the matches will look the same or even similar to each other. It's strange but very true. Also, if you want to enjoy the game to its fullest - you gotta learn all the maps by practicing or playing them over and over again. There are a ton of things that each of the maps has on offer that you simply have to learn in order to even be decent at it. You gotta see it for yourself to believe it.[/b]

[h1][b]Animations and Interaction (20 out of 20)[/b][/h1]
[b]The game has also received a ton of updates for animations, interaction and balance. Every once in a while you can expect some of the weapons to be nerfed or buffed. This is one of the parts of the game that constantly keeps on changing, and you really gotta keep the track of everything in order to be improving at the game. There are a ton of weapons and every single one of them behaves differently. Every weapon has its own spray pattern and in order to get better, you gotta learn them all, same as Pokemon GO players are catching them all, bad reference but whatever. Sometimes weapons and utility thingies can get stuck in certain places where you can't pick them, but that's pretty much it. The buy menu is very simple and clean, you know exactly what you're buying and getting. Newbies might be struggling at the beginning, but later when you get the hang of it, you'll be finding yourself purchasing everything you need for the specific round in a matter of seconds. Simply put, it has unique interaction mechanics that you also have to see for yourself to understand how these really work.[/b]

[h1][b]Final Score and Conclusion (86 out of 100)[/b][/h1]
[b]I've been playing CS:GO for several years now, but I've never found the time to write a proper review. Sometimes it gets so frustrating that you simply would like to delete it and never see it installed on your system again. But the truth is: you'll always find your way back in. I've made a few long pauses along the way, but there's no better competitive shooter out there that you can play instead of CS:GO and still find it enjoyable. One tip: don't queue in competitive matchmaking alone, it's a complete disaster. Also, don't buy expensive skins, they won't make you better.[/b]",True
1887,"Best shooting game for me ever. A lot of hackers, but you are able to choose to play in certain time to avoid them. Mostly they are high ranks in competitive mode.

1899,"[B]Introduction:[/B]
Counter Strike: Global Offensive is a multiplayer FPS game where you are either part of a Terrorist organisation or part of a team of Counter-Terrorists. The aim of the game is to work together with your team to defeat the opposing force. Even with many new maps, weapons and features, this game still has some classic maps and guns from the older Counter Strike games.

[B]Pros:[/B]
-Over 20 different weapons to choose from.
-Many game modes including casual, death match, arms race, competitive and more.
-Unique skins and possible drops at the end of each match.
-Operations that feature new community-made maps and skins.

[B]Cons:[/B]
-Trolls, hackers and smurfs can ruin a competitive match.
-In general, the game does not have a very friendly/kind community.
-Some in-game items/features can be quite costly.
-Competitive bans may last as long as a week.

[B]Overall:[/B]
CS:GO can be addictive at times and is a lot more fun when playing with friends. The graphics are nice and I personally enjoy the music/sounds. Communicating and working well with your team can be a huge advantage to the game, but there are those who prefer to stray away from the rest of their teammates and play by their own rules. My rating would be an 8.5/10.",True

1908,"LMAO LOLOLOL

When I use acronyms such as LOL or LMAO I use them not to express humor, but my crippling depression. They are a silent cry for help from this dark void of sadness. I used to use them genuinely, but as time went on I found myself meaning it less every time I used them. How many people actually laugh out loud when they say ""LOL,"" laugh their ass off when they say ""LMAO,"" and roll on the floor laughing when they say ""ROFL""? No one. This is the result of the pathetic world of lies we live in. As my depression grew stronger over the years I found myself questioning the true meaning of these acronyms when I used them. I decided they represent the mask of anonymous lies we live behind on the internet and since they are lies it makes sense that the user is experiencing the opposite emotion of what they actually express. I used these ""humorous"" acronyms on a layer of irony for several more years but no one noticed. No one paid attention to my wounded calls for help, my desperate cries for relief from this horrible life. I now seek to solve this problem on my own instead of relying on the cruel, heartless ""humans"" that dominate society today. Tonight I solve the problem once and for all, by ending my trial on the hell we call ""earth."" LMAO",True

Я играю в контру c 1999-го года. 20 лет, Карл. Для меня, это пожалуй, самый любимый мультиплеерный шутан. Вот как я впервые с ним познакомился:

Есть у меня друг Лёха и когда нам было по 9 лет, мы вдвоем ходили после уроков к нему домой, валиться в Эпоху Империй и другие хайповые игрухи тех времен (да, у Лёхи было 2 компа, так как его папка программист).  В один из дней, Лёха предложил побегать в новенькую стрелялку, название которой я узнал немного позднее. Да да, гайс, это была КСка, а если подробнее - мод для Half-Life. Лёха нон-стопом выигрывал у меня раунд за раундом, что естественно мотивировало меня к приобретению скилла, чтобы победить моего друга. У меня тоже был комп дома, однако его мощности не позволяли мне бацать в контру, поэтому апать свой скилл я ходил в компьютерный клуб. И так вот всё закрутилось и завертелось: полетели флешки, западал дропчик, рашились  мосты на ацтеке, ""Fire in the hole!"", ""еб*ать ты нуб"", ""юшечка полилась"" и еще сотни мемасов которые можно описывать бесконечно. 

Помню про стадии отторжения новых частей франшизы, когда тебе сперва не нравится Source, а потом ты не понимаешь как раньше мог жить без него и возвращаться в 1.6 уже как-то и не хочется. Та же история была у меня и с CSGO.  

Никогда не забуду видос телепередачи ""Намедни"", про поездку российской команды М19 на WCG 2002. Ковыряния в своем конфиге с целью улучшения игрового комфорта, реплеи с чемпионатов и улётные мувики с крышесносными килами под драйвовый музон.

Кска подарила мне незабываемые эмоции, новые знакомства и я до сих пор с удовольствием захожу в неё побегать в мой любимый соревновательный режим. Ван лав.

Lately my balls have been extremely itchy for some reason, so instead of itching them, i burn them with scalding hot water to relieve the itching and it is quite possibly the most amazing sensation i've ever felt in my life. It feels amazing and i'm doing less damage to the skin than if i were to scratch them. I just have to be careful because the hot water hitting my hand or my thighs hurts really bad so it can be difficult to only let the scalding hot water hit my nuts and nothing else. As i've been doing this, the itching has gotten less intense as the days go on so the treatment seems to be working.

I have been following the complete scene of this game and im back here to change something about my original review (that I have not modified and you can read it above).

Valve is listening to the community and they have been doing constant VAC ban waves.

Also they put some new system to prevent the immediately access in MatchMaking to the cheaters and smurfers (in this part i dont mind but for a lot of people is a issue, they are listening) 

Now i can say 8/10. Great game.

this game has evolved a lot:

[*]constantly updates, some really bad updates like music kits, graffiti sprays just to get more money BUT there is some other excelent updates like hitbox fixes, animations, maps updates, etc.

[*]A great try to keep cheaters annoyed to cheat in MM, the new prime system is a good attempt to delay cheaters. and without doubt this system has reduced the cheaters in MM if you use your prime account

1957,"Counter Strike Global Offensive is a game developed by Valve.
It is extremely difficult, considering you have to wrangle teammates, manage your economy, predict your enemies economy, buy the correct shit and then aim for the head and spray correctly.
Then there is a bunch of extra shit like grenades, objectives, utility and whatever the fuck not.
It's not a game for everyone, you have to be really good with your mouse.

There's a story that someone was so good with his mouse that he became the mouse.
The mouse permanently fused into his hand. Now he has to use his other hand for certain things.
The game has multiple maps, including dust 2 which is the only map, and Mirage. But mirage...really isn't working these days.
The game will bring you so many fun experiences, like playing a game with Aldon Hilter, as he only buys a Negev and politely refuses to buy anything else. As we lose 14-16, against 4 bots.
This game is fun: In the words of a certain person, this is fucking gameplay
You can play as the the terrorists, and blow shit up while praying to the one god, or you can play as the counter terrorists, who counter terrorists' terrorizing terrorism.
Some of the guns are: The deagle, the AK-47, the P90, the AWP, and most important and deadliest of all: the decoy grenade.

Not many people know that every decoy grenade is sent from the deepest circles of hell, where the souls of the damned are burned and seared alive for all eternity.
On your journey to become better at this game, you will encounter smurfs, non-bilingual Russians, toxicity, mute people, people who make you realize that CS:GO causes metaphysical retardation, or will at least make you consider that being true.
But the worst of all: people who type ""Nice Try"", after you fail your fucking shitty clutch attempt.

There are a lot of mods for the game, like bunny hopping servers, 1v1 servers, surfing servers, jailbreak and a lot of other stuff.
I almost forgot to mention the skins, every single gun can be cosmetically customized if you have the money. Every skin is different and has a different price, ranging from your generic pistol skin, to a 1600 dollar knife skin.

1982,"If you are an OSX user, this may not be for you. Continuous and spontaneous crashes and other issues (including your aim being locked and you are dropped to 20fps) ruin the competitive experience. The random crashes don't seem to be as common for PC users for whatever reason.
  
Recent updates to the Matchmaking system have now caused lower-ranked players (Silver and Gold Nova) to be continually matched with players with considerably more skill and experience, known as ""Smurfs"" to the community. While these ranking tweaks had good intentions, especially for highly-ranked players (Global Elite, SMFC etc.), they just seemed to amplify the smurfing problem to  a much greater extent. Smurfing ruins the competitive scene, especially for beginners and lower ranked players who have not yet been able to grow and learn to the extent of the experienced 'Smurfs'. While some may acclaim that Smurfing allows players to improve, by playing against players of greater skill, when you lose a gun battle to a smurf, round after round, you're forced to sit and spectate while you wait for the next round to begin. If you are most interested in watching the game instead of being able to play it, watching Professional CSGO tournaments might be your speed. It makes it hard to improve at the game when you are pummeled by a Smurf game after game, day after day.

Besides this all, the millions of daily players cannot be wrong. Gameplay is fluent and heavily based on cooperation with teammates. CSGO gives a motivation to improve, to climb the Matchmaking ranks and become the best player you can be. Even the weapon skins add  a huge element to the game that is purely about a virtual economy for aesthetic customisations in-game.

CSGO is an immersive experience, and is a great game to play with friends - a game to learn together and grow together to top the ranks of Competitive Matchmaking. However, every game has its flaws. Crashes, gameplay issues and smurfing are amongst the most heinous (and I haven't even touched on the cheaters). Overall, 400 hours of regular playtime speaks for itself, but major issues need to be addressed so that the game becomes more enjoyable for everyone, becomes a more competitive experience and the community can grow together in appreciation of the game.",True

1995,"[u][b]It's time for me to write my review of this game's gameplay ONLY after playing it for almost 1000 Hours[/b][/u]

[b]Note:[/b] I won't be writing about the skin , drop system. I will be only writing about the gameplay. I can't type perfect English so excuse me on that.

[b]Firstly[/b], Counter Strike Global Offensive is a game which will require individual skill , teamwork and good communication. When , I started playing Counter Strike Global Offensive , I was a guy who always like to do things solo and not give a crap about my teammates. I would just not listen to my team and just do whatever I want. Once I started learning more about Counter Strike Global Offensive , I started to reliease that this game will require patience as you need time to get better at your individual skill and not to get angry at your team if they are not following to your calls.

[b]Secondly[/b], Counter Strike Global Offensive has a handful of cheaters. Be physically and mentality prepared if you face a cheater on the enemy team. Don't start to rage as your mood will affect your gameplay , just play the game like there is no cheaters at all in that particular match.

[b]Thirdly[/b], I will recommend this game to people who wants to get better at FPS games as this game will help you in your individual skill and teamwork. You will also make more friends and you end up playing every competitive match with them. I give this game a 8/10 rating. ""Why not 10/10?"" , you might be asking. There is many cheaters on the loose and they not have been banned , that is the reason why I don't give this game a 10/10.

Finally , Good Luck and Have Fun if your planning to start playing this game. Hope this review has helped you if your planning to buy Counter Strike Global Offensive. If you have any questions , feel free to write down in the comment section and I will get back to you ASAP :)

It has the essential qualities of a Valve game that I love, which make it crazy fun and addicting. The only thing I could possibly hate is the community: cheaters, meh, but children and Russian people, French people etc. that pretend their country is the center of the world, literally everywhere you go... Very pretentious, so annoying.

If you find a good group of Americans to play with, and have friends in America to comp with you'll have a FANTASTIC time. This game is GREAT to play in ""Competitive"" mode with friends!

There's even fun to be had exploring custom maps. 

Bottom line, nothing beats a good 2004 era boom headshot, complete with a metal scraping sound to tap it off.

The competitive part of the gameplay is full with teamwork, skill and tactics, its nice that team with a leader (A guy that command his/her teamates via team chat or voice chat) will always win if they are against a team without a proper leader. Soo the teamwork in this game is very superb. All the weapons in this game is balanced, so no matter which gun you used, as long as you can used it, you can kill even an opponent with a more expensive gun than you, i see alot players with a 800$ weapon win against a players with a 5000$ weapon. And if you didn't like competitive you can have fun too with a Call of duty style team deathmatch, and free for all. Its really fun, all you need to do in this mode is to just kill the enemy, killing another players in this mode is really fun and a stress reliever.

Ingredients
Dough:
2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
4 teaspoons sugar
1/4 teaspoon fine salt
14 tablespoons cold butter, diced
1 large egg, lightly beaten with 2 tablespoons cold water
Filling:
2 tablespoons freshly squeezed lemon juice
3 pounds baking apples like Golden Delicious, Cortland, or Mutsu
2/3 cup sugar, plus more for sprinkling on the pie
1/4 cup unsalted butter
1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon
Generous pinch of ground nutmeg
1 large egg, lightly beaten
Copyright 2001 Television Food Network, GP. All rights reserved
Directions
Make the dough by hand. In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, and salt. Using your fingers, work the butter into the dry ingredients until it resembles yellow corn meal mixed with bean sized bits of butter. (If the flour/butter mixture gets warm, refrigerate it for 10 minutes before proceeding.) Add the egg and stir the dough together with a fork or by hand in the bowl. If the dough is dry, sprinkle up to a tablespoon more of cold water over the mixture.

Make the dough in a food processor. With the machine fitted with the metal blade, pulse the flour, sugar, and salt until combined. Add the butter and pulse until it resembles yellow corn meal mixed with bean size bits of butter, about 10 times. Add the egg and pulse 1 to 2 times; don't let the dough form into a ball in the machine. (If the dough is very dry add up to a tablespoon more of cold water.) Remove the bowl from the machine, remove the blade, and bring the dough together by hand.

Form the dough into a disk, wrap in plastic wrap and refrigerate until thoroughly chilled, at least 1 hour.

Make the filling. Put the lemon juice in a medium bowl. Peel, halve, and core the apples. Cut each half into 4 wedges. Toss the apple with the lemon juice. Add the sugar and toss to combine evenly.

In a large skillet, melt the butter over medium-high heat. Add the apples, and cook, stirring, until the sugar dissolves and the mixture begins to simmer, about 2 minutes. Cover, reduce heat to medium-low, and cook until the apples soften and release most of their juices, about 7 minutes.

Strain the apples in a colander over a medium bowl to catch all the juice. Shake the colander to get as much liquid as possible. Return the juices to the skillet, and simmer over medium heat until thickened and lightly caramelized, about 10 minutes.

In a medium bowl, toss the apples with the reduced juice and spices. Set aside to cool completely. (This filling can be made up to 2 days ahead and refrigerated or frozen for up to 6 months.)

Cut the dough in half. On a lightly floured surface, roll each half of dough into a disc about 11 to 12 inches wide. Layer the dough between pieces of parchment or wax paper on a baking sheet, and refrigerate for at least 10 minutes.

Place a rack in the lower third of the oven and preheat the oven to 375 degrees F.

Line the bottom of a 9-inch pie pan with one of the discs of dough, and trim it so it lays about 1/2 inch beyond the edge of the pan. Put the apple filling in the pan and mound it slightly in the center. Brush the top edges of the dough with the egg. Place the second disc of dough over the top. Fold the top layer of dough under the edge of the bottom layer and press the edges together to form a seal. Flute the edge as desired. Brush the surface of the dough with egg and then sprinkle with sugar. Pierce the top of the dough in several places to allow steam to escape while baking. Refrigerate for at least 15 minutes.

Bake the pie on a baking sheet until the crust is golden, about 50 minutes. Cool on a rack before serving. The pie keeps well at room temperature (covered) for 24 hours, or refrigerated for up to 4 days.

Cook's Note: You may freeze the uncooked pie, but don't brush it with egg or dust it with sugar beforehand. Place the pie in the freezer for 30 minutes, to harden it slightly, and then double wrap it with plastic wrap. Freeze for up to 6 months. When ready to bake, unwrap the pie and brush it with egg and sprinkle with sugar. Bake, from the frozen state, until golden brown, about 1 hour and 10 minutes.

 Im playing this game now for just too long to understand the core thinking of the makers of the game.
Sadly i have to give the game a thumbs up anyway because the thumbs up are maybe for the best 1st person shooting game of all time... i played them all fromcs begginings till now even COD, BF probably all versions till now. But i have to admitt all this games cannot top CS:GO. 
 
Cs is just a very fast, team oriented 1st person shooter that will pull you in and never let go...

Atleast what i thought so till now... Now i have to come to the problem... and the problem is:
--------------------------------------------------CHEATING---------------------------------------------------------------------
Since the game came out i knew there would be cheaters... It sadly now belongs to almost every online game there is... But this became different... Allredy at the beggining i was wondering about the price of the game ... found it kinda cheap for such a good game only 14 Euro or something... At that point i allready thougt that its kinda easy for cheaters to rebuy a new account even if they should get banned...
 But i could never ever even imagine that it gets even better untill i realized that its beeing sold atleast once a month for ca 3 Euro... I dont know if this is aa dream or a insult to all the players who want to play a clean game... i dont think i have to explain what consequences this had on cheating.... 

So because of that the complainments and reports pilled up and valve was searching for a solution that doesnt cost them a thing and they get the cheaters atleast a lil bit under controll... so they made OVERWATCH... now they dont have to pull a finger and they work is beeing done by slaves (Players) who are hoping on a cleaner game one day... 
Nice story but whats this the game costs 3 Euro again so this guy (Cheater) buys this time 6 accounts so he has resources now for atleast 4 months to play and cheat...

This is getting out of control VALVE you are making allready big money with this Skins and Market stuff why in Gods name cant you spent some of the money for making the game more enjoyable where you bann those cheaters and get us ----------------128-tick------------ SERVERS----------!!!!!!

2051,"Once again, Valve never fails to deliver an epic title such as Counter Strike. For years, the Counter Strike community was divided into two titles: Counter Strike: 1.6 and Counter Strike: Source. But now thanks to Valve's latest Counter Strike adition, we can finally bring back the family all together. The addition of skins are all bonuses that make Counter Strike: Global Offensive even more enjoyable, following Team Fortress 2's hat and drop system. The money being used for E-sports for the best to take place in. The competitive rank system that finally matches players equally based in terms of skill and tactic, as well as giving you the prestige for winning. The game is not perfect, but then again no game is. But what seperates most games from this one is the fact that the beloved developers of Hidden Path Entertainment are always listening to the fans while working together with the top players to try to achieve the perfect gameplay (although there are many features that could be similar to DOTA 2 to make it even better, but Valve will learn soon).

Then my friends told me about steam and after a while I found this game, Counter Strike: Global Offensive.
I was excited to play it, i played it everyday NONSTOP until i felt like going to sleep.

One day, I woke up and of course started playing cs go, I noticed what i have became...a csgo addict.
I didn't know what to do when i was thinking of that. I quickly shut off my computer and went outside for once. I thought about what i was thinking...I decided to go back inside, still trying to get it out of my head...""a csgo addict"". I started crying...I didn't know what to do. I couldn't stop playing now...I have only just begun. I looked at all the money i had left and wasted it on cs go skins. The addiction is growing. I couldn't stop it even if a tried, thats when i realized...that i have fully became a cs go addict.

2064,"After 2.5k hours, comings and goings and different tries in others FPS games, all I can say is that CSGO is the best first person shooter right now. 
In my opinion, the first rule is: don't play alone. Try to queue up with 4 friends and have a good time. Generally, the community is toxic and ruins your experience.
There are some points in the game that need serious improvements, for example:
- Better anticheat system
- 128tick servers
- An improved ranking system, maybe with more rewards that make the player actually play IN the csgo matchmaking and don't migrate to another competitive platform

In conclusion, CSGO is a very competitive game in wich you need to spend time to get rewarded in terms of skill. A sensation that is super worth it.

The simplicity with which one can begin playing allows almost everyone to play and enjoy the game. The details of the game, the same since the year 2000, bring such minute differences between the skilled and the amateur that the skill ceiling is nearly unreachable. The only  poor quality of this game is the toxicity of the players.

The 2 year and 2000hr summary; 

Pro – One of the most popular games on the steam network
Con – One of the most popular games on the steam network

Pro – Immersive, complex and highly teamwork dependent game. 
Con – The lobby system, the matchmaking system and general practice of  “alternate accounts” really tends to crap all over the above mentioned pros. 

Pro – Allot of cool stuff available to buy, trade, sell! The trading and marketplace really brings a whole new perspective to gaming while teaching us valuable real world lessons.
Con – With that being said, its almost impossible to not spend more money then the initial price. Getting tricked by scumbag traders, account hacked and your awesome stuff stolen are only the tip of cringe stories. Oh did I mention they are just skins with no function? :D

Conclusion: *smacks forehead* Look... The game is JUST OKAY. IT IS NOT the ultimate online pc shooter, but learning to play CAN BE TONS OF FUN with your friends. Hmm, whats this? Catch a little confidence? No worries!! Keep playing and the awesome CSGO community will be right there to rip it all to shreds and shove it back in your face. Cheers!

That's all.. You may catch a few laughs outta the sh*** I wrote in the past down below, but with this summary my review is now complete. 

Peace out. 

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

WOW... Just wow... Smurfs, Jerks and hackers! DO NOT PLAY THIS GAME COMPETETIVE IF YOU WANT TO HAVE FUN !!! (Unless, fun to you is getting aggravated, being yelled at for not playing good and not knowing everything about the game.) If you wish to gain a good rank, join a team who will help you get carried or boost you for money. As for ranking up as an individual the only way to do that, is to have friends who have the proper skills for a highly competitive gameplay and all you have to do is plant or defuse the bomb while they cover for you... You then learned nothing. :/ That makes it a TEAM GAME I guess. That way you can gain team points PER ROUNDS WIN and that is all !!! Kill / death ratio doesn't matter anymore, you are as GOOD or as CRAP as your team is. Level up with your friends or they will soon not play with you and you get stuck in what is referred to as ""silver hell."" Good luck getting out of that because, it means allot of headaches as these teams will consist of players who legit ""don't know what they are doing"" against players who purchased a secondary account and posses the seemingly PRO SKILLS you DO NOT when you're wanting to learn and get better at competitive gameplay. You'll just end up getting killed by them, your team will yell at you and you will suffer though a horrible loss, because you cannot abandon a match without receiving a ""cooldown time"" an you will learn NOTHING!!! These highly skilled players with secondary low rank accounts are so called ""smurfs."" They are a form of cyberbullies who like stroke their own d***ks while they play against inexperienced players who are trying to figure out how to play better. All the while smurfs are calling you names, aggravating you and causing team moral to drop. Soon your whole team is yelling at you and practically forcing you to quit and once again you learned nothing... Do yourself a favor and don't pay for mental anguish! GLHF! (Good luck, have fun. Which this game is neither!)

-----Update 1------
Yes, a bit of clearing up is need even if this review is long enough as is. 

One part I agree with Pete, the casual and deathmatch modes are flooded, where the competitive side is strictly teams of 5 v 5. 

As in how to deal with smurfs and hackers is not that straightforward. No one plays comp to purposely loose. (Unless you're trolling or want to derank your account.. but why!?) 
Face it, loosing sucks but specially when item drops have also been reduced to nothing and when they do they are items that are in extremely bad condition and worth only a few cents. Then the only way to battle the smurfs is to have friends who are willing to teach you the game. That way when you pull together as a team, utilize your grenades well, pay attention to positioning and aim, you will have a fighting chance because usually the smurf is the last one or two player(s) alive. Only then it could be made into a monster! :D

Good luck and (try to) have fun!

----Update 2-----

Thanks for all the responses everyone!

The rank and matchmaking system is for the lack of a better word, is bonkers! :D

I actually enjoy helping new players with tips and hints on getting better. It's just something I've gotten to a great liking of eversince leading the CS:S division of a multigaming clan back in those days.

One other thing recently occurred to me while playing CS:GO, is that hours played and kill / death ratio should also come into factor.

For instance, when I started out in CS:GO I was invited to comp matches by friends who are in the range of Nova-2 to Master Guardian ranks. I've quickly received my Silver Master Elite rank, which I went onto advance into the mid Nova range. Solo queing and just general messing around (once the game was an inevitable loss) I have managed to derank my account to the mid silver range. 

I keep performing in the mid range of the score board also, but its by choice because I've came to accept the fact that its going to take me a reeaallyy long time to gain my nova ranks back. When I'm asked to pull it together its not hard for me to get kills, give good strats and sometimes even start to carry my team.
I just cant help but be frustrated when I do constantly perform good and is top mvp and every 10 game or more still not budge a rank.

GLHF, but most importantly HAVE FUN because that's up to each and every one of us to enjoy the game even if its a bit broken!",True
2091,"I highly recommend CS:GO , Counter-Strike:Global Offensive to all my friends because of the low price and the high replayability. With just this cheap game you will be able to play 10 times the time you normzlly spend on a triple A (AAA).
I like they spend equal importance on the individual skill as they do on the team play. For me, this is the only real tactical shooter on the market at this moment.
I like the high variety of maps and weapons and that they dont stop updating it with new operations wich offer new free maps and the ability to support the developers by buying these expansions (wich is totally unnecesary to be able to fully enjoy the game).
Theres not only a casual matchmaking but also a competitive matchmaking for people who take the game more serious. Theres weapon skins to collect and trade and cases to open to try ur luck. This game litteraly has everything an fps needs and fps fanatics want.",True

2098,"This is my Review on Counter Strike: Global Offence:
Pros:
- Great game if your willing to sit down for up to 90 minutes and have an even skill matched game.
- Will run well on most Computers
- Fast matchmaking when searching for a game
- Great if you have a group of friends to play with
- Provides many Hours of Entertainment

Cons: 
- Many Pre-Pubesent children in games that make it hard to enjoy Deathmatch/Casual
- Try-hard players in most games who will flame you if you let the team down, even in the slightest way
- ""Smurf"" players in most low rank competitive games, they side the whole match to the team that they're on, which leads to a very boring and frustraighting competitive game.
- Hackers in many games, most of the time they get dealt with quickly, but some slip through.
- Easily get banned from competitive matchmaking for stupid reasons, for example i recently recieved a 24 hour ban for voting yes to kick an AFK player on my team.

It does seem like the cons are overwelming, but this is from my experience. I have also had allot of fun and met lots of great people, try it out yourself and see what you think. Personally i think it is worth the $10 USD, thanks for reading, sorry for the spelling errors and the incorrect grammar.",True
2099,"Death is a great teacher. Failure in Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is, as it always has been for this series, the greatest way to learn where you should have gone, what you shouldn't have done, and how you could have done better. Counter-Strike players spend a lot of time learning -- consequently, they are always getting better.

Growth is an important factor in Global Offensive, especially if you're coming into Counter-Strike fresh or after a sabbatical. This is an extremely hardcore, skill-based first-person shooter, and it forces you to think differently than other modern shooters. If you’re a Call of Duty player, you’re going to need to change your play style to succeed here. Counter-Strike also tries developing into something new here as well, despite doing little to push itself beyond what it’s always done best. Global Offensive modifies old maps to keep veterans on their toes, and introduces official new modes that encourage different play styles for the first time in almost 15 years.

For the uninitiated, Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is a small-scale, team-based first-person shooter with permanent death. When a counter-terrorist kills a terrorist planting explosives in a classic Defusal match, or a CT escort swallows a sniper round in Hostage Rescue, the victim is dead for good and doesn't respawn until the next round. As such, players on both sides must exercise skill and care. The bomb objective, meanwhile, gives everyone a purpose. Of course matches end when everyone on a team is dead, but a clever and coordinated terrorist team will give the CTs the slip, plant their bomb, and protect the bomb site. Between rounds, everyone spends earned cash on better gear and guns, and the cycle continues.

Pieces of the Counter-Strike formula are dated at this point, but the superb heart and soul of Global Offensive is timeless. Teams are small, guns are lethal, and rounds are short. There's an addictive just-one-more-round quality to it, because there's a constant desire to do better than last time, to earn a satisfying kill, or to win in a new way. Call of Duty and Battlefield vets will wonder why they can't sprint to escape enemy fire or look down the iron sights to improve aim; Counter-Strike players will feel like they walked into their redecorated home. Certain map redesigns will catch hardcore fans off guard, but the changes are for the best -- the underpass choke point in de_dust, for instance, has a new escape route.

Even in the face of genre evolution, Global Offensive doesn’t care to adapt. CSGO is so dedicated to Counter-Strike's aging ideals despite market and trend changes that it brute-forces its way to success. Part of what makes it such an engaging competitive game is that killing in Global Offensive requires a wholly different skill set than other shooters. Everyone is limited to what they have and can see, with little room for character modification or on-the-fly advantages. Running and gunning is a useless play style, even if you've bought a helmet and kevlar that round, to the point that someone standing still is more likely to score the kill. Walking, crou
ching, or standing are your best bets to reduce the inaccurate spray of machine-gun fire.

Consequently, killing in Global Offensive feels good. There's a sickening sensation to dropping someone dead because you know they're not coming back. It's also satisfying knowing you used limited resources to play smarter than your victim. If players aren't watching corners, providing covering fire, or using smoke grenades and flashbangs, they're more likely to take a headshot from a more delicate and patient triggerman. The desire to experience that distinct feeling is a strong motivator to keep playing, even when you're getting steamrolled by an obviously better team.

If you've played Counter-Strike before, Global Offensive probably sounds a whole lot like Counter-Strike. Like Counter-Strike: Source before it, Global Offensive exists simply to modernize the look of the classic competitive shooter, while doing little to disrupt the core form and function. At the same time, it does enough to color outside the lines of tradition to justify your time and effort.
Fire is one of the most interesting new combat variables. Molotov cocktails and incendiary grenades either roast groups of guys or force them in another direction. Flames are a useful distraction or scare tactic, too. They're particularly useful during Demolition matches, which focus the fight at a single bomb site rather than giving terrorists two to pick between. The new and modified maps in this mode aren't as big as classic Counter-Strike arenas – entire sections have been cut off to direct teams toward a central location – but their thoughtful design is as intricate as ever. The Lake map is a standout -- there's a wide open yet densely populated yard around the bomb site, which is inside a sizable lakeside home with plenty of vantage points and hiding spots. To separate Demolition from Defusal, players can't buy between rounds. Instead, it takes a cue from the other new mode, Arms Race, in which each kill unlocks another weapon instantly. The better you do, the more you have to switch up the way you play, and because Demolition is so fast you'll need to be quick on your feet.",True
2100,"A fun and satisfying experience. Every kill you make online is satisfying and winning rounds is truly delightful. There are guns o' plenty allowing for many different playstyles. Snipers, shotguns, rifles, etc. And the best thing of all... CRATES! CRATES! CRATES! CRATES! CRATES! CRATES! CRATES! CRATES! CRATES!

2111,"I played CS from 1.5 - started out when I was 12 or 13 I believe. Played 1.6 for years, went to live events and was by far my favorite game to play and watch. I remember the WCG in 2006 with Sweden vs Poland and how much I just loved the game. Eventually like everything, scene slowly died and between one thing and another stopped playing. In November of 2014 I wanted to give a shot at my favorite old FPS - which now was ""CS:GO"". Downloaded, tried it. At first I wasn't fully convinced due to the fact that I haven't played CS in ages and I was still used to 1.6, however - with some more time I started to like it. Watched Dreamhack final 2014, LDLC vs NiP and was glad to see familiar faces I knew from 1.6 like f0rest and get_right. I got hooked up once again and now it's for sure my favorite game yet again.

There are some major things that need to be fixed like hitboxes, planting hitboxes, jumping hitboxes and ladder hitboxes. Valve needs to add 128 tick servers for match-making games and we need way more stats and in-depth graphs of our own performance on our profiles. Some weapon still needs some tweaking (AWP got nerfed too hard, hafl-way from now and older AWP would be perfect) and some pistols are still a bit too OP. All and all tho, even with these problems it's still a great game - however, if in the long run Valve doesn't take care of these major things and just keeps up the cosmetic side of CSGO I can see the community getting pissed in the long run, but they're smart so hopefully it won't happen.

Overall I give this game a 8/10 - that could be a 9/10 if they fixed the hitboxes/weapons and a  10/10 if we had 128 tick servers and more analysis.

Cheaters are a HUGE problem of this game, so I also hope that Valve would seriously expand the VAC team. I stopped playing mm for this reason now mostly 10mans and faceit.",True

2113,"Human immunodeficiency virus infection / acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS) is a disease of the human immune system caused by infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).[1] During the initial infection, a person may experience a brief period of influenza-like illness. This is typically followed by a prolonged period without symptoms. As the illness progresses, it interferes more and more with the immune system, making the person much more likely to get infections, including opportunistic infections and tumors that do not usually affect people who have working immune systems.

HIV is transmitted primarily via unprotected sexual intercourse (including anal and oral sex), contaminated blood transfusions, hypodermic needles, and from mother to child during pregnancy, delivery, or breastfeeding.[2] Some bodily fluids, such as saliva and tears, do not transmit HIV.[3] Prevention of HIV infection, primarily through safe sex and needle-exchange programs, is a key strategy to control the spread of the disease. There is no cure or vaccine; however, antiretroviral treatment can slow the course of the disease and may lead to a near-normal life expectancy. While antiretroviral treatment reduces the risk of death and complications from the disease, these medications are expensive and have side effects. Without treatment, the average survival time after infection with HIV is estimated to be 9 to 11 years, depending on the HIV subtype.[4]",True

2130,"CS:GO is probably one of the best multiplayer shooters out there, it offers such great gameplay and wide variety of gamemodes and maps to choose from. Counter-Strike has been around since 1999, and has grown since then. CS:GO may not please every 1.6 fan, but it has a lot to offer to the Counter-Strike scene. It has official competitive matchmaking, and supports the eSports scene of Counter-Strike. Most Counter-Strike major tournaments are hosted by GOTV and other sources like Twitch (which you can find on the main menu). It offers a ton of new gamemodes you made of heard before like ""Arms Race,"" (AKA Gun Game) and ""Deathmatch,"" (An all out Free-for-all). These gamemodes make Counter-Strike more friendlier to the casual players of the game. The old gamemodes are back in the modes Casual and Competitive. Casual is mostly for pub servers because it offers a more casual experience to the standard Counter-Strike gametypes like de_ (Bomb defusal) and cs_ (Hostage rescue) by turning off team-killing, always buy the essential equipment like Defusal kits and head armor. In the Competitive gamemode, it brings out the standard Counter-Strike competitively accepted settings. (some are modified like: Bomb time not being 35 seconds and instead being 45) This gamemode is for people who want to queue up with their friends and have a serious match with other players in competitive. Team-killing is allowed and many other hardcore settings to please the competitive audience. You might say to yourself, [i]""Well, since teamkilling is on, doesn't that mean people can grief in competitive?""[/i] Valve has implemented ways to stop griefers and trolls from ruining the game experience. Everytime you team-kill someone, you get a competitive ban that can go up to 7 days, and even a year, which means you can not play the competitive gamemode for how long it lasts! Valve also has its own community Overwatch service, which detects cheaters and griefers. Overwatch lets you watch competitive games and see if someone is griefing or not. The Overwatcher determines if the person is griefing or hacking. Then, the report gets send to Valve for a final confirmation. This has helped the CS:GO community get rid of hackers and griefers off of the competitive scene. Speaking of the community, the CS:GO community is pretty friendly when it comes to new players. Most veteran players are willing to help out to teach everyone the basics of the game if they are having trouble. Many guides on the steam community guide page teaches new players on how to handle weapons and such.

2137,"Every-time this game goes on sale something inside of me dies.
Thinking ( Here comes more hackers and smurfs ) 
494,368 in game right now which is the highest peak it ever reached until now.
EDIT : Now its 595,439


Anyway Csgo is a great game.
I mean if you don't know any of the counter-strike series thats really bad because you have to, it is the basic fps game out there.

In csgo it is even more fun and much more in-depth than Counterstrike:source.
More modes more maps, and matchmaking systems and customize-able skins.

I'v had a few people who don't know it thinking you buy better weapons with money.
Nope all players same weapons just different colors ( Skins ) Thats all 

But the sad part of the game is having a lot of hackers, everytime it goes on sale = more and more hackers.

Well that said you can play a lot of games without encountering one and just having some fair maps.
But at ( Competitive ) mode you are most likely to encounter more hackers than you can count because thats the ranked mode in the game.

Anyway, My favorite Fps on steam, I Loved Source so much but after getting into Global offensive i dont see myself trying source ever again.

Also in this game you get weapon drops after finishing maps ( Random drops ) so you can trade/sell on market and gain some money, I got about 89$ from selling those stuff.

good for people who wants to waste all their time on an FPS and still get something out of it.",True

2148,"CS;GO is old, like really old. But what makes it special is the community behind the game:

You definitely will get tired of normal matchmaking and normal deathmatch/casual, but the way the game is made allows you to have more fun than just the core gamemodes. Valve let's coders make their own gamemodes.

Want to spice up your matchmaking 5v5? Go faceit/ESEA/5E
Want to get better at aiming? Browse the hundreds of community aim training maps.
Want to just play awp only? Hop on AWP-only servers
Want to become Niko-level deagle players? Hop on Deagle-HS servers
Want to backstab your friends and lie your way out? You can play TTT
Want to play Jailbreak like you did in minecraft? Well you can look for jailbreak servers
Want to play zombie gamemode in CSGO? Look for Zombie Escape servers as they tend to be chaotic but fun
... and much more!

You see? CS:GO isn't a perfect game, nor is it in anyways better than a lot of AAA titles these days. However, it's how customizeable and crazy CSGO can get when the community gets access to developing and sourcemod. 

I would definitely recommend this game.",True

2155,"Game is overall a great game depending on many factors, which i will go over in this review. To start with this isn't a game you can just jump into and be #1, it takes a lot of practice, time and commitment. Overall i've played this game for 6,167+ hours combined between my multiple accounts. I have personally loved this game for what it has to offer and have always been a fan of the game-mode and the genre of the game.

I will be going over the positives and negatives in this review as well as summing it up at the end with my overall thoughts and opinions. I will admit this game isn't for the light hearted, as the community is a fairly toxic but also pleasant community. I have made many friends but also dealt with a lot of childish players within this game. You will be able to make friends quite easily and play with them constantly making it easier to rank up as your playing with people you can communicate with rather then random people.

There are a few key points to this game that make it amazing those are, team work, communication, skill, knowledge and memory. Team work is a vital part of this game and is what makes it amazing, it's a lot harder to win when you aren't playing as a team, any great team requires great communication, communication is an important part, as well as knowing what to call and when to call it. This game requires some skill, at the higher levels a lot more skill. This doesn't necessarily mean you need to be the best, as there are ranks in competitive for a reason to assign you to people in similar ranks, although there are smurfs and cheaters as with any competitive game. Knowledge and memory go together, can't have one without the other in this game, you need to be knowledgeable in how to peek, where to peek, how to peek together and more similar situations, to top it off you also need good memory in where to smoke, how to smoke certain positions, as well as flashbangs and other utilities.

In saying that, that is mainly only the competitive side of this game, there are many other amazing features offered in this game, those being community servers, arms races, demolition, casual and other gamemodes. This game has a lot to offer, in particular one of my favourite parts of this game is the community servers, you have surf servers, and game servers, making it a game for everyone.

If you are feeling like taking your gaming to the next level i would highly recommend this game, there are many leagues to join i.e FaceIT and similar. There is also the pro scene which many make it to in different divisions, this allows for the best of the best to play for cash and other rewards.

This game has no real pay to win features besides when the game requires you to now pay for prime, which is totally worth it! There are skins, but those do not have any advantage besides player models which can make it harder to see the person which is playing.

Now i will give you all a lovely bullet point list of what this has to offer quickly ran down with negatives and positives below:

The Negatives:
1) The Community - This will be featured in both areas, as it is a downfall and a positive, the community can be quite toxic but also quite welcoming.
2) Learning Curve - There is a learning curve for this game, so don't expect to jump in and be rambo.
3) The Cheaters - This comes with any game, but in this game there is a chance you will run into cheaters quite frequently.

The Positives:
1) Amazing Game - This game is always going to be a top game and very popular at that.
2) Requires Co-operation - This game i personally enjoy for the fact it requires the team to work as a team.
3) Fun Combat - The guns have recoil patterns to learn, getting a good one tap is quite fun. Overall combat is a great aspect of this game.
4) Top Selling Game - This game is a top selling game for a reason, allowing all sorts of players from all over to play an amazing FPS.

If you are looking for a game to have some fun then this is the game for you, aslong as you know what your in for. Hope you all have a lovely day and keep on fragging!",True

It's a very rewarding game that gives you satisfaction to play, especially when you're with teammates who work together. I've met a lot of friends over this game and its various game modes, whether it was Danger Zone, Comp or just any other game mode I que with. It's a very fun game to play with friends, but will make you angry if you play by yourself. 

It's also very fun to grind and try to rank up. It gives you a sense of accomplishment. Very rewarding. My only gripe I really have with this game is that there is a REALLY bad cheater problem. Whether the person is being very subtle with the cheating or going all out, it's a really big problem. I know Valve is trying to counter the cheaters as best they can, but it really is annoying trying to play and your enemies are just going all out with the cheating.

[h1]Counter-Strike: Global Offensive Review[/h1]
[i]Counter-Strike: Global Offensive (CS:GO) is a game developed by Valve. It was released on 21 Aug, 2012. It is the most played game on Steam. [/i]

[b][h1]Gameplay: [/h1][/b]
[i]In every game mode, you can either be a Counter Terrorist (CT) or a Terrorist (T). If you choose to play as a terrorist, your main objective would be to either kill all the CTs, or plant the bomb and don’t let the CTs defuse it. On the other hand, if you choose to play as the Counter Terrorists, your main objective would be to kill all the terrorists, or defuse the bomb, which is possible only if they have planted it. These are the objectives of the normal game mode. There are hostage maps in which the CTs have to rescue the hostages or kill the opponents to win and terrorists have to stop the CTs from rescuing the hostages from the grip of the Terrorists or kill all the terrorists in order to achieve victory. On the other hand, the Terrorists should ensure that all the hostages stay as hostages and they can also attain victory by killing all the counter terrorists. There are many other maps in the game. The most commonly played ones are the Dust II and Mirage.

You can buy different weapons and other equipments at the beginning of each and every round. These purchases are made by using the money which is given to you whenever you successfully kill an enemy and at the end of each round. Winning the current round will grant you more money and vice versa. You have access to a huge collection of weapons, from handguns and SMGs to High Calibre Sniper Rifles and Heavy Machine Guns. Your starting loadout will always be a pistol and a knife and that’s why this round is known as the pistol round. All weapons have a different amount recoil and a lot of time is needed to learn to control it. Accuracy is key.

Teamwork is key in this game. You need to have good communication with your allies since the game is solely dependant on strong teamwork. Proper team work mixed with coordination and communication increases your team’s odds of winning
[/i]

[b][h1]Graphics: [/h1][/b]
[i]The graphics are good for a competitive game. Mid Spec PCs can easily run the game. The weapons and character models look great and you can easily spot the enemies. Low end PCs can play lighter maps like Mirage. All the maps have different themes and are designed by giving importance to the point of time when both the teams meet. Overall, the graphics of the game won’t bore you.[/i]

[b][h1]Modes: [/h1][/b]
[i](Note: All the game modes explained below can be played in a lobby with friends.)

[b]Casual:[/b] You can choose if you want to be a CT or a T and you can change the team any time during the game. The length of this game mode is short and the first team to win 8 rounds wins. Recommended for players who are new to the game.

[b]Deathmatch:[/b] The length of this game mode is 10 minutes and you instantly respawn after you get killed. You can play with any weapon you want. The player with the highest score in the end wins the game.

[b]Wingman:[/b] This mode offers a 2v2 game. There is a team switch in the middle of the game and this mode has a separate rank, which is displayed on your profile once you have won 10 wingman games.

[b]Competitive: [/b]This is a 5v5 competitive game mode which has different maps, specific for his mode. This mode also has a separate ranking system which is displayed on your profile, once you have won 10 competitive games. Only play casual games for a while before playing this mode.

[b]Danger Zone: [/b]The 18 player battle royale mode of the game. Collect different guns and weapons and be the last man standing to win the game. Choose your spawn location in the starting of the game and collect money which can be used to order weapons. 

[b]Arms Race: [/b]In arms race mode, killing two enemies will upgrade your weapon to the next level and the first player to reach the golden knife level and kill someone with the knife will win. You instantly respawn after you die.

[b]Demolition: [/b]The game mode is similar to casual mode but the only twist is, you need to kill enemies to upgrade your weapon. Terrorists will win if they eliminate the enemy team or if the bomb explodes and CTs will win if they defuse the bomb or eliminate the enemy team.

[b]Flying Scoutsman:[/b] You only have the weapon named SSG08 (or Scout) and a knife. The gravity is reduced and a single jump will send you to a great height. The accuracy of the weapons is also increased.

[b]Workshop Maps:[/b] There are different workshop maps created by the community. Some popular map genres include the 1v1 maps, aim maps, Co-op maps etc. You only need to subscribe to a map from the workshop and you can play it in game. [/i]

[b][h1]Extra Info: [/h1][/b]
[b]Prime and Non-Prime: [/b]
[i]You earn XP after completing a match in any mode (except workshop maps) which increases your private rank. After you reach level 21 you get the “Prime Status”. Prime matchmaking has less cheaters. Non-prime matchmaking have a lot of cheaters, so new players might have a bad experience. You can also buy the Prime status upgrade from the steam store to instantly get access to prime maps. [/i]

[b]Tips to new players: [/b]
[i]If you cannot buy the prime status, just don’t play competitive until you attain it. The non-prime competitive matches are filled with cheaters. Also, while playing competitive, give calls after you die and only use SMGs in the beginning. P90 is the best option. You can practice your aim in some workshop maps first. Strictly avoid reloading your gun immediately after killing an enemy if you have some bullets left, this is a common mistake done by most of the new players.[/i]
[b][h1]Pros And Cons:[/h1][/b]
[b]Pros: [/b] [list]
[*]Great graphics.
[*]All modes can be played with friends.
[*]Frequent updates. [/list]

[b]Cons:[/b] [list]
[*]So many cheaters. Especially in Non Prime.
[*]Bad Matchmaking system.
[*]Hard to learn.
[*]Too many toxic people.
[*]While using snipers, if you jump and try to noscope an enemy, the bullet will go in some other direction instead.
[*]Bad anti-cheat system. [/list]

[b][h1]Overall Rating:[/h1][/b]
[i]The game is pretty good but the bad anti-cheat system and the large number of cheaters ruin the game. [/i]

CSGO is a near-perfect multiplayer shooter. Unlike the previous versions, which were often difficult to get in to, this one offers a variety of modes that will appeal to all skill levels. It has a large community and a well supported workshop, ensuring that this discount-priced game will be around for years to come.

In short, you either play as the good or bad guys and must either kill the other team or complete objectives to win the round, which will earn you more money to do the same thing again but faster. It's been around for years and has spawned many imitators.

The game isn't much of a looker as it is based on the same engine as the original Half Life 2 was. However, Valve have polished it as much as they can and the community consists of lots of awesome mappers who have been churning out brilliantly imaginative and beautiful maps almost on a daily basis.

Is it worth getting if you already own Counter Strike: Source? Yes. CSS was always Counter Strike shoe-horned into the Source engine. CSGO feels far more like a standalone game. Valve have very carefully listened to what people have wanted and have made a very appealing game. The best feature must be the competitive play, where you play 10 games that you cannot leave (unless you want to tarnish your reputation), after which you'll be ranked and will be paired up with people of the same skill, meaning that the game is challenging but fair no matter what skill level you are.

There are all kinds of teams and communities that you can join. Really, if I was stuck on a desert island with one game this would most likely be my top choice. It's bigger than you can hope to conquer and has a huge community around it which will likely be around for years to come, something that can't be said for the Call of Duty franchise which is probably its closest rival. Remember that those games are full price and have another one churned out each year, fragmenting the community. Plus you can customise your weapon skins in CSGO. Surely that's the most important feature?! All they need to add now are hats and you might as well live in CSGO.

Hackers, 
Unbalanced guns, 
Somewhat broken MM Ranking system,

The game also is not updated often, and usually the updates end up being complete garbage bringing more broken gameplay.

Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, is a popular online Action Game and First-Person Shooter for the PC.

[h1] Gameplay [/h1]

Counter Strike Global Offensive is the best Counter Strike game yet and the most lucrative one, as far as tournament players are concerned. If I didn’t know any better, I would rate it as high as the original, but the truth is that Counter Strike 1.6 made a tremendous impact as a first-person shooter. Global Offensive is a great game, perhaps the best we could expect from the fourth sequel.

2281,"What amazes me about this game is the special ambience the player lives while playing the game consciously. It's not just a random FPS game that's about shooting the adversaries randomly, as it requires subliminal reactions and reflexes. The simplicity of the game makes the gamer focus more on the precision of his shots and actions than on the graphics (although the graphics are acceptable) and on the rest of the petty details.
Blatantly, the game was thoughtfully developed by the brave developers, who are still working on the game till nowadays, and are still considering the complaints of players and working on improving the gameplay to satisfy everybody. 

In the other hand, there are many hackers that are still there ruining everybody's gameplay. I can't deny that Valve is doing its best trying to get rid of these ashamed creatures but however they're still getting away with it. 

This game is a great successful accomplishment to the developers of Valve, despite of the cheaters who're trying to ruin this success and are definitely failing to do so. *ProTo tips the hat*

2308,"CSGO has been a huge impact on my life. Everyday after i got home from a tough day at school i always open up csgo and have some fun with my friends to get rid all of my suicidal thoughts! or not.

For a first-person shooter game, CSGO is one of the best game you can find out there for this genre. The graphic was okay, you could even run csgo with a microwave! Seriously tho it is that runable (Despite me having a slow computer.) The gameplay is similliar to every fps game out there, you got paired with a 5 man team trying to win the round if you are the terrorist you gotta plant the bomb and guard it until it blows up, if you are ct then you have to prevent that from happening! 

Tho that is not the only types of gamemode you will get from csgo, you have deathmatch, hostage rescue and alot of gamemode that is built by the community! You can always try to play everything eventually till you got burntout. If you're having a difficulty on winning in a competitive match you could go to a community server and have fun without having to worry about your rank. 

Despite all of that CSGO has an absolute shit community. You'll meet various of ""weird"" players coming from all around the world. I'd recommend you to play with your friends if you are planning to do a competitive match otherwise theres a big chance of you getting paired with a salty ass player that nags all the time and blame everything on the team for not doing what he wants. But that doesnt hide the possibility of you meeting a friendly player, but most of the time you'll meet a shit teammate instead (from my experience). So having a premade team with your friends is the best way to play the competitive gamemode. 

The ranking system is quite awful too. We dont know how the elo system works because the elo is not shown in the game. We dont have a single clue when are we going to rank up or how losing a game would affect the elo. So we are playing with a blindfold hoping that we will eventually rank up somehow.

Not to mention CSGO might turn you into some sort of gambler. Gambling/betting/buying skins or kinfe is what makes csgo as it is today. If your age is rather young you might have not aware of the consequences when doing all of the thing i mentioned above so if you're reading this review, i suggest to not waste your money on skins/knives but at the end of the day, its up to you.

I may not be the best at reviewing videogames since this is my first time ever doing so, i'd like to thank you for reading this bullcrap! Back to the main reason on why i made this review is do i recommend this game? Well if you're a diehard fans of first-person shooting game this might be the game for you, but for those of who arent? Still, i'd recommend this game because this game is enjoyable regardless of your taste in games

tl;dr 
csgo is gud

2333,"To the uninitiated: 

Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is hitting an upward stride in the modern military competitive shooter world for good reason. Partially due to its strengths, but also I’d argue (not here), due to the state of the game industry. There’s little reason to be a PC gamer and shooter fan and be clueless to this juggernaut. If you have even a bit of try-hard in you and a bit of skill, I’d highly advocate absorbing CS:GO like a sponge and saying goodbye to any other shooter you previously thought was relevant. I could go on and on about the honed balance structure; from the economy, to the maps, to the weapons; all asymmetrically tilted to empower skill and enable strategy. But I won’t. Take my word for it, it’s as close to perfect as I’ve seen a game get. Don’t get me wrong, I can nitpick some things; a few minor fringe gun complaints, 64 tick servers instead of 128 tick, but their patch performance at least shows overall that they’re on the right track. The chief of these points being restructuring maps to play better competitively (something I can’t remember seeing in any other competitive fps, ever, maybe in the UT Quake days idk). 

BUT! There’s a good chance you already knew of this legend. You’ve heard the fanboyish cries of devotion and likely thought to yourself “Why the hell would someone pay $150 for a gun skin”?! The game is that good… when you get into the competitive aspect. 

HOWEVER! I must say for a casual player, especially one who has little to no interest learning competitive, there’s not much here for you. There are casual modes, but they’re hard to enjoy knowing more light and care-free shooters are out there to play instead. The casual side of CS:GO is functional and passable, but it’ll feel like owning a Ferrari and only driving it in first gear, you’re really not getting the potential out of the product. But who am I to judge? Perhaps you’ll get into the gun skin craze too and play the casual modes and have a blast! I doubt it, but hell the game is cheap and goes on practically-free sales every time we turn around, so why the hell are you reading this? Just buy the thing! All the cool kids are doing it!

2337,"Most of the steam population owns this game so I’m unsure on why I need to write a review on it, but I am.

I brought Counter-Strike: Global Offensive when it was on sale because I was unsure if I would enjoy it due to the fact I was a huge Call of Duty fan boy XD. This game has its pros and cons over shooters but in my eyes, it'll be one of the best.

I am not high up in the rankings that being only Master Guardian 1 but I’ll do my best to explain why I personally enjoy;

Pros:
 - Movement - The movement is good because you don’t walk too fast or too slow and the speed at which you’re moving is related to the item which you have in your hands.
 - Bullet patterns - Bullet patterns are good because it is different to all the shooters that I have played on my Xbox and PC; this is because it takes skill and time to learn all the patterns to get better and it is just a point and shoot.
 - Ranking system - The ranking system is good because it lets you play against people that are at a similar skill set to you, making it an even match (Unless there is a smurf)
 - Skins - Skins are nice because it gets the community involved in the game, also it lets us, the user, customise our guns to best suit us
 - Maps -  All the maps are well created and thought out and none are too big or too small to the point where its constant fire
 - Age - This game was created at the perfect stage of shooters, any later and you will be flying around. It is a classic boot on the ground somewhat realistic shooter.

Cons:
 - Some of the people - This isn’t the games fault, but in every game, there will also be 1 or a small group of salty, toxic people or just ruin the experience for us. They don’t like it because you or someone else is having a good game and it’s all working out for them and the other person is having a bad one and they keep messing up and somehow it’s your fault… XD
 - Graphics - This graphics are still relatively good and Valve are doing their best by remaking some of the maps to keep up with the times but they are just always a little behind, this is just due to the fact it is a 5+ year old game and if they make a large change it would change the way the whole game plays and ruin the experience for everyone.
 - Active duty map selection - The maps which are in the Active Duty selection map are good and are fan favourites but I would like to see a Hostage map in there just to see how it would change the Pro games and a large portion of competitive play.

I quit this game because i realised it was bad for me, i had become obsessed with climbing to the next rank, getting the next achievement, opening just one more crate. It was pretty bad at my lowest of lows. So why am i giving this game a positive review? While the game has definitely changed since i last played it, what it was, for a while, was magical. Queuing up with my friends, meeting some new random people i ended up friending and speaking to maybe 1 or 2 more times. At its core, the fun of this game was not opening a crate and getting a new rare skin, or finally being able to leave Silver 1, or even pulling off that clutch nobody in your team thought you would be able to do. The fun of this game was the friends we made along the way, as corny as that sounds. As im clearing out my inventory of all my skins and finally moving on, i thought it would be right to come back here and give one final review to a game that was a large part of my teens. Though it has evolved and changed beyond what i once played and once enjoyed, i hope the spirit that i felt when playing the game is still there.

2388,"I came to the party pretty late. Almost 5 years or more after this game has had been released. So I can’t really say much about the game’s evolution over the course of this time.

Ok, so now to my review of the game, breaking it into smaller bits to highlight all the pros and cons about its different aspects. This is meant as much for those currently playing the game as it is for the uninitiated. So here we go!

Casual gaming in CS:GO:
----------------------------------
I did not know what competitive matchmaking was when I bought this game, and stuck to arms race, demolition, and casual games in the beginning, which I found to be quite interesting. Arms race and demolition maps were quite distinct game modes in CS:GO, where there was nothing of the sort from what I remember during my CS 1.6 days. However, it was probably only the first 100 hours of my playtime when I gave these any attention, to never touch them again until the new game mode introduced in the HYDRA campaign took me to those maps again. I believe they are a bit underutilized, and newer game modes introduced in HYDRA should be added to CS:GO as well. So then we can have arms race, demolition, stab stab zap, and a few other options for players looking to have fun, casual game play. Kids like playing such game modes, the one with only the scout, the stab-stab-zap one, arms race, etc. These modes are best suited to serve the needs of the younger audience, thus keeping them away from the more serious game modes like MM.

Competitive Matchmaking:
-----------------------------------
MM is what keeps me playing CS:GO. Despite buying more than some 50 other titles that I love. I cant seem to break off from it and give time to any of those other games. The urge to play just ""one more MM game"" is very strong. Winning matches results in elation. Losing is heartbreaking. Like getting dumped. It's emotionally draining. You wanna kill the team mates who cant follow strats, have potato aim, rush when it isn't required, don' know nades, don't have proper game sense, have boosted accounts, aren't taking the game seriously when it is meant to be, playing matchmaking as if its a joke, throwing rounds, talking utter garbage or chatting on the microphone instead of making right calls, or don't have microphones, are just plain dumb noobs, or happen to be kids. 

Matchmaking is great, but not completely without its many flaws. Sometimes, it royally messes up on team balance and the result is where one team just gets steamrolled in the game. Unbalanced teams, players with boosted accounts who don't know the maps they are playing, cheaters, and players who play it casually are some of it's major drawbacks. I won't say they happen every game, but often enough where you want such issues to be addressed by the developer. 

Cheating and scamming:
--------------------------
The bane of CSGO. While cheating exists in many forms in all other popular games being played in multiplayer, it is quite rampant in this one, which is shameful for a number of reasons. First, the is a game developed by Valve, which is owned by steam, so in a manner of saying, this is steam’s own game. A company which has earned billions has failed to curtail cheating effectively for more than the 6 years that this game has been running, which is simply unacceptable. This is a very poor record and one of the biggest reasons that lend credence to theories where people say valve doesn’t care and is in it only for the money. 

The anti-cheats, if there are any, have miserably failed. It’s also a reason why many people have shifted to other games now, and will continue to do so over the coming years. I run into people wall hacking or aim hacking, mostly using both every 3rd or 4th game. As for scammers, how difficult is it to assemble a team of 15-20 individuals to oversee and ban scammers? A team that investigates cases sent to it by users in the form of screenshots, etc., which they can then further establish through data they have access to? Then ban the scammers, and return the items defrauded to their rightful owners? I don’t think it would be that difficult. 


Popular Media:
--------------------
One way of gauging the popularity of a game is to check its presence online on social media, such as Youtube or twitch, etc. CSGO has this in spades, with both the number and quality of streamers, pros, and CSGO youtuber, as well as their fans. 

Some of these famous youtubers were what hooked me to the game and inspired me to continually improve. People such as The Warowl, Hougoungagne, luckyskillfaker, nickbunyun, bananagaming, cruxal, etc. I have learned a lot from them, esp the Warowl. I admire these people and look forward to their videos. Its an aspect of the community that I love, learning and teaching others. Not a lot of games have this kind of support. If I were valve, I’d pay them to make more videos, and take their feedback seriously. After all, these players, even without being a part of valve, are one of the game’s biggest stakeholders. Without their videos and content, I’d probably get a tad bored over the coming months. Worse still, if they shift to playing other games and posting videos for those, I’d probably shift to playing those games too, in the long run maybe. 

And this is what is happening right now. With PUBG the latest gaming fad, the developers not listening to some serious concerns of the audience, etc., CSGO has some serious rebrebuilding to do. The developers should take these people, these youtubers on board somehow, and support them. 

Community Market:
----------------------------
With the birth of micro-transactions and the community market, unknowingly the seeds of corruption were sown into this game, and many others. With it, valve stumbled on a cash cow, a minting machine of sorts. The community market alone probably generates millions of dollars in revenue each week for steam. It has turned the community toxic, made beggars out of people, set a whole new gambling industry, and given rise to huge levels of scamming.

There should not have been cases in the first place. Steam / valve should have just put the skins they liked in the market directly. No demand / supply thing. Set the prices according to the status of skins. Detailed skins of high quality, think Dragon lore for instance, at $10. Safari Mesh at 50 cents. Elite build at $4-5. A percentage of the fee could have gone to the developer of the skin as royalty. It could have helped the developer become better. Pay for college. I don’t know. The rest could have gone to Valve. Everybody could have afforded any skin they wanted. I don’t think there would have been any scamming or gambling then. 


Final Word:
---------------
Will this game fizzle out in the next couple of years?

I don’t think so. There are quite a lot of people who are heavily invested in it through their purchases of skins. That, I believe is one of the biggest contributors to keeping this game alive till now, however much I hate this fact. Second, it still has low hardware requirements compared to its competition, and as a result a lot of people who don’t have the latest hardware can still play it. 

PUBG, which seems to be the game that has taken away a lot of viewership and playing audience from CS, is at best a fad in its current stage. One that is not likely to die down for the time being, but may fade soon enough if it doesn’t evolve. 
CS is an FPS veteran. It has its variety, its history, its balance, and its gameplay. Its losing its audience, but I still believe it has what it takes to bring them back, provided the developers starts giving some fucks.",True

Communities and creative individuals of those communities have invented a wide vareity of very innovative gametypes. Different gametypes, from any other game, like surfing; where each player must slide down large slopes to gather momentum to launch themselves over large gaps in the slopes - if you don't have enough speed; you fall, die and restart.  The speed and intense feeling of gaining that momentum is an entirely amazing concept alone.  There's also Jailbreak; where the Terrorists are in jail cells and the Counter-Terrorists are the jail security guards and one Counter-Terrorist is picked as the warden.  The warden will use their voice to issue commands to the Terrorists in specifically-made maps that contain minigames like a jumping obstacle course, bomb dodging arena, surfing course, and in one map I even saw a skeet-shooting arena where the skeet were the Terrorists hahahaha. If the terrorists are found betraying what the warden says the security team has rights to terminte that inmate which makes for an amazing level of deception as a Terrorist and a sense of mystery and hunting as a jail security guard.  These clever vareity of gametypes are only the tip of the iceberg as there are many servers with mods such as Warcraft; where players gain EXP to purchase skills and upgrades that give abilities such as a grapeling hook, a power jump, or temporary invisibility.  

While all the different gametypes are perfect for casual time spent playing and socializing with the hundreds of thousands of players constantly playing this game; i've yet to mention the competitive side which is by far the stake-in-the-ground of CS's long-lasting playability.  The professional scene, while it IS great, is not my primary description of 'competitive side'; the competitive side is more the general philosophy that, if a player is willing, they can nearly ALWAYS improve upon themselves.  There are fundamentals in this game that once learned you can build upon by yourself, with friends, or with an entire community to create quality and constructive gameplay for thousands of hours.  This philosophy alone is the groundwork for the seemingly endless vareity of topics any player can choose to constructively upon build their skills. 
Here are a few examples of different things in the game that contribute to its learnability:

[b]Game-sense:[/b] The sense you get when you don't see an enemy and you can determine where they are based on where they are not.  Game-sense also runs deep with the strategic and competitive de_, or Demolition, style gametypes which are round-based (meaning when you die you're dead until the end of the round).  In demolition there are 2 bombsites that the Terrorists have to choose from, and the CTs must guard both until they get a feeling of which bomb site the Ts have chosen.  Once they depict which way the Ts are heading the CTs must 'rotate', or re-route their attention, through the map to the other bombsite.  This 'rotation' creates predictable motions from either team and you can learn to expect certain actions and invent creative ways to approach the bomb sites.  This style of gameplay greatly contributes to the total capacity of the game-sense CS instills.

[b]Gun spray control:[/b] Unlike most shooters each gun in CS has a ""pattern"" that a spray of bullets from each gun has.  Most shooters have an algorithim that seemingly randomizes sprays but CS has a LEARNABLE and CONTROLLABLE spray.  There are many other variables such as movement speed, crouched status, and spray speed that factor into it but overall spray patterns are discoverable through experience and experimentation which can greatly contribute to how powerful the weapons can seem at different levels of awareness of these variables.

[b]Map strategy:[/b] CS has a wide vareity of maps.  In some, close-quarter and in-the-moment reaction is needed and in others much more planning and teamwork is required to prevail.  Also some maps, as mentioned, are game-type specific so depending on what you're looking for out of CS you can browse community servers to find it or que up in competitive matchmaking and only play the maps you want.There are also many tricks in each map such as jumps, grenade bounces, houses or buildings you can throw grenades over to position them strategically.  

All of these aspects greatly contribute to the philosophy of self-growth and trying to make yourself a better player regardless of what people you play with, what gametype you play, or if you even decide play competitive matchmaking.  Its all up to you and this game can provide you that great sense of progression and growth that I've not found in a video game in a long, long time.",True

2400,"I think its time to make a personal review of this awesome and sad game...

I LOVE THIS GAME! I really do! Its great, if is not the best fps out there, for sure its in the second place! Why? Because its a game that for SURE NEEDS SKILL!   And if you have skill, you will kill many people in many ways, and maybe mostly, with HS ( headshots). But due to HS, if you kill the same people lots of times with hs, what will happen? You will be called CHEATER! Because its obvious! 

People with lower skill than you, cant compete, but they try and they die. So they rage, they get pissed and report you! Just like happened today. In a deathmatch, in Overgrown map, I was playing with mag-7 for a mission, and in close-mid range, I killed 2 players many times with HS, and of course, got reported for cheating! 

The game is amazing, but some people ruin it!   But at the end of that match, I got rewarded  with a beautiful skin, that is M4A1-S Master Piece.

Skins is another thing that people take alot in consideration. I do to! I love skins like most of the people, and every person have their own tastes, and I dont think players should be judged for having skins that costs 1€ or 100€. If you like them, get them, its easy as this. The only problem is, if you let it, is that people will say: ""Oh man this guy is rich! Look at that knife and that Awp!"" or "" This guy sucks! Look this lame guy! Doesnt even have a skin!""

So yeah, I do recommend this game, for its gameplay, realism in some aspects and if you do some competition with friends, its the best!  Play the best you can, and if you still lose/ fail, pratice alot, because with will everything is possible.",True

This is like that controversy in star wars when they say 'ham shot the man first' because when georgie lucas remade the film with better actors (it's called Lord Of The Rings if you are interested in watching, the special effects are to die for and there is a talking tree which is just genius) ham solo was shot in the face and died, which made lots of people sad because he was a really good actor, especially that bit when he got frozen in the black ice stuff andhad to stand still in an uncomfortable position for a really long time. I once had a job where i was on the register at a shop and had to stand still for a really long time but i entertained myself by committing minor acts of shoplifting. Really it all just comes back to crime and if you want to be the counter terrorism guy and shoot the bad guys in the face this is the game for you. But if you are a renegade soul who just needs to see the world burn like the bad guy in that batman film who died then i would suggest a different game like Peggle.",True

The professionals who has devoted hours upon hours into Counter-Strike, and will not stop until they are proven to be the very best out there. I follow this example. It brings me up again after experiencing things that makes me absolutely HATE the game. Either it be timings, internet lag, fps drops, bad communication from teammates, insane plays by the enemies or, the worst of all. Your inability to play good. We always come back to Counter-Strike.

CS:GO is a great game for casual and serious gamers. If you want to have some fun you can just join a casual match or browse the community servers for nice community made mods, like jailbreak, Hide'n'Seek or Zombie Escape. 

But you can also play serious games by joining competitive games. Those require 2 full teams made of 5 players. They play a full match against each other. Every single match is recorded which means you can report cheaters and other bad gamers. Cheaters get banned pretty fast in this game, sometimes they don't even last 3 hours and they account is banned. 

This game beats other games like Battlefield for CoD when it comes to competitive gameplay. Once you played cs:go you can't go back to them anymore because they feel like kiddy games. 

You can also download a lot of custom maps made by the community, Valve doesn't forces you to buy DLC's like other game publishers.",True

2442,"If you join a pub server and scroll through the players you'll probably find at least one more or less blatant waller, and you can rest assured VAC isn't going to detect their tutorial copy paste cheats any time soon. You know it's bad when there's an actual business around providing a 3rd party matchmaking system where people don't cheat, and there's more than one competing platform.
 
Gun balance is what it is, it comes and goes with Valves seemingly random patches. Some changes the community agrees with, some it doesn't, not like the community can always even agree with itself. Pistols are stronger than I'd like, certainly stronger than in previous titles. Acceleration and player speed are quite quick, which sometimes leads to frustrating experiences with getting dicked on by a strafe spamming pistol player.

Speaking of frustrating experiences, it's hard to blame Valve for the playerbase, but still I wish there was something to be done about it. Mostly matchmaking gives you cool teammates, but sometimes you face a tirade of rage and abuse without any recourse. I'm not sure the reports actually do anything.

You could say there's a lot of customizability what with the cosmetics, skins and sprays and such. It's just that you used to be able to download them from fpsbanana but Valve has figured out a way to turn that into a revenue stream. Good for them, money sink for others. Granted, you don't need cosmetics but I think it's safe to say most like to have a few. I have mixed feelings.

2472,"The sky was a turquoise blue and the weather a perfect 86 degrees as the pair, known to their fans as TmarTn and Syndicate, found a quiet spot to chat. Both had already leveraged their fame to make themselves wealthy. Martin, who has 3.2 million subscribers on YouTube, was dabbling in real estate; Cassell, whose videos are seen by his 10 million followers, had his own clothing line. Fans would line up to meet them at conventions, and their endorsements were enough to make or break new games. Now, as they settled in under the shade of a palm tree, the men plotted their next fortune in esports. They were about to move into a new multibillion-dollar world that had virtually no regulation -- a burgeoning Wild West of gambling centered on a game they'd spent countless hours playing online, Counter-Strike: Global Offensive.

The first-person-shooter game pits terrorists against counterterrorists and was played by an average of 342,000 people at once in 2016. Its biggest tournaments, such as the ELeague Major scheduled for Jan. 22-29 in Atlanta, can have million-dollar prize pools and as many as 27 million streaming viewers. An estimated 26 million copies of the $15 game have been downloaded since its debut four years ago, helping make its manufacturer, Valve, the world's leading distributor of PC titles.

While other titles such as Call of Duty offer similar gameplay, one distinctive feature has helped fuel Counter-Strike's growth: collectible items in the game called ""skins."" Although they don't improve anyone's chances of winning, the skins cover weapons in distinctive patterns that make players more identifiable when they stream on services like Twitch. Users can buy, sell and trade the skins, and those used by pros become hotly demanded. Some can fetch thousands of dollars in online marketplaces.

Valve controls the skins market. Every few months, it releases an update to Counter-Strike with new designs. It decides how many of each skin get produced and pockets a 15 percent fee every time one gets bought or sold on its official marketplace, called Steam. Valve even offers stock tickers that monitor the skins' constantly shifting values.

But Valve also leaves a door open into the programming of its virtual world, one that allows skins to move out of Steam and into a murky constellation of gambling websites, where they're used as currency. Some $5 billion was wagered in skins in 2016, according to research by the firms Eilers & Krejcik Gaming and Narus Advisors. While about 40 percent of them are bet on esports matches and tournaments, says Chris Grove, who authored a study for the companies, roughly $3 billion worth flows to a darker corner of the internet -- one populated by fly-by-night websites that accept skins for casino-style gaming. Here, the games are simple, the action is fast and new sites open as soon as others close. Plenty of adults visit these sites, but with virtually no age restrictions, kids are also able to gamble their skins -- often bought with a parent's credit card -- on slots, dice, coin flips or roulette spins. At least one site even has pro sports betting.

None of this could happen without Valve, a privately held company run by its charismatic co-founder, Gabe Newell. The billionaire, who according to Forbes owns more than 50 percent of the company, has watched his personal wealth rocket to $4.1 billion, due in part to Counter-Strike's success.

As they sipped cocktails in the Hollywood Hills that day in 2015, Martin and Cassell decided that as long as the casino was open, they would get their cut.",True
2473,shit game,True
2474,"Counter Strike Global Offensive is a concrete follow up to CS Source. With constant updates and smooth gameplay it is near the perfect online shooter. But lets start with the bad points, first of all the game is riddled with hacks which can ruin a ranked game as you are either forced to leave and accept a penalty or carry on playing through the practically unbeatable round. This is probably the worst aspect of the game

This said CSGO is one of the few games that has made E-sports what it is today, it is a fair game that you can just pick up and play (if you don't count hackers). And always leave you wanting just one more game.


Conclusion - Not a game for everyone and can be frustrating at times however is definitely one of the defining FPS games out there and if you enjoy it the first time you play it, it will keep bringing you back for hours of fun.

2496,"This game comes with a lot of flaws as well as bonuses.

First off: This game requires a lot of dedication if you ever plan on becoming pro, a youtubers, or at least achieve something worth noting in the community.

Pros:
+ Replayability. Though this might not apply as much as it used to before pubg existed, you would constantly have that nudging feeling to keep coming back to this game no matter how many times you raged or broke your keyboard because of some stupid fucking reason that was obviously caused by the enemy’s hacks — it’ll somehow always bring you back. It’s fun no matter how many times you may beat down on it, but unless you have a good reason or you just burnt yourself too quickly, you’ll be able to always come back to this game with a big smile to your face.
+ Party Capability and Customization. Of course like most of the other games on Steam, there’s a workshop page that lets people create maps, skins, etc. for fun. Whether it be a coop map, or a fighting game like that one tekken-chicken parody we had around for a while on the front page, CS:GO without a doubt can be a source of great fun and entertainment. Aside from workshop-made maps however, there’s also matchmaking where sometimes you’ll be able to encounter a fun server with people willing to do nonsensical bs once in a while. Like once, a couple of friends and I managed to get an entire server onto a friend’s discord server and do stratroulette. T’was fun. 
+ Updates. With updates coming around every so often, Valve’s willing to put in their time (sometimes) in order to change up a few things to make the game less broken as it used to back in 2012. Whether you love them or hate them, Valve still updates the game after so many years of the game’s launch and this can open for a LOT of interesting things. Though there was a time when Valve was idiotic enough to add the R8 which was a one shot kill upon release but now ended up becoming a set aside meme gun only to be used in particular circumstances to troll or be one of the few to ever try to learn how to use it.

Cons:
- Dedication. With a matchmaking system, a pro-scene and many other things behind it, csgo can be rather time consuming and can require a lot of dedication when you first pick it up. While at first it might not look great at first for the beginners and the casual players, putting in time and effort just to practice and learn how to use the weapons, economy, gamesense, etc. Granted, depending on your situation like whether you’re in school or have work, you’ll need to figure out how to fit csgo into one of your timeslots if you ever plan to become better at it.
- Balancing Issues. Though balancing is getting better as time progresses and more updates are put out, you can’t deny the fact that balancing takes a long time for Valve to figure out, and this comes with a lot in mind. With things like the op pistols of the past, we can’t completely rely on Valve to simply fix balancing on the fly especially when even other, smaller things like operations take almost a year just to release and the fix for the tec-9 and the five seven taking years just to fix.

Neutral:
+ Community. Like said in Party Capability and Customization, you can encounter some pretty interesting players that can lead to some other, interesting things to occur. Whether it be being able to fool around as an entire server, or simply have non-toxic, Elmer’s Glue-esque teammates, the community can be pretty interesting in their own way. And just like matchmaking, there’s also the people on the /r/globaloffensive and co. subreddits that can be pretty supportive. Like the time when rob, a csgo player fighting cancer reached out on the /r/globaloffensive subreddit, telling us how much he liked the community, he was able to garner comments on both his post and his profile that show support.
- Community/Trust Factor. That being said, there are still people that make the entire game sour for everyone else. Be it the griefers, cheaters, smurfs, and simply the very toxic, sodium-based individuals, they all know how to make a game worse for everyone around them. This can be a problem in both the low ranks and high ranks as handling smurfs when you just started playing is quite difficult in itself. While there is a trust factor system in place now that could prevent some smurfs from making it through and ruining legitimate, low-ranked matchmaking games, this same trust factor system can be the bane of new players to come. 

Note: This is what I have in mind currently and does not reflect the entire community’s point of view, but is broad enough to make clear any pros and cons the game has. There can be some things I’m missing, but could have left them out as again, I am being very broad when it comes to this review. Though all in all, I can give the game a 7/10 if I would rate this on a numerical format.",True

however if you are planning on getting it, its better to have a group of friends that you can play with as the solo queue system isnt the best if you want to rank up . also its much more fun that awy :D
skins are a huge part of csgo but they arent necessary so dont worry about not having any.
the gameplay has a huge learning curve but once you overcome it , the game becomes so much more rewarding.
although its a fun game , there are many people who are toxic and or smurfs which can throw the fun off. but if you persist you can still rise in ranks",True

I still play the games with my group of friends, spending time together. Discussing about the strategies and events about the game is still fun. Competitive still great, but the casual mode is a little dead now.

-You can waste all time in Cs:go
-VAC systemis working perfect . there are very low hackers in comp.
-You got overwatch system . You can watch a reported player and decide that hack or not. 
-Skins are very beutiful and adds more fun and swank to game .
-You can communicate with other players vie microphone in competitive.
-Developers always trying to improve game .
-There are lots of third party jackpot-Betting and gambling sites . You can win lots of skins and money.

- Negative 
-Competitive matchmaking system. (smurfs and pro players are goes to enemy team.)
-RUSSIANS
-Usual Cs mechanics. Spray Ak to ground and get hs.
-Some bomb bugs
-You can get rage and mad very faster.
- I miss the old ranking system. Right now This ranking system is bullshit.


I recommend cs:go to all cs lovers and players. 

Cs:Go is not for Russians , kids and peoplr who never have played cs in their life. 

Recomended",True
2532,"Valve, I salute you. This is an incredible game based off incredible games, with it's updated graphics, the game looks alot better. Old school gameplay but with huge mod support. Players can make any map and put it into the game. Players can make skins and put these into the game, Valve may even pay you to do this.

Aside from the standard gameplay (mostly bomb defuse), which is actually quite realistic considering the intensive recoil on every gun, the game brings a huge economy on just simply skins through buying keys on dropped crates throughout the maps inside the game.
CS GO has been growing enormously and it will continue to grow, especially because of E-sports, the betting on teams, the 'skins' economy and a huge growing community. 
Valve also updates the game regularly. ('cough' Tec-9 nerf 'cough')

Greatly recommended to anyone wanting to play a serious shooter with a rather steep learning curve.


Although like every other competitive game, new players are going to  have a rather hard time.
Ranked games has A LOT of smurfs, especially on lower ranks, which hurts many of the new players.
Also even with Valve trying to VACban every hacker, there still seems to be quite a few in the game, especially at higher ranks (Above Distuingished Master Guardian)

If you like shooters, buy it, play it, love it. Just don't jump into ranked until you've gotten down the heavy recoil, some basic map knowledge and anger management. Especially the last one, trust me on that.


Plusses:
+ If you've always wanted to learn Russian, now is your chance.
+ Recoil system
+ Lots of maps
+ Mod support
+ Custom servers
+ Huge in E-sports
+ CS:GO has its own economy with skins
+ Did I say skins already ?
+ Overwatch system
+ Decent amount of weaponry
+ Gambling (both sides)
+ Dedicated servers
+ Huge amount of services throughout other sites with their own servers (ESEA, FACEit etc.)
+ Surfing

Minusses:
- Russians
- Hackers
- Smurfcity
- Toxic players (If u are new and bad, do NOT play ranked yet)
- Gambling (both sides)
- Gameplay can get repetitive

The plusses outweight the minusses, get the game ! The pricing isn't high at all, so definitely give it a try.",True

esse game é bala",True
2537,"Before playing CS:GO - "" Who tf would pay $300 for a virtual knife ""
After playing CS:GO - "" I'm gonna spend my Christmas money on a knife! ""

On a more serious note, I really liked the game and have invested many hours into it ( 38 hrs in the past 2 weeks and I can only play on weekends, including Fridays, so basically I've spent about a third of my weekend, if the math adds up, this past 2 weeks on CS:GO ). I find it really fun to play, I'd just say if its you're very first time palying CS:GO on PC, don't head straight into competitive. I played CS:GO on the XBOX since it was released and was decent at it so I thought it would also apply to PC, but I wasn't accustomed to the mouse and keyboard, and lost a bunch of games in competitive and after my 10 wins I got placed in silver. However, I am getting the hang of it now, and am pretty much top-fragging everygame, just got promoted recently, and pretty much I'm aiming to climb to nova during winter break. Past experiences with this series. As said before I've played it CS:GO on the XBOX. I've also played the original CS and CS:CZ, but I've never touched source before. I'd make a comparison but I was really young when I played this so it wouldn't be very accurate. Community-wise, I haven't ran into many toxic players. Most people are willing to communicate and are pretty nice. This game does have its share of ""12 year olds"" and people who like to constantly talk to the fact that you can't concentrate, but that is very small, I rarely meet any of these ""bad"" people. I'd also say that from my point of view, the game is pretty balanced between the 2 sides, I mean sure the T AK is 1 hit headshot ( oh yeah aim for headshots, ight be hard at first but you'll quickly get the hang of it ) while, the CT M4 is 2, you've got to remember that CT's are usually the ones defending, you actually have to get that headshot, you can always pick up an AK from a dead T and you switch sides at 15 rounds, and unless you're 0:15 it should even out. 

tl;dr
My overall rating of the game 10/10, really enjoyed palying it and will continue to do so

2559,"CS:GO may seem too familiar to those who have played Source. Source felt a bit wishy-washy, with no official modes and servers. CS:GO is not only well-organised but more catering to less experienced players whilst still retaining the essence of what makes counter-strike a proffessional gamer's shooter. New weapons may seem more like reskins but I prefer the simplicity of having no silencers and the properly working stats and decent achievements right from the game's release as oppose to an update 5 years after the game's release or something. Global Offensive's graphics aren't vastly different, but it is certainly the best looking shooter on the Source engine to date, and doesn't look as outdated as it should do for a 2004 game engine. The game seems well balanced, snipers are impressive, the Scout/SSG is no longer terrible and genuinely viable in competitive matches. Blur is added to sniper scopes while moving to balance them too. WWeapons do seem balanced and people use more than just AK, MR, Deagle and AWP. The 4 game modes - Casual Competitive, Classic Competitive, Demolition and Arms Race means there's something for everyone. Sure there's no Capture the Flag but in a game where there's no sprinting, health regen, killstreaks, aim down sights or ability to revive or heal teammates, it's probably for the best. Gun game is finally officially supported, and Demolition simplifies the game by removing the need to buy weapons. I've always wanted to try counter-strike properly but Source was just far too disorganised and had other distractions. Global Offensive brings the classic game into a modern setting without falling into the trap of being a Call of Duty clone. It's still counter-strike, with exactly the same gameplay mechanics as the original, but presented in a more appealing and fun package. It certainly feels more welcoming for newcomers than Source, which is a big plus not only for competitive gaming but for the franchise as a whole. The only thing lacking is Team Deathmatch, however this would require a ""Create a Class"" which would turn it into CoD. Arms Race fills that spot, and Demolition combines Classic CS with Gun Game. The primary reason why this game is more accomodating is because it was meant to be a port of Source to Xbox LIVE, so obviously some things needed to be changed or added to broaden its appeal. And for the most part, Valve have done a great job. Matchmaking is efficient, bots for offline play are exclellent with decent AI programming rather than the predictably linear Source AI and the package as whole is much more modern as oppose to Source, where it was a case of ""too little, too late"" when they decided to update it. If you haven't played CS before and want to give it a go, this is the best game. Equally if you are a seasoned Veteran it might make for a refereshing start if you are looking to get back into it.",True

A skin, a weapon case, you never know ! 
   The best way to play, is to play competitively. The game has a Matchmaking system, that finds you a nearby server to play on, with 9 other players to fill your 5v5 match. This is where you have to play good, where you have to win.
   After your first few matches, you will be given a Skill Group. That, is your rank. It's based on your  K / D ratio, and the amount of wins and consecutive wins you've had in previous matches. The Matchmaking system's job is to match you with players of your level. If you don't wanna play serious, though, you can still hop in the thousands of servers with random stuff! Deathrun, Zombie Survival, Deathmatch, you name it! It's still tons of fun. But the real deal is in Competitive.

[i]Game:[/i] Counter-Strike: Global Offensive
[i]Genre:[/i] Multiplayer FPS
[i]Developer:[/i] Valve
[i]Publisher:[/i] Valve
[i][u]Copy supplied by Steam[/u][/i]

[b]Counter-Strike: Global Offensive[/b] is a multiplayer first-person shooter developed and published by Valve.

Since there are many, many reviews of this game, I am gonna keep this short and simple. Graphically, the Source Engine holds up very well, and performance is always around 100fps when playing with High settings.

The gameplay is the same as the previous installments of the franchise: you buy weapons at the beginning of the round, and the main objective is: as Counter-Terrorists to save hostages in Hostage Rescue, as Terrorists to plant a bomb. The shooting requires skills, but also a lot of luck, since the spray'n'pray strategy that many new players adopt rarely works out well.

The game is incredibly fun and satisfying to play. The only real issue are some members of the community: if you are the last player alive and you can't defuse the bomb in time or you get killed, there is a high chance that one of your teammates will call you a noob and will kick you from the server (especially when playing Competitive). This can increase the frustration quite a lot, but there are also many good players who are kinder and much more forgiving when faced with nearly impossible situations to get out alive from.

Overall, this has quickly become one of my favorite multiplayer shooters out there, thanks to rewarding gameplay, high challenge and varied game modes (there are also Deathmatch, Arms Race, Demolition). And yeah, getting a few cents by selling cheap weapon skins on the market doesn't suck. Gambling does. Highly recommended game to everyone!

2598,"What I like:
In CS:GO (Counter Strike: Global Offensive) I love how there are camos/skins on weapons because no other game is like it. I also love how they're are a workshop where you can create skins, maps, stickers, ect. CS:GO also has a lot of people playing it so if you are playing on a random server, you are guaranteed to have other players on there. The fact there are servers ""you"" can make.

What I dislike:
The fact there are smurfs that play with silvers and just make there games horrible. I mean this is not me since I'm not in Silver I'm Master Guardian, but that has nothing to do with this review. Anyways I dislike how they removed Operation Vanguard from the maps because I loved Season and Workout a lot. I know you can still get the maps off the workshop and still play it, but it's just not the same. I think valva should add more things to do in the tutorial so begineers understand more about the game.

2623,"We're talking about the absolute TITAN in classic competitive first person shooters. 
The FATHER of addictive multiplayer combat set in a contemporary universe. Before Call of Duty. Before Battlefield. Before anything else that hefts up an AK-47 and and pulls back the charging handle... This did it first. And in many ways, it still does it best.


I've met incredible people here. Some of the best friends of my life are actually from this. 
I've had incredible moments in this game. I've had laughter, moments of triumph, situations to overcome, comradery that I cannot even begin to describe, and a feeling of satisfaction that nothing else for $14.99 can come close to. (Short of a roadside BJ from your locals finest.) 

Nothing compares to the sharp, precise aim, the satisfying and punchy weapon bob... The sexy, sharpened and modernized gun models, crisp anti-aliased graphics running on a mature and tight version of Source... And the fact that this entirely new looking package is wrapped around the SAME hardcore game that 1.6 popularized way-back when, albeit with a few tweaks between all of the versions, means that it has a whole other layer that Battlefield, and Call of Duty can NEVER touch. ""What is that 'layer' you speak of"" you say? Many things, and the fact that I can SEE this clearly without ever stepping into the beating heart of CS:GO - competetive [At the time of this posting finally with no text limit, I have finally played 5 rounds of comp. 3 wins! It is a whole other amazing side to the game] is an achievement regarding the message this game wants to send its playerbase.  - 

It's all about the community. It's all about a skill that needs to be HONED, not unlocked. It's about playing for HOURS and perfecting that single shot down that hallway. It's a game that stands perfectly on its own as a shooter, but manages to weave the MLG aspect into it seamlessly, without, in MY opinion... Dividing its playerbase. It's all there, all the time. A feeling of professionalism can wash over ANYONE in this game at least ONCE in their time with it. I can NOT say that about Source, or 1.6. Those were daunting, trudging beasts... Leviathans that I feel newcomers could not make headway in if they just wanted to have some fun and see what all the fuss is about. With the slight exception of Source. My time with that title was a mixed bag. Its graphics felt disjointed, and decidedly a mod, which is perfectly acceptable (duh)... But its shooting seemed almost RANDOM... And many 1.6 purists will say similar regarding not being able to enjoy the ballistics. 

The fact is that Counter Strike is often all about the MLG nowadays. And yet this entry in the franchise can stand on its own as a FUN game to just mess around in without feeling the pressure.... It is something to truly behold for ANY PC gamer. Being able to enjoy the hardcore without BEING hardcore is a treat. As you get better, the progression of your skill as a gamer feels tangible. You do NOT need unlocks, and idiotic modifiers to your gear to feel like you are getting anywhere. NOTHING gets in the way of your skill. No unlocks, no killstreaks, no aiming down sights... It's just you, your gun, your knife, and your ability to FUCK UP the opposition. NOTHING else. It is such a worthy game that within a year of its release I'd been able to put over 350 hours into it, and I feel like more time could have been spent within its corridors, its rooftops, backrooms,  and its long, stressful hallways. 

The feeling of PERSONAL progression and satisfaction I felt made me say left and right that I wished they'd add some kind of personalization, and a smart system that makes you MORE addicted. Not hats, just some way to make you give back to yourself in a meaningful way. A customization and unlock system for vanity gear would be fantastic, a new horizon for the game. It makes the game feel timeless, and without need of many other entries for some time, just updates for polish. And? Valve always listens. It's not PERFECT, but the skins add a new breath of air to the game. Even if you're not good, you're still the snob with that purple tier weapon, and everyone hates you. And they should. It's ok to hate on it just as much as it's ok to use these new pieces of bling.
Everyone is doing it.

And to speak of content? Valve games main strength has always been community based  content that keeps your game living and breathing. Never slipping into the pile of ""used up."" There's always more to play with.... And now with the integrated workshop, and official server support  for TOP map creations...(if you donate to both Valve and the makers, a hugely smart way for Valve to make money in a less greedy way than map packs). You can be assured that CS:GO has a lot more than just the addicting gameplay, community, the entertaining MLG scene, and most importantly self growth to keep you coming back thanks to these additions.

The Arms Deal Update has its hand on your wallet, but through means of community driven sales, not just ones from the company... And NONE of it EVER affects your skill... Unless that purple SSG 552 fills you with divine rage that you just can't help but get headshot fever.  you can make some decent  digital goods money, and so can everyone else. I so no issue regarding this update, and thankfully after some weeks of growing pains, it seems everyone is on the same page.

Intense firefights. Room for skill growth. The ABILITY (good luck) to have incredible social interactions.. Hilarious conversations. Things that I'll never forget. Especially thanks to the people I'd managed to call my best friends from this. Those are all the luck of the draw. But when you buy this game, one thing is for sure- You're buying a piece of gaming history with the freshest breath of fresh air I've ever seen. 

And it is a triumph.",True

2648,"Death is a great teacher. Failure in Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is, as it always has been for this series, the greatest way to learn where you should have gone, what you shouldn't have done, and how you could have done better. Counter-Strike players spend a lot of time learning -- consequently, they are always getting better.

Growth is an important factor in Global Offensive, especially if you're coming into Counter-Strike fresh or after a sabbatical. This is an extremely hardcore, skill-based first-person shooter, and it forces you to think differently than other modern shooters. If you’re a Call of Duty player, you’re going to need to change your play style to succeed here. Counter-Strike also tries developing into something new here as well, despite doing little to push itself beyond what it’s always done best. Global Offensive modifies old maps to keep veterans on their toes, and introduces official new modes that encourage different play styles for the first time in almost 15 years.

For the uninitiated, Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is a small-scale, team-based first-person shooter with permanent death. When a counter-terrorist kills a terrorist planting explosives in a classic Defusal match, or a CT escort swallows a sniper round in Hostage Rescue, the victim is dead for good and doesn't respawn until the next round. As such, players on both sides must exercise skill and care. The bomb objective, meanwhile, gives everyone a purpose. Of course matches end when everyone on a team is dead, but a clever and coordinated terrorist team will give the CTs the slip, plant their bomb, and protect the bomb site. Between rounds, everyone spends earned cash on better gear and guns, and the cycle continues.

Pieces of the Counter-Strike formula are dated at this point, but the superb heart and soul of Global Offensive is timeless. Teams are small, guns are lethal, and rounds are short. There's an addictive just-one-more-round quality to it, because there's a constant desire to do better than last time, to earn a satisfying kill, or to win in a new way. Call of Duty and Battlefield vets will wonder why they can't sprint to escape enemy fire or look down the iron sights to improve aim; Counter-Strike players will feel like they walked into their redecorated home. Certain map redesigns will catch hardcore fans off guard, but the changes are for the best -- the underpass choke point in de_dust, for instance, has a new escape route.

Even in the face of genre evolution, Global Offensive doesn’t care to adapt. CSGO is so dedicated to Counter-Strike's aging ideals despite market and trend changes that it brute-forces its way to success. Part of what makes it such an engaging competitive game is that killing in Global Offensive requires a wholly different skill set than other shooters. Everyone is limited to what they have and can see, with little room for character modification or on-the-fly advantages. Running and gunning is a useless play style, even if you've bought a helmet and kevlar that round, to the point that someone standing still is more likely to score the kill. Walking, crouching, or standing are your best bets to reduce the inaccurate spray of machine-gun fire.

Consequently, killing in Global Offensive feels good. There's a sickening sensation to dropping someone dead because you know they're not coming back. It's also satisfying knowing you used limited resources to play smarter than your victim. If players aren't watching corners, providing covering fire, or using smoke grenades and flashbangs, they're more likely to take a headshot from a more delicate and patient triggerman. The desire to experience that distinct feeling is a strong motivator to keep playing, even when you're getting steamrolled by an obviously better team.

If you've played Counter-Strike before, Global Offensive probably sounds a whole lot like Counter-Strike. Like Counter-Strike: Source before it, Global Offensive exists simply to modernize the look of the classic competitive shooter, while doing little to disrupt the core form and function. At the same time, it does enough to color outside the lines of tradition to justify your time and effort.

Fire is one of the most interesting new combat variables. Molotov cocktails and incendiary grenades either roast groups of guys or force them in another direction. Flames are a useful distraction or scare tactic, too. They're particularly useful during Demolition matches, which focus the fight at a single bomb site rather than giving terrorists two to pick between. The new and modified maps in this mode aren't as big as classic Counter-Strike arenas – entire sections have been cut off to direct teams toward a central location – but their thoughtful design is as intricate as ever. The Lake map is a standout -- there's a wide open yet densely populated yard around the bomb site, which is inside a sizable lakeside home with plenty of vantage points and hiding spots. To separate Demolition from Defusal, players can't buy between rounds. Instead, it takes a cue from the other new mode, Arms Race, in which each kill unlocks another weapon instantly. The better you do, the more you have to switch up the way you play, and because Demolition is so fast you'll need to be quick on your feet.

Unlike other game types, Arms Race allows for respawns. It's the most chaotic and care-free mode in Global Offensive, with players throwing caution to the wind for the sake of climbing the kill ladder as quickly as possible. It's a shame there are only two maps in Arms Race -- a problem that will more likely persist on consoles than PC.

If you have the option, playing the PC version is unquestionably the best way to experience Counter-Strike: Global Offensive. Mods, mouse and keyboard, and the usual PC-only options are better than the ports. Plus, Valve is much better about long-term PC support -- it abandoned Team Fortress 2 on consoles, and Portal 2's level editor was PC exclusive. If you prefer to play on consoles, Global Offensive is the same great game, with the following special bits:",True

So as the highest rank the things I have to say is this is definitely a pew pew game. Nothing much other than that. If your good at pew pew games and being tactical then I recommend. If not I rate you invest in some camo first then get into the pew pew.

2664,"Let's start off by saying that this game is the best one in the CS series.

I'd say that CS:GO is a remade version of 1.6, which suits the needs of the current generation - better graphics, stuff is fancy, yet all the competitive elements are still in place.

What's new compared to CS 1.6 and CS:S? There's a new ""mode"" called competitive. People take this rather seriously. You can play it to get higher in rank - in case you've got what it takes to get there, which means you'll get better opponents when you advance. Remember that you have to be on the same (or higher) level as your opponents to get higher. 
You can also play it to realize you belong to the bottom floor. But being on the bottom floor is okay, right? You can only get better. [i]Note: Remember this is a team game. Try to cooperate with your team the best you can. This includes knowing at least some basic smokes and flashes for the maps you're queuing for and communicating with your teammates.[/i]

CS:GO also has the classic server browser you might know from 1.6 and CS:S, wherein you can browse different custom servers (like kz, surf, aim maps, deathmatch etc.), search them by tags/maps/player count/ping, the usual stuff. Some of these servers feature funmodes, which you can play when you feel like playing CS:GO but you don't feel like tryharding. Most of these servers are noob-friendly.

This game is updated constantly, which means tweaks to guns if some are deemed 'overpowered' or 'underpowered', new skins, new operations, new maps, and more. Be sure to have your credit card ready when these things happen, though!",True

2675,"Valve Killed the competitive scen in Counter-Strike 1.6 and  Counter-Strike: Source to get the pro player to move to Counter-Strike: Global Offensive which makes somewhat sense, on a business level.

The Issue is just that the 2 predeseccors, were/are miles better than Counter-Strike: Global Offensive will ever be.
Skins and whatnot has created an economy around Counter-Strike so now Counter-Strike is no longer just an fps game it is much more and apploud Valves success on that, however we had these things in Counter-Strike 1.6 and Counter-Strike: Source aswell (modders and skin makers uploading to third party sites that users could use and we had third party services with matchmaking).

The new players probably when looking back at the predecessors (Counter-Strike and Counter-Strike: Source) may think Valve reinvented the entire game but in fact they have not, all they did was, gather all these things (modders/map makers/ skin makkers and matchmaking service) mash it up together super poorly which is sad, becaus the ""final"" product valve ended up with in Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is in my opinion an abomination to the series of Counter-Strike.

I am probably one of the few players (by few I do not mean 10 or 50 I know we had a lot of player back then aswell but they are old so they probably do not play anymore which is what I mean by few) that has an history that goes back all the way to Counter-Strikes origin back in 1999 I believe, i was around 12 years old when I was first introduced to Counter-Strike and I remember that experience vividly as one of the best moment i had of playing a video games.

I will admit that Valve has done a super nice job when it comes to updating the visual aspect of the game, from Counter-Strike to Counter-Strike: Source it is obvious that the game looked much better and to Counter-Strike: Global Offensive the visuals became even better, that said however I believe the game was ruined in terms of gameplay and performance everything seems so much easier.

I was really good player in Counter-Strike and in Counter-Strike: Source I became alot better not because I was better or maybe I was improving a bit but the everything seemed easier i was hitting shots I would not hit normally in Counter-Strike but in Counter-Strike: Source I would just hit those shots.. and in Counter-Strike: Global Offensive I was hitting shots and i was ranked Global elite, to me that makes no sense because again it seemed easier than Counter-Strike: Source but I was getting much older so the younger generation should obviously react much faster.. and whatnot because the older you get the harder it gets to keep up.. yes there are some exception of great pro players that are old but you see the majority being young players in their early 20 where i am almost 30 .. 

I do enjoy playing Counter-Strike and I will always play it, regardles of it being Counter-Strike, Counter-Strike: source or Counter-Strike: Global Offensive.. because it is in my opinion one the greatest FPS games ever.

Will I recommend this game ? Yes, but only because the game is playable and it does play well and you can have fun, do I believe it is better than its predecessors (Counter-Strike and Counter-Strike: Source)? NO!.",True

2681,"Conter-Strike is an old, but great game, with a huge ""BUT"" after all. 
Let start with ""PRO's"":

- You can play it for free, with some limitations, but you can have your fun with it.
- Great community
- You can meet great people and also become friends
- Different official mods to play (casual, deathmatch, wargames, competetive, a.s.o.)
- a huge amount of different community server with a huge amount of different Mods (DM, aim maps, prison, survive, surfing, hide ans seek, a.s.o.)
- has huge potential for upgrades by community and valve

Neutal: 
- Its a part of the game and for some one outside there its a major ""pro"" point, but not for me, the skins, sticker and models. You can purchase all that for real money on the market, or try your luck by opening cases. tbh the odds are not great to pull out something great from the cases.

Con's:
- The game exist since several years, but has still a lot of bugs in it. So don't be scared, when you stuck somewhere in texture or you don't hit an enemy, cause their is an invisible texture infront of you.
- Lot's of toxic people. You have the possibility to mute them, or to report them for beiing toxic, but this kind of people find other ways to ruin you game (like: teamattack, blocking, using utility, try to vote you out from the game, a.s.o.). It's a shame for an eSport title where the only way to handle with this sort of people is just mute or kick them (when rest of the team is willing to). And after all they stay in the game and can ruin the day of all other people, who playing this game.
- A huge downside of this game are also cheater. They are planty of them in CS GO universum. They are spinning, bunny hopping, can see throug wall or hit allways with their shots in your head. Their are also other types of cheats. But valve also don't care about this problem and thats why their is no active solution for this major problem. Some of them get caught and banned from the game. But this matter not much, cause they creat a new account and play further with their cheats. That is also the main reason, why I personaly don't play competitive any more.
- Also my ""favorit"" the ""join-loop"". Just imagine: You play a non compatitive game and they are cheater or toxic people in the lobby, or you just don't like the map. You start a vote and other people just ignore it. So you leave the lobby and start a surch for a new one. You connect to a lobby and.... it's the same lobby again. So you leave again and search for a new one. You get connected and... its the same lobby. I had a loop, where I got connected 5 times in the row to the same lobby. Their are planty other lobbys, so why Valve? Sorry Valve, but this is bs.
- Also my favorit type of people ""the case-hunter"". Every time, when new cases come out, you will see the ""case-hunter"". They join a DM or Wargame lobby and stand still or run in circles in the hope, that after a round ends, they get as drop a new case. They are the whole time afk. And their are a lot of them. If you unlucky, so you can get an lobby full of them. Then you can't kick them, cause you cant get enough votes. So you leave the lobby. Search for a new one.If you are unlucky you get the ""join-loop"" and after several minutes, you get finaly connected to a other lobby, which is full of this ""case-hunter"". 

Please Valve fix it. Stop just milking this cow and find/make a solution for all this stupid problems.

2697,"Warning, highly addictive! 

Great game to play with your friends and if you don't have any you can find some while playing! It requires both skill and good tactics to win the match and as a team game CS:GO is one of the best ever created. Most people tend to think that it's all about shooting enemies but it's more than that. The aiming itself is difficult and you will have to control the recoil by moving the mouse in the opposite direction as the gun is going so learning to aim well is crucial to be successful in the game. But you will also have to learn grenade spots, and be able to read your opponents mind and know where they will be and what they will do next.

Once you get to know the basics, go ahead and create your own team and compete in online ladders and tournaments or if it feels too difficult, serious or anything just play matchmaking and have fun killing your opponents.

Learning to play at a decent level will take lots of practice and I'm talking about hundreds to thousands of hours. But in CS:GO you don't have to get destroyed by the better players because of its matchmaking system, which is great for new players. It places you in a match with players of the same skill as you, even if you had just bought the game (yeah you will still have to play a few placement matches against [probably] better players before so have fun with that). And to enjoy the game you don't even have to take it so seriously as community servers offer plenty of fun gamemodes such as kz, surfing, bhop etc. that are really fun to spend your time on.

So with that price tag you shouldn't be reading this review anymore and just buy this game. Trust me, it's worth it.",True

Combine AWP's and Desert Eagles; gradually add to the HL3 engine; beat at low speed until you have the basis of CS.

2708,"I have re-written my review and I have written it properly this time. This review is aimed towards people who own the prime version of this game. (If you are a non-prime users skip the paragraph 1 and 2).

I have spent over 800+ hours (including my alternative accounts) in this game. As much I hate this game at the same time it's probably the best game compared to other games I have seen or played out there before. I have started CS:GO on 2017 and I have seen so much scenes in this game so I thought maybe it's time to write a review.

CS:GO is one of the biggest FPS games out there, even if you have no yet played this game you probably might have heard of it. Starting from CS, CS 1.6, CS:S and now CS:GO. So many history has been written in this game. They also have the one of the biggest pro scenes in the world. Watching the pro games and the frags they create lead me to playing this game. The best part about this game is being able to play challenging games with your friends. I mostly play CS:GO not alone but with friends or people I hang out with. I have started from ""Silver Elite Master"" and I have progressed all the way to ""Legendary Eagle"", slowly and piece by piece. I am not a good player myself but I'd also like to call myself a good team player. You always start from a very low position but progress yourself and aim for the top. And that's probably a way you could make yourself proud. So for people who has ""Prime"" or if you do not, I highly recommend you getting prime by ""paying $15"" or progress yourself to level 21 in-game to earn it for free. Although it requires you a lot of patience.

This part is for non-prime users. As you've heard, CS:GO has gone F2P last year (2018). As you could try out CS for free, you need to let yourself know, that this game is FREE. Being free, there will be a lot of cheaters, toxic users and trolls. So like I said, it's better to have prime rather than trying to play this game free. If you plan on continue playing this game for free, I do not recommend you sticking to this game. It requires you extra patience for this.

Anyways pros and cons.

Pros :
- Teamwork and competitive scenes
- Highly recommended multiplayer game for your friends to play together.
- Workshop maps. You are able to play maps other users have created.
- Workshop skins. For people who is into art and designing.
- Very challenging. Must memorize positions, angles, smoke spots, etc.
- Able to create fun content like youtube videos.
- Very addictive.
- Countless updates and bug fixes. (There has been major bug issues though).

Cons :
- Toxic community.
- Toxic players. (Common to run into them)
- Trust Factor. (Personally I have a good trust factor but for people who does not have good trust factor, yikes).
- Having one of the biggest amount of users on Steam, also has one of the biggest amount of cheaters.
- Very stressful for some people. (Please don't stress yourself too much).
- The amount of hates you can receive.
- Crazy amount of smurfs.
- Obsession with virtual skins.
- Not being able to communicate properly.
- Scams.

Ts are winning 3-2.  We are all good sports, except for one dude.  Xban@TIC64, with 2 kills and 3 assists.  He gets frustrated.  Yells in teamchat.  Then the unthinkable happens.  He pulls out a Negev.  And holds down the trigger.

2758,"As a veteran player having played since beta 5.4 (that's the original beta in 2000), I have to say they've done a great job at updating this game and still giving it the classic Counter Strike feel.  The Competitive Matchmaking is well done and generally keeps teams balanced, even with a wide array of ranks on each team.  The new modes are great and definitely show that the devs are listening to their community.  If you like fast action, round based strategic scenario game play, then you should give CS:GO a shot.",True
2759,"Counter Strike is a game that has a very good idea, sadly though the game was completely ruined by the developer team (Valve) with their incapability and incompetency. First off, the matchmaking system is complete and utter garbage. Getting matched with Russians, Romanians, and Turkish people who have such bloated egos to not even care enough to learn English or getting matched with griefing idiots and autists who have no intent on actually winning. Also, the rank system is so bad, since I always carry every game and the rest of my team is just pulling me down, meaning that I am currently in Gold Nova Master on this account, even though I am LE on the second one, and my trust factor is garbage as a result of that. People will often report me and for some reason even though I'm not cheating and I'm not toxic my trust factor is the lowest of the low, and I get matched with even worse people than usual. No karma system like on ESEA, and even though I'm always determined on winning, it doesn't matter. 

Also, the skins. Valve's method of draining as much cash from it's fanbase while doing nothing to make up for it. It's basically Stockholm syndrome at this point, like seriously. Also, the 7-day lock shows that Valve legitimately doesn't care a single bit about the community, because even though people get scammed every day, Valve still doesn't want to reverse trades or dupe the scammed items, but instead they make this 7-day garbage which will basically do nothing but produce unneeded agony for people who legitimately want to trade. People around me get scammed every single day and nobody is there to stop any of that сгap.

And what the hell is this free-to-play thing? People can buy their way into Prime matchmaking? That sounds to me like a desperate way of attracting more people at the cost of hurting it's actual players by introducing cheaters into the game, every non-Prime game is a HvH game and more than enough Prime games are full of cheaters. Maybe Valve should actually improve their anti-cheat so people can play without getting cheaters into their games, just like other free to play games like Fortnite, League of Legends and others do. Maybe add HWID bans to the game too, so people can't play on the same computer after getting banned instead of removing the ability to trade from the account, since free to play cheating accounts usually don't even care about that and they're just going to open another one and do it all again.

So Valve, if you want to keep your players happy, you should introduce language-based matchmaking, player rating system like ESEA has implemented, better anti-cheat, ping lock and HWID bans. If that doesn't happen, I don't see any reason to play the game. Also, Valve has historically been shown to give zero f's about it's actual players since people have asked 4 years ago for things like unranked 5v5's for example which never happened.

My review is going to stay negative until some actual change occurs, which knowing Valve is going to be - never.",True

2767,"[b] Counter-Strike: Global Offensive [/b]

CS:GO, 4th episode of CS... ( Counter-Strike, CS:CZ, CS:S, CS:GO)
My rating 9/10
CS:GO is FPS Game, i think, that everybody knows CS, so we can move up to negatives and positives!

Positives:
[b] Skins [/b] (You can earn or lose money on skins, u can buy skins, trade skins, open cases and EARN money from that, almost same like TF 2, but much way better!)

[b] Ranks [/b]   - In game are few choices of types in game, From Arms race to competetive matches, when u must communicate, be skiller etc.  When are u playing competetive, and u are winning, u will earn new ranks, u can drop cause losing, or rank up if u are winning. U can start on Silver I and after 100h u can be global elite (Global Elite is the biggest rank)

[b] Gameplay [/b] - Everything is smooth, good, awes00me. :D This is the main change i think, from CS1.6 and GO... everything is smoother, better headshots, competetive and more... its a really great game, not like CS 1.6...

[b] Tournaments [/b] - If u are very good, and u got very, VERY good team, you can sign to the tournament, it can be the ""amateur"" tournament (Night cup etc.) or the best,bigger,famous DreamHack, Copenhagen games, EMS etc. U can win skins, money, new graphic card etc. etc. It´s really awesome!

Neg4tives:

[b] Hackers [/b]   - Once per month will show some cheater... but dont worry, Valve and their VaC bans got this^^

[b] RAGE [/b]   - When u are losing, lost your rank, got retarded team, its bad and u are starting to rage:D

[b] Kids [/b]   - This game... some kids buying this, dont know why, but when are u big rank (MG I etc) No kids in your team anymore^^

If u like FPS Games, u played CS before (CS1.6,CZ or Source) You should buy this! Its awesome game!


btw. Sorry for some gramatic fails, I´m from Czech, so i cant speak ENG like a pro^^",True

I bought this game a few months ago, and I must say that this is by far one of the most challenging and beautiful-looking FPS games where one must learn how to work as a team (not run-and-gun) and camp at a place when necessary to avoid enemy fire and win the round by staying subtle, but still offensive! This game is addictive and hilarious at times when you play with your gamer buddies XD. Selling cases and cheap gun skins gave me loads of money to buy other stuff like cards for crafting badges and buying other games that are on heavy discount. Finally, this game paid off more than I paid for it in retail.

0/10 not enough money for skins.

Update: For the actual review, most people have a love/hate relationship with CS:GO and I do too. It can be a fun game to play, it's a good successor to the previous games in the Counter Strike series and one of the most played games on Steam and for good reason. 

To quickly break down some key aspects of the game; casual is something you should avoid, matchmaking is fun with friends and possibly can be fun solo, if you meet a team that is willing to work together and win. 3rd party matchmaking services provide better options for servers, such as FaceIt or ESEA and you may be able to compete for prices and have a better experience, however some services are subscription based. 

The balance of the game is generally on the right line, except for a few updates that can be hit and miss, but Valve have shown they can listen to the community and fix aspects of the game. The main con of this game is probably the players themselves, as everyone is unique and has different opinions, playstyles, reasons to play and their outlook on how to enjoy the game. Communication can be a problem if someone is unwilling to listen to teammates due to personal opinions or lanugage barriers, and may impact on the outcome of the game. 

TL:DR, Buy the game, it is fun and you will meet new friends and have fun, you might get frustrated at times but this is mostly due to other people.

2800,"First of all, note that graphon really managed. And not even in terms of the ""cruisey"" hi-endnote graphics, but in terms of quality of work of designers, mappers, modelers, and others. Because the maps look really good, modelki weapons and players are also good (that is, in fact, they just made qualitatively and of themselves are good, but look if they do well in this game is another question) - in short, graton I liked, despite the fact that generally Counter Strike is not a game where important grafon. At least, there is no such flatulence, excessive brightness, as in Source - graphon GO just a nice, where you have the gloomy, where it is bright. In General, good graton, normal, pleases the eye and the stars from the sky is not enough. And the map is very good. That is, as.

Most of the maps in GO are copies of classic maps from 1.6. However, in contrast to the same Source environment and the design altered almost completely - if the Source just got my texture, added normal Sormovsky features like lying all over the map garbage, there is virtually completely redesigned the concept and idea cards, leaving almost intact the original structure of the map. For example, de_dust2. In 1.6 and Source is a common Eastern city with pointed domes and intricate paintings a La cartoons about Aladdin. In GO, this map looks like a very levels of some CoD 4, because now this is not the tale of Aladdin, but rather dilapidated streets of, say, Syria. In this respect GO a head taller than their predecessors, meaning you have a lot of attention in the cards given to the parts that compose positive impression.

In this respect GO a head taller than their predecessors, meaning you have a lot of attention in the cards given to the parts that compose positive impression.

All salt that GO missing... Like to call it, nanowaste. 1.6 was very simple, very cozy, home to some; Source immediately I did not like - but even he was closer to 1.6. GO looks more like a reincarnation of some Kalouti in the setting of Counter Strike, but not the reincarnation of 1.6, which oldpage will cry tears of joy and childishly happy face to fill the REP, laying bombs. It rather smacks of a banal desire to cut money for the same game for the third time, as would be sad as that sounds

Another thing I want to say - GO is very ambiguous in terms of its scall. I.e. developers, for example, wanted to add in a new game mods from the old games that were very popular. This well. But they added for some reason only the GunGame mode - it is here we must pay tribute, implemented well and about no less popular ZombieMod, DeathRun, JailBreak somehow forgot. It seems that the developers do not know how to make the game was close in spirit to the original, but it has pleased the fans of modern soulless postrelushka and add a little bit of everything in the blind hope that this trick will work. Now added, for example, GunGame. Here graton pulled. Well. The REP and iCloud too. But what pushed statistics and ranks these fucking. Added new weapon. Why dog on earth, added, everything seems so normal it was. But no - added some idiotic tactical grenades-blende, some Molotov cocktails, which, BL**u, I've never let nobody uses zapili some popsource trailers on YouTube that all so spot on and crap - Oh, what a new counter-Strick soap-cool, go-ka przekazu and get the cannon in TF2. But the whole point of the game is that not myltse, and not even in puschka! Here such pies.

Well, something like that. I think of my words and colour illustrations can in principle be what is no idea of Global Offensive. Actually, to make it even with the beta, then I even review I wanted to write, but somehow it never happened. In General, after the beta, not much has changed. Popisil nasty bugs, added new pictures to the main menu (Oh yeah), all other nonsense - but the game itself remains the same. And even then, at the stage of beta, you can understand what is still feil.

Because Valve have tried to keep up with two rabbits and make a game that would love and ardent fans of the series, and fans of the new-fangled postrelushka. And chip, fellas, that, for example, those lovers of the postrelushka will not find in the ""new"" game is none favorite Blokov or hurricane some gameplay or killstreaks, equipment, single campaign in General, starburst solid, and only. And the old farts in the new game will not find the spirit of the old school, old models of weapons, any hints, rasprygat and other joys of life. And it is not clear to me, boys, for whom this game is made.

And no, I'm not saying this game is bad, not at all, it is able to inspire, and not even for one night, and maybe even someone to buy the box with the game, which will be even smell good - but from the Studio named Valve everybody has come to expect more.

2853,"It is counter strike... a simple point and shoot game.

Counter Strike is in the same realm as CoD (Not BF because BF is total different play style) 

This new counter strike is just a graphics update really.

It feels the same, plays the same, sounds the same, moves the same and has all the same content just the menus changed, graphics changed and new maps have been added.

If you enjoyed any of the counter strikes, then this is a nice step up to modern land.

Literally it offers nothing new besides a graphics update and new menu system with added maps but a majority of them have been remastered. 

The game also has DLC which you pay for like a coin type thing thing to get them. They are not free. 

If you enjoy, jump aim scope shoot headshot in a second then this is the game for you. It is not a simulator and more of an arcade style gameplay.

2884,"Oh boy, now that's a game I have really mixed feelings about....
I'll only share the major downsides of the game so you know what you are getting yourself into and can decide for yourself if it's worth your time.

First of all, people are toxic. What's even worse - you yourself can get toxic at times because of the others around you. From my experience this phenomenon isn't as bad as it used to be back in 2017 for example, since many of the then toxic people were kids, that are all grown up now and know how to act, so you will meet plenty more friendly people than before. That's not to say it's all sunshine and rainbows - you will still have your fair share of stubborn (to say the least) people, especially at lower ranks where they haven't really come to terms with the game.

After a while the game can get really repetitive and boring, even annoying for some. That I haven't experienced myself, but many of my friends have. I happen to really like the style of the game - you may do the same thing over and over, but you not only do it with many different people, which can significantly impact your experience with the game, but you also slowly but surely improve, which really motivates me to continue playing. What happens to some people though is that they either get bored of the game, which is completely understandable, or simply stop playing it out of frustration that they don't seem to be able to improve and climb up the ranks. To that i would say keep playing - I myself was stuck in Silver Elite way beyond the 1000 hours of playtime that I had. Also of course there are those who think that they are way better, and that the rank they have does not reflect their actual skill. To that I say - shut up and prove me otherwise.

If you plan on playing free to play - please go get your head checked out. I myself decided to see for myself how it was going down there in the non-prime zone of the game. Let me tell you - you don't want to be caught dead down there. Of all the games I've played, they were constantly flooded with not just your casual cheaters who at least try to hide it, but the straight up helicopters that are the spinbotters. I would estimate that out of all the people who play non prime, at least 25 - 40% are cheating, and something like 30% are smurfing*. That's not really a great place for new players to start exploring the endless world of Counter Strike.

Those are pretty much the main complaints I myself and friends of mine have had over the years when playing Counter Strike. Overall I really can't recommend against the game - it can be pretty much either really enjoyable and fun to play all the time, or the stupidest and most annoying game ever. That really depends on the mentality you adopt over the first times of playing it. I am no stranger to that honestly - I think that most players who have played for a while have had a period or two of ''I'm never playing this stupid game again"". but after some time you start to miss playing it, and somehow you find yourself grinding it with the same passion you did before. That's really why I recommend it - any game that sticks with you so much you keep going back to it over and over again is worth paying money for.

*For those of you who are unfamiliar with the term ''smurfing'' - that is an experienced player purposely playing at way lower ranks just to get matched with people way worse than them. What happens is that they destroy everyone and continue to feed their ego.",True

I have been so mad about losing my ranks it just gets to the point i want to just quit. but i keep playing and I get better ranks.

2904,"CSGO is a near-perfect multiplayer shooter. Unlike the previous versions, which were often difficult to get in to, this one offers a variety of modes that will appeal to all skill levels. It has a large community and a well supported workshop, ensuring that this discount-priced game will be around for years to come.

In short, you either play as the good or bad guys and must either kill the other team or complete objectives to win the round, which will earn you more money to do the same thing again but faster. It's been around for years and has spawned many imitators.

The game isn't much of a looker as it is based on the same engine as the original Half Life 2 was. However, Valve have polished it as much as they can and the community consists of lots of awesome mappers who have been churning out brilliantly imaginative and beautiful maps almost on a daily basis.

Is it worth getting if you already own Counter Strike: Source? Yes. CSS was always Counter Strike shoe-horned into the Source engine. CSGO feels far more like a standalone game. Valve have very carefully listened to what people have wanted and have made a very appealing game. The best feature must be the competitive play. You cannot leave these matches or you'll suffer a temporary ban from the feature. After 10 wins in this mode you'll be ranked and will be paired up with people of the same skill, meaning that the game is challenging but fair regardless of your skill level. These matches are exciting, occasionally scary or frustrating, but are the most rewarding part of the game and improving your rank is one of the most satisfying experiences in any video game, ever.

There are all kinds of teams and communities that you can join. Really, if I was stuck on a desert island with one game this would most likely be my top choice. It's bigger than you can hope to conquer and has a huge community around it which will likely be around for years to come, something that can't be said for the Call of Duty franchise which is probably its closest rival. Remember that those games are full price and have another one churned out each year, fragmenting the community. Plus you can customise your weapon skins in CSGO. Surely that's the most important feature?! All they need to add now are hats and you might as well live in CSGO.",True

Cheaters should go die in a fire tho. The only real issues are player-made, cheaters, toxic teammates... and I guess smurfs in the lower ranks. Kinda like on every game. Valve is doing a lot to combat cheaters tho, the game has like four different anti-cheats now.

2910,Counter Strike is like having herpes no matter how hard you try to forget you have it. It just comes back to you after a month or so.,True
2911,"CS:GO is very fun strategic game. If you are a fan of games like Call of Duty or Halo where you run around scoped in and dying instantly, this is not the game for you. 

The majority of this game is in the ""competitive mode"" on active duty maps so that is what I will focus on. 

In competitive you play a 5v5 for a maximum of 30 rounds with the game ending at 30 rounds or when a team gets 16 round wins. You can play on the T side or the CT side which you don't get to choose. At 15 rounds you swap sides. The objective of the T side is to plant a bomb at the A site or B site and let it blow up or to take out the other team. The objective of the CT side is to not let this happen by taking out the other team or defusing the bomb after it has been planted. At the start of each round you buy weapons, grenades and Kevlar with money. The amount of money you have is determined by many factors but the main ones are if you won or lost the round before. To win the game strategy and teamwork is key. On T side you will need to decide which site you will take and how you will take it e.g. Slow push mid to B. On CT you will need to decide how you will protect the sites e.g. 2 B, 1 mid, 2 A. Another vey important part of this game is communication. First off make sure you have a microphone and headset so you can talk to your teammates. This is the most effective way of communication in this game. When you are communicating remember to be as effective as possible. Finally if you want to get good at this game you need to practise. Don't think of it as homework, think of it as homework with guns so it's ok.

So if you are think about getting this game what I listed above is the majority of the game. Thanks for read and I hope this has convinced you to buy this game.

Note: There are also skins which you can spend money on. They do not affect gameplay but make the guns you will be using look a lot nicer. Invest in skins if you think that looks are important.",True

Cheating is big problem i find that people in low ranks like masterguardian or DMG have a hard time to play i try to play in low ranks on my smurf belive me its hard to kill them then lem or supreme so many cheaeters that thers no point to play this game in one  month 500 000 VAC ban.I have a feel that Valve dont give shit they care only about update like new skins like new map or new box with skins only money and profit.  After 4 years we still play on 64 tick thats  so low from Valve i mean 8 000 000 people play this game WTF, can you do sometning write for the players give us quality that we deserve .At the and its good game  if you have premade, if you are playing solo thers no way will get to some higher rank thats my opinion.I still thin that this game have future to be more popular than it is but Valve need to decide are they going for quantity or quality ....

2956,"-It is a great game in all respects, but what makes it harder is that there are hundreds and thousands of hackers, and the valves do little to do anything to improve the anti-hack security system!

-I started to play CS: GO in the summer of 2015 through the month of July at the initiative of some friends, and I can say I'm not sorry to have moved from CS1.6 to CS: GO, we played CS1.6 by 2009, being part of a clan called ""AKATSUKI"" until 2010 when we broke up. I've continued to play ""solo"" on public servers until 2014 when I paused for almost half a year, then I opened my first Metin2 server and actually did not have time to play anymore . After selling the Metin2 server at a fairly good price from my point of view, I went back to CS1.6 and continued to play until 2015 when I went to CS: GO and I can say was a real challenge at first, it was difficult at first to get used to the ""new gun"" system, especially the AK-47 :)) until I got my AWP and I thought CS: GO to become a good player if not really good ♥♥♥♥♥ AwP, so in competitive games I prefer to play more with AwP and I can say that I am a good player now with AwP if on 1.6 was the ""pallet"" at AWP.

-The second difficult thing was to get used to the new texture of the maps, if on 1.6 I preferred the badboy way I always went ahead without checking the corners all the time on CS: GO changed the strategy completely and carefully check every corner, to be sure :))

- The only thing I did not like at first on CS: GO was the fact that I saw the skin after which everyone is crazy and is able to have a knife or a dragon lore, I would have preferred to be left at 1.6, default without skin, one would have seemed more interesting, so there would not have been those scamms or thefts of steam accounts, but from what can be seen today, the money chase is bigger than the pleasure of creating a game and giving it to play so ♥♥♥♥♥ would be in real life, I'm not a 100% fan of skins although I have a few that I like for it matters more to the game than some pixels.

-Yeah and that was my story about CS: GO and ♥♥♥♥♥ I started playing.

-Recommend with great pleasure this game.

The gameplay in Global Offensive is similar to that of previous games in the Counter-Strike series.

Gambling: The introduction of the Arms Deal update in August 2013 added cosmetic items, termed ""skins"", into the game. Skins would have a rarity and other high-value factors that influenced their desirability, and these soon became used as virtual currency and the creation of a number of skin trading sites enabled by the Steamworks API. Some of these sites began to offer gambling functionality, allowing users to bet on the outcome of professional matches with skins. In June and July 2016, two formal lawsuits have been filed against these gambling sites and Valve, stating that these encourage underage gambling and undisclosed promotion by some streamers. Valve in turn began to take steps to prevent these sites from using Steamworks for gambling purposes, and several of these sites shut down as a result.

Professional competition
The Global Offensive professional scene consists of both third-party organisation hosted tournaments, and Valve organised or co-sponsored tournaments, referred to as majors. Majors are notable in that they have larger prize pools, which are crowdfunded by the Counter-Strike: Global Offensive community via the in-game purchases, such as keys and special in-game cosmetics.",True

3011,"Countless allnighters come to my mind when I hear the name ""Counter-Strike"" That game is something I'll remember discovering during my middleschool years. It to me, and i'm sure others, was a great way to escape and unwind after a long day. I don't see it slowing down in that department with Global Offensive. It combines the old with the new and I will admit that there is indeed a learning curve when it comes to aiming with those weapons but all it took was a few rounds of deathmatch and then I could effecetivly kill without being the ""bambie"" so to speak. 


Don't think this game is all gold and now scuffs. This game sure does have its short comings but that goes with any top notch game. Unless you're standing still and throwing grenades, you should compensate for the movemnet of the nade. I understand that this use to be something in Cs.s and other titles but I feel it's more apparent in Global. The balistics are far better than previous Counter-Strike games IMO,and it's interesting to see how the different guns have different spread and penetration, etc. 

This game is fantastic to play with friends, or if you're looking to make friends this game is still fun to play. Don't forget to practice if you're having a hard time with aiming, or understanding the map.",True

3013,"I ve spent 1000 hours competitively in this game. And I am still not sure how to play it properly. I tried to be the best teammate I could, concentrating on communication, logistics and team coordination. Some called me ""in game leader"", others- ""stratcaller"", but all complimented my calmness and focus. 

Yet I felt as an anchor for my team. My aim and reaction time where mediocre at best, I couldn't clutch, and tilted constantly (though always tried to hide it, so it won't affect the team).  

So I started to practice. Aim, recoil control, tap shooting, tactical movement. And got better. About 2 to 3 %. The laws of diminishing returns kicked in faster that I expected, and any significant change  was negligible. On top of that victory never felt like victory- it wasn't achieved, you never won because of your skill, rather the enemy was weaker and allowed you to win. Yet if you lost- it was always because of you- you were weaker, stupider then the enemy, never on the level. 

I tried to play against better players, but it was for naught. It is a great lie that you learn to play better against stronger opponents. You learn to die better against them. You learn to hate yourself better against them. You learn to tilt better against them. 

And then it hit me. I wasn't enjoying the game. I was forcing myself to play it in faint hope that the next game will be different. That all the pain, all the humiliation will just fade away. I am not Albert Einstein, but the irony is not lost on me. 

I stopped playing outer games. I forgot my true love: narrative driven games. I had no energy to try something new. I was truly lost. So I stopped. 

You must understand, it wasn't some miraculous act of will. No. I just... Burned out, I guess. Cs go chewed me up and spit me. One day I looked at my stattrak Basilisk and asked myself: what the hell am I doing with my life?

3019,"If you don't feel like reading, full recommendation in the last paragraph.

First things first: Counter-Strike: Global Offensive (CS:GO) is EXTREMELY addictive. You might disagree, but that's probably because you're one of those people that just wants to try and be unique so you hate the game because you want to hate it rather than because it's actually bad. If you're playing this game to have a good time, good times will be had. With a bunch of different gamemodes to choose from, there is always something for you to do, whether you're looking for a fun way to spend a few minutes before leaving or if you're looking for an intense match against other players.

The game itself is unique. In the main gametype (competitive), the Terrorists and the Counter Terrorists, face off to see who will come out on top. The terrorists have to plant the bomb in one of the sites, and the counter terrorists have to try to prevent that. If it happens, then they have to try and defuse the bomb in the time given. It takes a lot of time and effort to learn the game, because it involves learning a lot of different maps and the various locations that can be found there, learning how to shoot properly in this game with very unusual shooting patterns, and learning how to work as a team to come out on top.

Learning to shoot in this game involves learning how to stop before shooting, not shooting in mid-air and controlling your spray so that as many shots as possible hit the target. All of these involve lots of practice for people new to the Counter Strike series. You also need to work together with your team. You have to make sure to use your money appropriately for the situation, and determine a buying plan with the team. You also need to develop a strategy for which players will go where to get the bomb planted in the site, or how your team is going to defend the site. You need to learn and make callouts and preferably use the voice chat to make sure your team has as much information as possible. You need to remember to buy grenades and remember that they are an important part of the game so it’s worth spending the money on. Then you need to learn how to use these grenades you’ve got. There is a lot to consider when playing CS:GO, and it’s an enjoyable experience to learn what to do in what situations.

Communication is a really fun and important thing to have in this game. From callouts of enemy players, to casual conversations about Madagascar, communication is everything in CS:GO. Your teammates will depend on you, and you will depend on them and that’s what makes playing this game so fun. You have to be able to trust your teammates to give you the right information, but you also have to know that no intel is 100%. It’s also important that there is no dislike on the team, which you can’t always control because you might end up playing with some of the most annoying people in existence, but if you dislike someone or someone dislikes you, they won’t be playing their best and they might not even be playing at all. 

However, the matchmaking and ranking systems in CS:GO are not very good. In your average competitive game where you’re playing alone, you will often notice that you’re either with some of the dumbest people on the planet or (rarely) that your team consists of some pretty cool people that you might want to play with again. Smurfs (people that buy new accounts to play with people below their rank) are very common, so it’s not rare that you’ll get placed in a game with a player that is supposedly far below your rank and playing like a top player. 

The system for dealing with hackers is still a pain even with recent updates that improved it, because if you get put against a hacker you’re expected to have to deal with playing the entire 45 minute game, even if you don’t have to deal with the result of the game when the hacker gets banned. Also, there is a chance you’ll get put against extremely high ranked players if they queued with someone of a low rank.  On a similar topic, you can’t surrender when your team is obviously being wrecked and there is no chance of success unless someone on your team abandons. I think it’s really annoying to have to play through 45 minute games, even though it tells you at the beginning you’re committing to it, if no one is enjoying the game. It’s a pain, and really just not worth the effort.

The ranking up/down system is extremely painful. You never know how close you are to ranking up, and it’s determined solely by whether you win or lose (as far as I know). It doesn’t take into account individual skill (this is extremely important in matchmaking, since you could get put in a team with awful players and lose because of that), and I don’t think it takes into account how much your team wins by or the rank difference between the players. The rankings are still generally a good representation of a player’s skill (except for the player’s starting rank, but that’s not that big of a deal anyways), but I believe it’s still too vague and has a lack of depth.

A big issue, though it would be a hard one to solve, is community support. When you get banned from competitive because you timed out and couldn’t get back in time, or due to something out of your control unless you want to spend tons of money on it, there is nothing to help you get back in. Although it’s always a temporary ban, it can still be a pain to have to wait it out. It’s pretty unfair at times. Although it’s good that the community is involved and gets to contribute to the game in the form of weapon skins and maps, it’s just not enough to have a good, strong community.

Another thing I really don’t like about CS:GO is it’s community. Of course there are a lot of good people that are extremely helpful, but some people just want to piss you off. I made a thread about the above issue at some point, and there were too many people telling me “if you can’t get back to the game in 3 minutes, you should spend an unreasonably large amount of money upgrading your PC and router”. It’s even worse in game. There are constantly trolls that don’t even try, annoying players that will be abusive in the chats (although you can block that, it’s still an issue in the community) and smurfs and hackers that shouldn’t exist.

A really big issue for me is bots. In competitive matches, a full team is essential and having a player that can’t do anything, and won’t even listen to the ingame commands that control them half the time, is extremely harmful. Sometimes you can’t control when someone has to leave or times out and things like that, and not having a lot of control over how that 5th player does things can easily cause the loss of rounds. It’s one of the worst things in the game to be playing at a disadvantage, because having an advantage over the other team is everything in CS:GO competitive. You also have no decent way of getting rid of them, because if you hurt them, you get banned as much as you would for killing an actual person.

Overall, I think the game can easily be worth $15. Though it does have some flaws, most of them aren’t really gameplay related and I would easily recommend this extremely fun and addicting game. I’d still suggest getting it while it’s on sale, because then of course it’s cheaper and they’re pretty common so you won’t have to wait long, but if you’re really excited to play Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, then I wouldn’t be against buying the game at it’s original price.

The game is most likely one of the worst things to ever happen to me, but if I were able to go back in time I wouldn't change a single thing because I've put too much time and effort into learning the ins and outs of this game that if I were to completely abandon it, I would have wasted 5 years of work. 

I hate this game on a level to which I cannot describe, every single time I remember a pro-play from this game I am inspired to play, and swiftly I will be reminded just how stupid I was to assume that any luck based interaction in this game would go my way. But that's how they trick you, when you succeed in one of the luck based interactions, the levels of dopamine that enter my feeble little smooth brain are unsurpassed, but the amount of pain I feel losing a luck based interaction is similar to feeling my heart implode from just how angry I get at myself for buckling under pressure.

Before long the hate will rise inside you, work and family will seem less important than ranking up, you will discover that somehow you can curse fluently in Russian, if anybody plays better than you they must be reported for cheating, and you live only for your next knife kill... after which you scream ""rekt!!"".

New players should not be afraid of losing their first few games. You will find the skill tree a little messed up. High ranking players often have alternate accounts so they can dominate lower ranks for fun.

If you do decide to play this game competitively (why else would you pick up CS:GO), you will be thrown into an extremely hostile environment where the trash talking is more lethal and game impacting than your bullets.

[h1] Do I buy this? [/h1]
If you have a competitive itch to scratch and are already dead inside, be my guest.

[h1] Long Version [/h1]
I would very much like to say that the art in this game is arcade-like but I cannot deny the fact that over many revisions and visual updates done by Valve, a certain level of realism has been achieved with this game. The 'realistic', gritty military art direction the entire CS franchise takes has been [i] pioneered [/i], tried and tested, and truly timeless.

CS:GO's gameplay is as solid and robust as FPSes come with it's tried and tested arcade-shooter mechanics that made the CS franchise popular with the masses to begin with. There are however, lots of bugs (search up [b] fnatic's Overpass boost [/b]) that pop up every so often. 

The competitive nature of this game is a double edged sword, the community actively searches for bugs to [i] exploit [/i] and [i] abuse [/i] (I'm looking at you mid-air bomb plant) but as a result, bugs are then publicised and made known to the community so we can counter/play around these exploits. (Bugs do not get fixed for [i] quite [/i] awhile.)

All in all, CS:GO fosters an [i] unparalleled [/i] love-hate relationship with it's players. Although it has a [b] toxic cesspool [/b] for a community, little love from Valve in the form of substantial content updates/bug fixes and unforgiving gameplay at higher ranks, CS:GO's unique charm keeps players coming back, abuses the [i] hell [/i] out of them and leaves them wanting more.

3070,"As a huge fan of Valves Counter Strike series, I have to admit that this one, Counter Strike Global Offensive is my personal favorite. Well it is a simple First Person Shooter game with easy and simple mechanics (like almost every FPS game). I found the Single Player storyline interesting and awesome (great fights, and great scenes in general) and I have to admit that I wanted MORE of it when I finally finished it. Although there were many negative reviews and comments about it, and to be more specific, about the mission ""No Russian"" in which you are asked if you really want to play it or skip it, I think that Counter Strike Global Offensive is a worthy re placer of its predecessor Counter Strike Source, which was a huge success for Valve. If I have to mention something that dissapointed me, this is the game's community, which is small and...unfortunately very toxic.

3095,"[b]tl;dr -> Tried this out, eventually opened a few boxes, got some knives and other $100+ gun skins, sold for profit, bought lots of other fun games. Thanks GabeN. 11/10 feeds my digital gambling itch.[/b]

My route to getting this game was interesting in that I was almost completely turned off what is currently (197.4h at the time of writing this review) my most played game. I initially had traded for this game and accumulated around 20ish hours of playtime, only to have my copy revoked. Fortunately, someone was nice enough to gift me this game a short time later.

If you like team-based multiplayer games, gambling by opening boxes, first-person shooters (FPS), gambling by opening boxes, the Counter-Strike series (1.6 was my baby), and gambling, then you will really enjoy this game. 

The aesthetics are very good - the amount of detail in the background, guns, and character models is well-done. The sounds and music are great and add to the intense atmosphere, but I eventually muted the music in favor of my own (usually Ariana Grande's soothing voice while I unleash hell on my enemies; except in competitive where I don't play music). You can even buy custom music packs if you are offered it randomly, however, I don't recommend doing this unless you have some extra cash (or really love a track); you can ""borrow"" anyone's custom music if you want to sample. It's nice that the gun sounds are distinct enough that you can identify what weapon is being fired with enough practice. 

The controls are easy to learn and typical of your standard first-person shooter. There is a very helpful tutorial you can play that shows you everything you need to know (complete with Valve's helpful popup tips). The learning curve is minimal to extreme depending on your experience with FPS games and how far up you intend to climb the competitive ladder (unless you wish to only play casual game modes). I was rusty as I had not been playing FPS games for years (last Counter-Strike title was 1.6, and last FPS was probably Black Ops 2 on the PS3), so I waited until I had 110ish hours of casual play before I felt good enough to play competitive. I haven't turned back since (although I sometimes dabble in casual game modes).

There are a variety of game modes like deathmatch, arms race (kills give you a different weapon, and you must eventually obtain a kill with a knife to win), and classic objective games (bomb plant/defusal and hostage rescue). In casual play, there will be a maximum of 10 players on each team, while in competitive play it is always a 5 vs. 5 format (people who are kicked/dropped will be replaced by a controllable bot). 

Gameplay can be fast-paced and intense, however, at many times (especially in competitive) it can be very slow and equally intense (if not more). Unlike games like Battlefield and Call of Duty, you cannot aim down the sights (ADS) with every weapon; instead, you can only ADS with a scoped battle rifle for either the Terrorist (T) or Counter-Terrorist (CT) side. There are three sniper rifles you can use with 2 levels of zoom. There is a pistol on the Terrorist side that can be switched to burst-fire, and a rifle on the Counter-Terrorist side that can be similarly switched. CT's also have a pistol and assault rifle that starts off with silencer (quieter, more accurate shots) that can be removed. There are a few weapons that can be switched out (ex: the M4A4 for CT's can be switched with the silenced M4A1-S). You can also switch default skins on guns with ones you have in your inventory. These skins can be obtained either through random drops as you play (given at the end of every game) or by opening boxes (this costs money unless you are a trader). You can also obtain skins from the steam marketplace (or even outside it), but I highly recommend you check resources like /r/GlobalOffensiveTrade on reddit to help you out.

In combat, you can crouch, but not go prone. You cannot climb/mantle over objects, however, you can ""boost"" in competitive game modes (where unit collision is allowed) by jumping onto a crouched player in order to reach a higher position. There is recoil in the game, and accurate range plays an important role in determining whether or not you will actually hit your opponent. Bullets can travel through material like doors and various types of cover for less damage. Wearing a helmet will block one shot to the head, however, and other subsequent headshots will result in an instant kill. 

Game matches consist of several rounds (15 in casual, 30 in competitive, best of), and at the beginning of each round you must purchase your equipment - consisting of your primary and secondary weapons, armor/defusal kit/hostage rescue kit, and grenades (smoke, flash, decoy, etc). You can hold one primary and one secondary weapon. If you die, you will start the next round with only the default starting pistol. If you live, you will refill ammo for whatever weapons you are holding. Money is used to buy all items, and money is given to all players depending on their performance (ex: winning side gets more money).

A critical element in this game is the lack of self-regeneration - what you have is what you have. Your health is only refilled when a new round begins, so playing smartly will aid you greatly. I do recommend playing competitive to help you understand the mechanics of the game better - there are generally a lot of nice people willing to help new players. 

Overall, the game is easily one of my favorite in the FPS genre (and this is being raised also as a Battlefield and Call of Duty child) and is even more amazing if you can manage to play with friends. If you are interested in multiplayer FPS gameplay at all, you definitely must check this out.

ABSOLUTELY RECOMMEND!

3129,"[h1]Introduction[/h1]
Playing CS:GO is like being in an abusive relationship. You start playing, you get frustrated, you exit, you see a few videos about the game, you start it back up again; and the cycle continues. This game is not for the easily frustrated, nor is it 'newbie friendly', however if you give this game a little time and dedication, it will pay off.

[h1]Gameplay[/h1]
CS:GO is the latest in a long-running series of fast-paced, first person shooters. Each game is generally focused around Terrorists vs Counter-Terrorists. In every gamemode, killing your opponents will win you the round though there are many variations on this (deathmatch and arms-race). The star of all the modes is of course, competitive. Here there are 10 players in each game and the objective is centered around the bomb which the terrorists carry. Matches are intense and fast-paced with death lurking around the corner for everyone. A single sniper can take out a group of enemies coming down a long pathway, whilst an AK-47 wielding terrorist can blaze through the counter-terrorists with ease. 

Overall the general gameplay in CS:GO is pretty fun once you get into it. There are tons of strategies for each map and each gamemode, and learning these is key to success. 

[h1]Pros & Cons[/h1]

Pros
[list]
[*] Fun gameplay
[*] Highly competitive
[*] High skill ceiling
[*] Great selection of maps and modes
[*] NEED MOAR SKINS
[/list]

Cons
[list]
[*] Very hard to get into
[*] Map knowledge takes time to develop
[*] Can be frustrating at times
[/list]

[h1]Summary[/h1]
Overall CS:GO is a game that I've slowly grown to enjoy more and more. As a naturally competitive person, the opportunity to try to be the best in this game is just too attractive for me to pass up. I'm definitely no where near good, but this is a game that I feel satisfied in getting and I'm going to get better every day. 

If you like challenging FPS games, this one is for you.

3183,"There is nothing much to review about this game - WORLD knows this game batter than me.

What I will do is to highlight the likes and dislikes for this game from my point of view - a 1.6 player.

[list]
[*]What I really liked about this game is that ALMOST everything is new. This gives a fresh something to start with, even for the people who comes from either 1.6 or source community. It is like a merging platform for both of these communities and their representatives. 
[*]The graphics is really good and so as the in game music - as a 1.6 gamer I never really had any ""in-game music"" (so to speak) so this was a good addition - make you feel emotional in a different way.
[*]The guns are really good - people from 1.6 used to complain about the recoil of source and vice versa. Here we get a mix of 1.6 and Source - the recoil is not that subtle as Source but not much like the 1.6. I had few problem in adjusting with it. The guns are accurate enough and each of the category has their own ups and downs. In fact you can play competitive matches using any gun from the list, which suits your style of playing. In 1.6 this was very much restricted to M4, FAMAS, AK, Galil and AWP - which is not the case here.
[*]The statistics are much well maintained here in GO and so as the matchmaking (love it) as a partial noob to this game I still get to play against people who are much like me (and not the real PROS who will kill you right off your spawn).
[*]I also loved the customisation process of your favorite guns(skinning and stickers). Some of these skins are damn expensive, and guess what , people don't care. Besides you can create your own skins and submit it to steam for including it into the community market.
[*]The network is really managed well here - the game is not nearly as much susceptible to bad internet connections high ping and all that - with my same old BSNL connection I could really kill 2 or more people in a round (:O). Technically its a great feature to have in game
[/list]

But there are few things that I did not liked about this game - 
[list]
[*]First of all, lots of in game purchase are coming into play and for that I am a bit afraid. in 1.6 in game money was nowhere to be found and it was a clean and pure gaming experience
[*]There are a LOT of THINGS that people can do with GO , apart from the serious gaming, which might be a point of distraction for the gamers
[*]Some recent ""Cool-down"" property was added for the competitive gamers who has won 2 matches in a day - so the natural progress of the fun is restricted - then you just have to be happy with the Deathmatches and Gun games.
[*]The maps and their physics (such as spamming) got changed to a considerable amount that for older 1.6 players may gt into all sorts of trouble at the beginning of their GO careers 
[/list]

Overall I really liked the game, and as CS 1.6 is slowly dying out from our community I would recommend ever other 1.6 players to to join this game. It's not a copy of 1.6 for sure but it's GO and here to stay.

3184,i just write this  for the badge,True
3185,"If you have experience with the original Counter-Strike, you will not have any difficulty adapting to the gameplay of Global Offensive. Most striking example of the developer's respect for the classic elements of the series is the fact that the speed of the controlled character continues to vary depending on the activated equipment.

Although Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is far from possessing a visual presentation capable of competing with titles like Battlefield 3, the graphical reformulation of the title pleases enough. Classical maps like DUST2 and INFERNO have gained a completely renewed look, as well as presenting alternative paths that help to make the game experience more varied.

The most notable change seen in Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is in their menus and in the way matches are started. Instead of having to go through several windows in search of a server with vacancies, now just choose the game mode you want to enter and wait while the game automatically searches for the best room for you to enter.

Those who already know the series Counter-Strike and have good memories of version 1.6 of the game do not have to be afraid to acquire Global Offensive. The game succeeds in keeping the elements that made the original game a true phenomenon, with the advantage of having better graphics adapted to the current generation.

But what truly destroys the experience in its entirety is that it's free, and not 10€ like it used to be. This gives the cheaters a choice, and that choice is to spend 10€ on cheating software instead, and once an account is banned they simply make a new one :) This is by far the worst decision in Valve history. But I guess it generates more revenue, and Valve isn't known for hosting games for their awards but by how much income they can generate.

But for CS:GO in general, it became less fun when they removed cbblestone. I know a lot share this opinion, and putting cbblestone back might bring more revenue/income. Do it, bring cbblestone back. Remove smurfs, invest in better anti-cheat software etc. Or just don't give a F*** :)",True

3201,"Man. The day I first tried CSGO at a PC cafe, I fell in love. It's why I own a PC from MSI of my own today, and why gaming and FPS titles in general became a major part of my life. Counter-Strike has one of the largest fanbased communities backing it up, which quickly becomes apparent with a quick YouTube or Twitch search. 

If you're only now getting into PC gaming, the first thing you need to do is buy yourself a copy of CSGO, whether you're a fan or not. It's just an unspoken rule. 

I'm grateful for every single person who's played a hand in this legendary title's development, and I know it'll be quite some time before I lose interest in what it offers. You've got the training course, vs. AI, community deathmatch, and ranked matches once you get more serious. The players have created countless surf maps, too, so you'll always have something new to master.

I was introduced to this game late, but I don't feel it's made a difference in my appreciation for it. Counter-Strike is timeless, man. Buy it. Buy it now.",True

You maybe start to realise she's really not as hot as she use to be. 

She never really loved you but she also need you to stick around a little longer. So she'll start feeding you good news, she'll try to change it up, wear new clothes and change her hair just to keep your interested, Oh which you've likely worked for and paid for, for her.

I.E: Deathmatch, gun game, search and destroy, hostages. Also, they have casual, and competitive, so if you're into that hardcore gaming they got you covered.

Ingredients:
1. 6 tablespoons unsalted butter
2. 1/2 cup white sugar
3. 1/2 cup brown sugar
4. 1/4 cup water
5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon
6. 1 pinch salt
7. 5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced
8. 1 pastry for double-crust pie 

Directions:
1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.
3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.
4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.
5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.
6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing.

[b] Counter Strike is old-famous eSport game which is active for years, and the Global Offensive version is amazing, one of the hardest FPS games, most challenging and reflex based game.

3275,"I in all honestly don't play a lot of games on steam. I limit myself to mainly CS:GO, Arma II & III, The Total War series and that is just about it. I don't have a lot of experience with other games regarding first person shooters. But for the usual price of only 10$ CS:GO is a great purchase. I enjoyed playing CSGO from the first game untill now (over a 1000 hours later).

10$ (less while in sale) for houndrads of hours of fun? Who wouldn't do that?

But it's 10$ game. That means it's not better or worse than your average 10$ game. Your shots aren't always as accurate as they should be. Especially in 64 tick servers. (normal MM servers) To avoid such things you can play ESEA or Faceit. These are rankles competitive games. 

I cannot say I only spend 10$ on this game, I purchased skins aswell and continued to trade with those. And now make real money with that. Thus other than it being a fun game, if you're dedicated you can also earn money with this game.

3278," Ah, Counter Strike. It takes me back to to a hot summer day back in 2011 when i pirated half life one and this came with the bundle. Of course, it was 1.6... Well, needless to say i sucked more at this game than johnathan's mom, but i soon grew accustomed to it and then i came up upon this nifty program called steam. I bought it ( when i still had a cast) and i was disgusted by the difficulty but now i'm writing to you as a silver one and after a year or so, i call it progress. ( Dont insult my skills negur ill smoke you quicker than you got your hand in your dick). Well, CS:GO is one of the best games i have ever played and my little ""clique"" seems to enjoy it too. The gameplay, guns, maps, and whetever else you want to name surpass my expectation. If you get this game, get it for the competitive, not casual. This game is subject to numerous updated for stupid stuff due to valve changing all the shit we players complain about. Counter strike is a great way to work on teamwork and it will basiclly change your perception of a true ""FPS"". The weapons require knowledge on how to use them and they also require you to not be a little whiny girl over them.

Fourth and final thing, the deagle: it costs 800$ and you can get P250, which is way more useful, for 300$.

I've been playing CS:GO for some time now, even bought it before all the competetive and skins.

Alright, so the gameplay is fine, nothing to worry about, not that much glitches and stuff that makes this game unplayable.
The main problem here is the community, within every match I play, there's at least 2 russians, and they always happen to be on my team. I'm kind of thinking this is the Russian Simulator 2kxx.

I'm playing this game to enjoy it, to have fun with friends, but at the moment I either go solo or play with 1 other friend, shit hits the fan.

Like I seriously don't understand where all this anger is coming from, why these Russian people are so angry all the time.
Even when you're winning a match you can never expect a ""good job"" in return.
Even if you carry the entire match and 1 russian is bottom fragging, he will, and trust me on this one, tell you that you're a cyka blyat at the moment you can't win a 1 vs 5 clutch because the bomb exploded on 0.1 second.
This most of the time results in a shot to the head, just hurting you, but not killing you.

The 64 tick servers also don't help with competetive and the Russian temper. Shots are on point, but the server just doesn't register it. Like you need to develop some new sort of skill to even be able to aim like that. I feel like it's more a game based on luck if I play competetive. 

And I know, I could play faceit of some sort, but I'm not global elite yet, I need some sort of proof that I can do it, even though rank != skill.

Anyway, I'd still recommend this game, just play it with friends and if you don't have any, block communication with all your team mates at the moment you hear them say cyka or blyat.",True
3333,"3 years since purchase, 1400+ hours on record. Guess I’m experienced enough to write a review for this game. 

Do I love Counter-Strike: Global Offensive? Yes, I do, and I will go on playing as long as I am able to. 
But it is purely a subjective attitude. Too bad there is not a “Neutral” option for the review, and the choice hurts my @ss as badly as getting killed by a camping enemy or blinded by a teammate-thrown flashbang. 
Well, it is a game anyway. Really nice and worth your bucks (Yes, it is) as a game on PC. Powerful engine (Source, been loving it since Half-Life 2), good scenery and textures, realistic physics. Nearly everything a PC game aims to show off. 
But this is not the point. You will not applause for the beautiful program codes. 
Something larger will get to you, or even change you. 

This prettily depicted game is heavily based on online multiplayer, which means it does not have a single-player storyline. Plot, new game + and secrets will not work to raise your total time played. Instead, teaming up and battle with other players is your objective. 
It is a coop competitive game, with extremely intensive PvP. 
You play games for fun, but you may not find it here. 
First, this game is NOT easy. As a First-Person Shooter, it requires more than seeking enemies with your crosshair. Guns here have significant recoils (relative to other FPS games), and spread patterns. You will know where to place the crosshair, AND how to control your gun so that the bullets do not launch themselves from the ground and head toward Mars. In simpler words, you need skills. 
Every game has a community, and when it comes to competitive, consensus demands it to be ugly. It is not nice to newcomers, as people always want efficient teammates. While there is a matchmaking mode (Classic Competitive Mode), the rest are harsh. If you are new to it, you should try single-player with bots (AI) first to get yourself into shape. Or, you may end up being r@ped by the enemy team tactically, and by your own team verbally. Trust me, the words they use are devastating. 
You may have fun with bots, but what is the point in a multiplayer game? You want to play online, and you should, but tread carefully. You need to improve your skill to a certain level to avoid mad screams of teammates. But would you expect this path of improvement to be flat? This is the barrier, the barrier blocking the CS series to the public for 15 years. 

Recommend it or not? I don’t know. 
I present a thumb-up for its graphics, its challenges, and reputation. Nothing more. 

But for those new to it, remember: 
In this game, sorrow is the predecessor, companion, and descendent of fun.",True

3335,"Do you like guns? Crates? Guns shooting at crates? Crates shooting at guns?

If your answer is yes (or even if it's no), you're in luck! Valve has decided to create the next-gen version of their Counter-Strike franchise and added this great game to the fray!

Play with friends, get yelled at for not playing a tactically-perfect manner during the eco round by twelve-year-olds! The gang's all here! Spend your life savings on Stat-Trak™ versions of your favorite guns so you can brag about how many pubs you've ""pwned"" when you should have been working!

3345,"If you're looking for a game review you've come to the wrong place. But if youre looking for a fantastic ravioli recipe you've come to the right place.

Ingredients
- To Make the Dough
375 grams (3 cups) plain flour
1/2 teaspoon salt
2 eggs
1/4 cup (50 ml / 3½ tablespoons) olive oil
1/2 cup (120 ml / 8 tablespoons) water
Extra flour for dusting 


- To Make Cheese Filling
15 ounces (425 grams) container Ricotta cheese
5 ounces (142 g/about 1/2 cup plus 2 tablespoons) ""3 Cheese Italian Blend"" (Parmesan, Romano & Asiago)
Note: grate these cheeses yourself and create your own custom blend.
1/2 cup cheddar cheese
2 eggs, lightly beaten
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon pepper


- Extras
Your favorite sauce for the ravioli (i.e. marinara/ marijuana)
Parmesan cheese
Basil
Fried vegetables
Shrimp
Fish slices
Chicken pieces 
Make the Ravioli filling.

- In a small mixing bowl, add the ricotta and mash with a fork.
- Add in the 3-cheese blend, Cheddar cheese, eggs, salt, and pepper.
- Mix all ingredients thoroughly until you have a smooth, paste-like consistency.
- Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and place it in the refrigerator for about 30 minutes. 

Make the Ravioli dough.

- Crack eggs into a large mixing bowl and beat them with a fork. Add water, oil, and salt. Mix.
- Add 1 cup flour to the bowl. Use a fork to mix the flour with the eggs, water, oil, and salt. Repeat with the rest of the flour. Mix until a smooth dough is formed.
- Clear and clean off a large work surface and dust it with flour. This is where you are going to roll out your dough.
- Take the dough out of the mixing bowl, shape it into a ball, and place it on your work surface. Knead for at least 10 minutes or until it becomes elastic.
- Dust a rolling pin with flour to prevent the dough from sticking. Roll out the dough until it is about 1/8 inch (1/3 cm) thick, or about the thickness of 2 stacked quarters.
- With a cookie cutter or upside-down water glass, cut out circles in the dough (will make about 15-20 dough circles).
- Ball up the unused dough and either roll it out and make a couple more raviolis, or wrap it and put in the freezer for another time. Dough can keep for weeks when frozen. Just make sure to wrap well so that it doesn’t suffer from freezer burn or absorb freezer odor. 

Fill the Ravioli shells.

- Take the ravioli filling out of the refrigerator and place a tablespoon of it in middle of a dough.
- Fill a small bowl with water, dip your fingers in, and moisten around the outer edge of the dough circle.
- Fold the dough in half over the filling, making a half-moon shape. Be sure all the filling stays inside. Pinch the edges together and then seal the edges of the ravioli with a fork. Make sure to press firmly and go all the way around. This will add a “homemade” touch as well.
- Repeat this process for all your dough circles.
- Dust the finished ravioli with flour to keep them from sticking together. 

Form the Shells and Fill Using a Ravioli maker.

- Roll the dough into two sheets
- Place one sheet on the ravioli maker, and form the filling cups.
- Fill with the ravioli mixture.
- Lay the second sheet of dough on top, and roll it out. This will seal in the filling.
- Remove and separate the finished raviolis.

Cook the Ravioli.

- Fill a large pot with water and bring to a boil.
- Place the ravioli in boiling water for 5-6 minutes, or until they float. You can also test for doneness by nibbling on the edges to test.
- If you don't want to make all the ravioli at one time, you can freeze the rest 
- Take ravioli out of boiling water with large slotted spoon and place on warmed plates

Serve it up.
Top with your favorite sauce, grate some fresh cheese over it, and enjoy!",True

3367,"Modern first person shooters do their job well, but Counter-Strike is the series that helped build the scene. At $15, Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is a great extension to that legacy. Counter-Strike: Global Offensive stands as a glowing reminder that quality game design is rewarded in longevity and variety. Valve has not only updated the shooter but has completely outclassed its contemporaries. This is Counter-Strike, whatever the format you choose to play it on, and there isn't a higher recommendation than that. As probably most of the market for this game has already at one point played CS in the past I'd like to write this review with a fresh taste on what this newest installment has to offer, in a tee, a very good, balanced, fun and competitive FPS shooter with some casual modes thrown in. I'm going to keep it short for those that have been following CS since the 1.6 era.

Global Offensive is better than Source for the competitive edge; the maps are better balanced, some improvements to make it slightly harder to use the AWP, and generally better stat keeping. There are no move able props in this either, for example barrels are now static. Certain other subtle things have been done on the CT/Terrorist divide but not much, for example the CTs no longer have weapons that can attach the suppressor. 

For those that are new or relatively new, you'll love the game. It has plenty of modes, mods and maps. A community that just keeps giving and a very easy to navigate menu for playing with your mates. On top of that since CS has such a big following you'll never be stuck for servers. One thing that has made CS so good I believe since day one is it's responsiveness, so bare in mind this isn't a slow-medium paced game, it is definitely a quick one and you'll always encounter people that have been playing this game for a long time. It is the definitive multiplayer FPS shooter in my eyes.

A little news on the spec this would require and it's still low considering todays standards, which is a good thing people on laptops with a dedicated graphics card should be able to play this pretty easily. Bare in mind newbies that if you get this game you'll find yourself dead a lot, I find myself dead alot. There are plenty of 'aim' maps for you to get used to the shooting characteristics of Counter Strike. Buy it, download it, whatever; just get on board and enjoy it. Sure-fire fun for the online enthusiast. 10/10",True

Anyways my wife left me, I sold my house, and am depressed.. but its ok because i bought a dragonlore, a howl, and a doppler factory new butterfly knife that i bought instead of paying for my house.

Turns out prostitution isnt that bad, I mean, its very unsanitary but over all its ez $$.  Just spent more than 100 dollars on cases... got almost all blues and a couple purples.

We have the old maps, and fast aproaching the BETA stage of the Socom Source mod - so you can go back to the old maps, but with the modern engines, better graphics, better intergration...... and all part of the Socom Source project.

If you are in the EU - check out our new server (in alpha right now - but still hugely playable!)

Just head here - and go back in gaming history!!!!

3401,"CS:GO (Counter-Strike: Global Offensive) is one of the best games I've ever played.  Honestly, I was hesitant to purchase it for a long time because I've heard about how hard it is when you're new to the game and even though you will get your ass kicked when you start playing online, you eventually get better and better.  The best way to get better is by playing with the best!  Then, someday after hundreds of hours of gameplay on CS:GO, you'll be the one kicking everyones ass!

There are also lots of different options for gun skins/customization, a marketplace to trade, buy, and sell guns/skins/crates for steam wallet money or to purchase skins you like so you can use them yourself.   There are plenty of game types for online matches and community servers to choose from, private matches, and you can also play against bots so you can get your skills up and practice before going against real people online.  

Overall:  10/10 - IT'S A FUCKIN' AWESOME GAME!  I suggest you buy it immediatly or as soon as possible!  I guarentee you'll love it!

3420,"This game has been gradually decreasing it's player base for the reason of the amount of toxic people in this game's community, which makes everyone who wants to play serious stop playing this game.

There's another thing that i don't like of this game, is that it's very repetitive, for things such as playing many times the same map (Dust II), having to do the same things always, and the small variety of usable weapons, as many of them are useless and can't be used in competitive, which leaves you with the only good weapons (Such as M4A4, Ak-47 or AWP)

But actually, it's a very nice game, if we don't count the things mentioned above, recommended 100% for FPS players!

Now onto the game itself, the ranked system is far from perfect, but so is any ranked system out there. The game has many elements to it which require skill in many different fields, timing, aim, movement, communication and so on. I recommend TheWarOwl's channel on youtube for anyone that is starting out the game to learn the basics and learn to start playing at an average then continue to a high level. I myself don't have the highest rank in csgo, althought i have been playing counter strike since i was very young. This game requires alot of skill to play at its highest level and even pro players get better every day, its almost like there is no skill cap. The game is very fun to play and getting better at it is a very nice feeling of achievment. There are servers all over the worth from america to dubai to australia. Everyone has a good chance for low ping, which as a player from the middle east i very pleased for. If you are a fan of skillful fps games this is a MUST HAVE. Even if you are not a fan of them you will not regret trying out the game because many of my friends that disliked fps games for their entire life have played csgo and are still playing it to this day and enjoy it more than any other game. Also there are many servers hosted out there which do not include only bomb scenario and hostage rescue, just like with any cs there are many game modes out there from bhop, surf,minigames, zombie mod, jailbreak and the list goes on forever to ensure you never get bored.

CS:GO is a game that is compatible with any Operating System on ur computer/notebook, you can play this game on any system (notebook/macbook/imac/computer because it doesn't require great specs to be playable. The Character models and weapons texture can maybe be improved, especially the character models. More variouty would do a great work in my opinion, but some people of course do love the game as it is. The weapon skins and items variouty is amazing in this game, you have many options for every weapon. Everyone is able to find something to his/her personal taste which is a great thing. Also every now and then there is an operation, which gives you a nice badge, more maps to play (u will lose them after the operation ended) but meanwhile the operation u can play anytime on those maps which all look great.

The only reason I don't rate it 10/10 is because many people are so toxic in this game, but to make them shush is just block communication. Many people want to win, and when they lose they become toxic, but sometimes you just can't win because there is always someone better then you!

3453,"Counterstrike: Global Offensive (CSGO) is a coin with two sides.

On one side you get an awesome game, the typical ""kind-of-cs"" gameplay, 
although there are changes which players of previous CS-titles will surely recognize. 
On the other side the game at a whole has become more ""noob-friendly"" - which does not necessarily mean 
the game got worse, but there are some things you will often find yourself complaining about and most 
Counterstrike: Source players will struggle a bit, when they start to play the game.

Your armory ranges from shotguns, pistols and sniper rifles, to sub-machine guns and assault rifles, as well as grenades.
You're going to have a great time trying out different tactics or doing whatever you'd like to, especially in the all new 
5v5 ranked matchup-system, you can now create lobbies and search for certain modes and maps - an awesome new feature!

3490,"Rugby union fans have been starved for authentic video game representations of their beloved sport for years now, with the last truly strong rugby game being Rugby 08. Sadly, Rugby 15 is not the game to break the drought. In fact, it’s an utter disaster.
Of all the various sports that share the ‘football’ classification, rugby union is one of the trickiest for newcomers to wrap their heads around thanks to a myriad of rules and complexities. While scoring points is the same logic as other forms of football—getting a ball across a try line or kicking a ball between goal posts—converting kick-off to try time involves a number of key set pieces.The team in possession of the ball can run as many phases as they like, unless there’s an infringement or they kick the ball. When tackled, the player holding the ball must release it, as players from both sides pile in and form a ruck, which can only be entered from the side. Scrums and mauls can be used to drive the ball across the try line or gain precious metres, while line-out kicks are essential for gaining ground.
In short, rugby union is a tricky game to learn, and developer HB Studios deserves kudos for condensing the complexities of the game into a relatively simple arcade-style control scheme. Unfortunately, for gamers hoping Rugby 15 will be the gateway to understanding union, there’s a lack of a meaningful tutorial, or any specific training modes for the various components of the sport. Instead, you’ll have to learn by way of ten static training screens and in-game control reminders.
For the most part, the controls are all very easy to come to grips with, but it almost instantly comes apart after kick-off. As I played, it became increasingly clear to me that the gameplay stops and starts based on what the player is doing. While it’s nice to be at the centre of the action, it makes for boring rugby, as both sides stand around waiting for you to act.
For instance, at kick-off, your AI teammates only start moving after you’ve fully completed the drop-kick start of play, and the kicker stands stuck on the spot for a second or two before being able to move. Even if you switch players immediately after kicking, it’s impossible to perform cheeky ten-metre starts/restarts that give you the opportunity to gain possession and make easy ground.Similarly, there were times when I pulled the ball out of the back of a ruck and just stood there watching the opposing team stand around, oblivious to my possession until I took a step forward. The best tactics were to deliberately relinquish possession to gain easy metres. I found the most successful and repeatable tactic, regardless of difficulty level, was to perform a box-kick from the back of a ruck to gain ground. As long as the kick stayed on the field and outside of the 22-metre line (where the AI will take a mark), it’s incredibly easy to force a turnover.Basic tackling is as easy as guiding your selected player into the opposing player with the ball. Or any opposing player for that matter, as you never seem to get penalised for tackling players that aren’t carrying the ball. In fact, outside of ruck infringements, I rarely got penalised for anything. Forward passes were never noticed or penalised, whether performed by me or the opposing team, and off-side penalties were only awarded about ten percent of the time.
As for ruck penalties, they’re incredibly easy to avoid. Once the player carrying the ball is tackled, you have to push the right stick into a predetermined sweet spot that rushes from red to yellow to green, then you can take possession of the ball. Attempting to take the ball when the meter is red results in an instant penalty; yellow is a risky grab that may result in a penalty (and is, surprisingly, easier to get away with in hard difficulty); while green is safe to grab, except when the referee erroneously pings you from time to time for a legal grab.
The ruck mechanic is glitchy when in possession of the ball, meaning I had to hit the right trigger to release the ball before attempting to play the meter game. If I didn’t do this, Rugby 15 stopped registering controller input for a few precious seconds. This is a problem that plagues that PlayStation 3 version of the game more than anything else (also outside of rucks). Given the specific way you’re forced to ruck, it’s best not to be in possession of the ball until you’re within ten metres of the try line, so you don’t have to deal with the incredible frustration of losing possession because the game bugs out.
Even on the supposedly hard difficulty, it’s incredibly easy to win back possession in a ruck once you learn the right-stick sweet spot and perfect timing combination.
By far the biggest problem I had with Rugby 15, though, was that it rarely felt as though skill or tactics played into scoring tries. When running with the ball, you can flick the right stick up or down, or twirl the stick around completely, to sidestep opponents, but even that mechanic only seemed to work sporadically for me.
The game seems to predetermine the outcome of specific plays before the animation occurs, resulting in an inability to pass the ball if it decides you’re about to be tackled, or a lack of a sidestep if that stationary player in front of your guy is destined to take you down. Similarly, partial AI control over the player-controlled footballer means that sidesteps and fends automatically occur at the game’s discretion, while players will regularly run off on their own accord, even if they have the human-controlled icon above their heads. It feels more like rugby roulette than rugby union.When you eventually make it to the trial-and-error-style try-scoring mechanic, you’ll discover that there are two ways to score a try. The first, game-encouraged option is to click in the left or right stick to score a try. This proved to be a risky manoeuvre, though, as full-speed players had a tendency to dive over the dead-ball line, resulting in a penalty. Even the opposing team was guilty of this on one occasion, in an uncontested try opportunity.
The second, guaranteed option for scoring a try is to run your player over the try line and wait to be tackled. There’s no option to get a player beneath a try attempt to stop them touching down the ball, and a button for charging down a kick is sorely lacking. While there’s no sprint option, stamina didn’t appear to come into play (despite its presence in the options menu), and pursuing players rarely catch up to a running player, even if their stats determine they should be able to.
There are rare moments where the intended gameplay formula bounces to the top of the heap, and local co-op/competitive play improves the rhythm as it helps get around dealing with the atrocious AI. Local multiplayer has its own specific issues, however, particularly in regard to the weird system of tracking and switching players during co-op.
It’s worth noting the game looks decidedly last-gen, with dated visuals that can become confusing in certain matches where jersey colours are indistinguishable between friend and foe, especially when you consider how frequently players flock in front and behind the off-side line. The PlayStation 3 version of Rugby 15 is particularly ugly, with a lower resolution, darker presentation, plenty of jaggies and a terrible frame rate, to boot. Combine the unappealing visual presentation with the aforementioned game woes, and the PS3 version is unplayable in its current form.When you eventually make it to the trial-and-error-style try-scoring mechanic, you’ll discover that there are two ways to score a try. The first, game-encouraged option is to click in the left or right stick to score a try.

Every low skill competetive game is full of smurfs (players with alot of experience playing in lower level games) and or hackers. Valves overwatch program catches non cheating players who happen to have a streak of good games/plays, and fails to capture the ""closet hackers"" - or people who using hacks, but play a style that makes it seem that don't. 

""Prime Matchmaking"" failed to deliver on it's goal of seperating out cheatings/smurfs from players who wan't to play against players their skill level and have a good time. It was a good idea, worked at first, but if a player can get a program undetectable by VAC, how hard is it for them to buy Prime Ready Accounts, and get access to a phone number?*

Rumors have been spreading on community forums that Valve is in the works of a ""Super VAC"" yet it's been 5 or so years since the games launch, and they yet to deliver on anything more than in game accessories (gun skins, stickers, music kits, GLOVES, pins, etc) and questionable mechanic changes. I understand they want to make money - but who is going to buy their products when no one is around because of the shakey servers and toxic/hacking community.

I'm extremely disappointed in Valve - like many others, this review will get drowned in the vastness of QQ and phony reviews. There is only one way to getting Valve to act...

Boycott all Valve microtransactions. I'm am no longer buying any more products through Counter Strike or any other valve game until they make reforms to match making. When they have they revenue stream in jeopardy - only then will they listen to player/community concerns and start making changes we want/need to see.

For current players, I feel your struggle, hear your cries, and share your rage. Stop purchacing valve skins, keys, kits, pins, whatever. Stop using the community market and boycott all valve micro transactions.

For future players - hold off from playing this game, the current experience will only turn you away and make your want to quit before you have seen the small glimor of light that is the csgo community. As well, don't purchase the game unless you are ready to pay 5$ a month for a 3rd party subscrition in order to have a decent competetive experience.

TL:DR - Game has potential, but too many hackers. Valve doesnt do ENOUGH to remedy the issues...

3516,"Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is a family friendly game, what the title is already telling us. This strategy game will evolve you into a real leader to win against other families. 
There are some gamemods, for example: Casual, Deathmatch and Competitive Matchmaking.
In Competitive Matchmaking you can grab your little sister, your father, your brother and your mum, to build a lobby within 5 people. If you win 10 games, you will get your rank.
There are 18 different skill groups from silver to global elite. Normally you will join the elite after winning 10 games.

3519,"ʕ•ᴥ•ʔ Hallo!

2021: This is an update to my original review. Where do I even begin?

I started with Counter Strike 1.6 in the mid 2000s after getting my first computer. The game was already popular, and everyone was trying to outperform themselves for a sense of achievement. Eventually, I clocked a few thousand hours in 1.6 and made a few friends, and when Valve released Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, I bought this better looking version (offline), which I still think is one of the best team-based first-person shooters out there.

Aim of the game: Two teams compete in multiple rounds of objective-based game modes with the goal of winning enough rounds to win the match.

There are a few things I'd like to mention. In competitive matchmaking, you're ideally queued with players of a similar rank to yours, and so do your in-game opponents, and the overall rank of your team balances out with that of your opponents. However, due to various factors, it ends up being an unbalanced session from time to time, resulting in a very quick win or loss. It's important to have good communication, and if you don't have a regular set of friends to play with on that day or in general, and you're unsure about your ability to carry the team's mess-ups, you can choose to play unranked matches, thereby reducing the commotion. There are other casual modes that are fun to play too. Another thing here is the toxicity that spreads like wildfire amongst teammates and opponents, and everyone takes it out on one another, even if it isn't required, which ends up bringing the overall morale of the team to an all-time low, and people end up throwing the match, making it an easy win for the opponents. You will learn to not take it personally over time, but in the meantime, you can choose to mute them after telling them why. Over time, you will get tired of the 64-tick servers, and sometimes the servers don't perform properly, resulting in a poor experience. Speaking of poor experiences, even after Valve does its best to prevent it, there are always some individuals who end up cheating in-game and ruining the game for opponents, and it's best to quickly end the game and not worry about it much because there is only so little you can do, which is to report the person and then the profile itself. The only ambigious part is the ranking system (Elo) that people have debated over a decade to no proper avail. My suggestion is that you do your best to keep your KDR in the positive, have a decent ADR, and bag a few MVP's. You'll rank up over time.

Achievements aren't all that easy to get, and it takes a few hundred hours to unlock all of them. Some achievements, like 'King of the Kill' or 'Cold Pizza Eater' where you have to 'play 5,000 matches and win 1,000 matches in Arms Race or Demolition mode', respectively, or the 'SAR Czar' where you have to rescue 500 hostages, are kind of pointless, but you'll organically unlock these with some grind, and these are more of a career mode achievement if such a thing exists. The Source 2 engine, which has been much awaited for over half a decade, is still due to be released. There are regular updates to the game and its game modes and operations (purchased in-game) are introduced every once in a while to keep the community alive. However, after 2018's Danger Zone update, Valve made CS:GO a free to play game, and you have to purchase a CS:GO Prime Status Upgrade, which is worth it if you want to play with individuals who are less likely to cheat in-game.

That being said, I'd recommend this game because it has good replay value, a large community, and there isn't a 'pay to win' system. There is a good learning curve involved, and there is no shortcut to good aim apart from practice. As for game sense, well, it develops over time. It should be a positive experience if you have humble teammates who communicate and help each other improve. Do not get mad at teammates if you're better than them, as they might be lacking the hours and experience that you have. Instead, help them by teaching them what you have learnt, effectively reducing the time it takes for them to get better and make a few friends along the way. I've made some good friends through this game in the past few years. Having spent at least $1000 on cases/keys/skins/passes/stickers, I suggest you buy what you like from the Steam market first. Yes, it is fun when you unbox something of high value, but the odds might not be in your favor. I learnt it the hard way. In the end, it is just a game.


Remember: Sometimes your opponents might be having a really good day. Communication is key, even in real life. This is a love-hate relationship at its finest.

There isn't a TL; DR.

There are many other game modes but I only care about becoming better at 5v5 matches. My favorite weapons are M4A4, MP7, MP9, Five-SeveN, P250 and of course AWP.

Other than that, I am not a fan of its art; characters and environment. It focuses on being realistic and looks bland and uninteresting, especially the terrorist team.

3623,"Shrek is a 2001 American computer-animated fantasy romantic comedy film loosely based on the 1990 fairy tale picture book of the same name by William Steig. Directed by Andrew Adamson and Vicky Jenson in their directorial debuts, it stars Mike Myers, Eddie Murphy, Cameron Diaz and John Lithgow as the voices of the lead characters. The film parodies other fairy tale adaptations, primarily aimed at animated Disney films. In the story, an ogre called Shrek (Myers) finds his swamp overrun by fairy tale creatures who have been banished by the corrupt Lord Farquaad (Lithgow) aspiring to be king. Shrek makes a deal with Farquaad to regain control of his swamp in return for rescuing Princess Fiona (Diaz), whom Farquaad intends to marry. With the help of Donkey (Murphy), Shrek embarks on his quest but soon falls in love with the princess, who is hiding a secret that will change his life forever.

The rights to Steig's book were purchased by Steven Spielberg in 1991. He originally planned to produce a traditionally-animated film based on the book, but John H. Williams convinced him to bring the film to the newly-founded DreamWorks in 1994. Jeffrey Katzenberg began active development of the film in 1995 immediately following the studio's purchase of the rights from Spielberg. Chris Farley was originally cast as the voice for the title character, recording nearly all of the required dialogue. After Farley died in 1997 before the work was finished, Mike Myers stepped in to voice the character, which was changed to a Scottish accent in the process. The film was intended to be motion-captured, but after poor results, the studio decided to hire Pacific Data Images to complete the final computer animation.

Shrek premiered at the 2001 Cannes Film Festival, where it competed for the Palme d'Or, making it the first animated film since Disney's Peter Pan (1953) to be chosen to do so. It was widely praised as an animated film that featured adult-oriented humor and themes, while catering to children at the same time. The film was theatrically released in the United States on May 18, 2001, and grossed $484.4 million worldwide against a production budget of $60 million. Shrek won the first ever Academy Award for Best Animated Feature and was also nominated for Best Adapted Screenplay. It earned six award nominations from the British Academy of Film and Television Arts (BAFTA), ultimately winning Best Adapted Screenplay. The film's success helped establish DreamWorks Animation as a prime competitor to Pixar in feature film computer animation, and three sequels were released—Shrek 2 (2004), Shrek the Third (2007), and Shrek Forever After (2010)—along with two holiday specials, a spin-off film, and a stage musical that kickstarted the Shrek franchise. Although plans for a fifth film were canceled prior to the fourth film's release, the project was revived in 2016 and has since stalled, with production and a potential release date getting pushed back.",True

3650,"Is this your first time playing the Counter-Strike Series? Decided to start with CS:GO?
Here is an encyclopedia of certain terms that you will hear in the future in the game.

Pub, public-a place where a noob with a Skin for Five thousand in respect, unlike Pro players with Stock guns
MM-a Place where you will throw out all the water in the form of sweat until you turn blue until the twentieth. After that, the game goes into the ""fuck it all"" style...""
Poles are Famous inhabitants of MM, beings who are dissatisfied with ABSOLUTELY everything that you would not do. Anything. Even if you dragged with 1 HP against five with only one gun. The main thing is not a word in Russian.
Russian-Famous inhabitants of MM and public places, obscenities clog the chat. If you suddenly need information from your Russian ally from random, you will hear something like ""Somewhere there ran"", ""here it seems was"" and ""it Seems here"". After turning 180 degrees and checking some positions, the enemy was behind.
The case Is made of Gabin. You stick in 120 rubles ($1.5) and take out literally pennies.
Skins-Coloring weapons that determine the skill of the player.
Avapa, Avape, AVIPI - If you think that the best training is in combat, then put this phrase out of your head and never run with this sniper rifle, which judging by the movement in the sight weighs 50 Kilos, if not more.
Emka is a Weapon that Counter-Terrorists always prefer to take As a trophy
Kalash-Weapons from Terrorists, which Counter-Terrorists always prefer to take as a trophy

Overall impression of the game\The comparison with the Previous Series, I like about 60-70% Community Contra I play it with 1.6. How does it differ from GO?
- Shooting is more random than in 1.6. You will think that on the sky of any map there is a magnet that attracts bullets. In fact, this is not the case. I checked. Strange, isn't it?
- Grenade physics. Despite the fact that real grenades weigh about a kilo-half, here they fly off like feces on The toilet tiles. Be careful with alternative fire when choosing grenades.
- Physics in General terms. If you suddenly see a terrorist twisted after death as if he does not have a spine at all - do not be surprised. The modified engine allows you to capture the best moments of breakdancing corpses. Don't you believe it? Community GO-Screenshots.
-Graphics. If you think that your girl asks a lot of you (If you have one at all, and you know what a female person is), then you are mistaken. This game will eat up absolutely all your RAM and will give out a puny 100 fps if you have less than two gigs of RAM. Slide show when shooting is provided.
-Weapon. There is a new one. We will have to talk a lot about it. Buy it and see for yourself.

After such a long time of writing a useless assessment, which will only be looked at by two or three people at most, I want to conclude my review with a General conclusion.
The game is very good. If you get used to it after hours so 100, then you will understand what its trick is. But the game is unfortunately merciless to beginners. If you really don't want to get caught by players who think the muzzle of your gun is edible and bite it when you take rush plant together, then you should train your reaction, shooting, throwing, and tactics in General. And remember-never lose heart. This game will eat your nerves as well as mine. The main thing is not to lose heart. One day you will become the same as professional players. The main thing is patience.",True

This game is great even if a lot of [i]cheater[/i] persists (again), the grade system completely exploded to completely review.
Not to mention the fact that we can bump into players who have absolutely no level of our level (falling against silvers by being myself mg2, therefore they had no chance, and on the next part I fall with dmg, therefore I blew up Lol).
Otherwise the graphics are bof but for a game like [b][url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/730]Counter-Strike: Global Offensive[/url][/b] do not need graphics like [b][url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/489830]Skyrim[/url][/b].
The skins and musics kit systems are well thought out, despite their exorbitant price, which creates a real economic system with the Steam community.
And I think we all agree that having passed the Free-to-play game is pretty cool but the [b][i]CS: GO Prime Status Upgrade[/i][/b] is completely useless, especially since it is available for free at [b][i]level 21[/i][/b] of the game.
Finally, I would add that the operations make you want to play fully at [b][url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/730]Counter-Strike: Global Offensive[/url][/b], so putting as much as possible would be really cool, well that’s just my personal opinion.
In short I would end by saying that it is a very good game but that we must completely review the system of rank and and of the anti rich.
If I had to put a note on 100 I would put :
- 16/20 for the gameplay (because there are still some things to review)
- 12/20 for graphics (because they are not disgusting either)
- 18/20 for the game economy system
- 15/20 for the skin system, Musics kit etc... (20/20 for the idea but I remove 5 points because the prices are really exorbitant)
- 02/20 for the system of rank and anti cheat (because simply rotten and I give nevertheless 2 points because there is when a little bit of work on it)",True

3744,"CS:GO has been the most liked & popular new FPS title released in the Counter-Strike series ever as when I began playing in Q4 2017, I really liked it in terms of overall gameplay with the introducing of new features like competitive skill groups, ranking system, in-game used buying & selling of weapon cosmetic skins on the community market in addition to other virtual items but I must say that the VAC system isn't any good as the cheats ratio's too high in matchmaking servers whether you play non-prime or the prime as well as on any third party popular platforms like Faceit free or premium both & so as ESEA has its private cheats scattered all over the web in the form of cheap monthly subscription tiers so basically the cheats are always there in CS:GO no matter where you play, I'd say Valve should take it seriously in trying to improve their Anti-Cheat system because the Overwatch system's also useless & too slow as the cheaters don't get banned on immediate basis & moreover nobody watches Overwatch cases anymore. Lastly, if you guys still don't believe it then watch this video below yourself as it's been the current state of CS:GO till late 2021 since the release of 2012 like most of the cheaters are actually never get banned & get away easily with expensive inventory items & higher Steam levels!

3766,"[b]Counter-Strike: Global Offensive[/b] is a really addictive Game which needs skill, understanding, patience and aim.
There are 6 different game modes to choose for. No matter if you rescue the hostages, defuse the bomb, play with one of your friends in 2 vs 2 in wingman or dangerzone, play deathmatch to train your aim against random online players or if you just play arms race to test your skill with different weapons. 
The main game mode is competetive and let's you face your team of 5 players against another team of 5 players. The two teams are called Terrorists (T's) and Counterterrorists (CT's). The CT's have to defend the two bomb sites against the Terrorists, who want to plant their bomb on one of the bomb sites. You need to have good headphones and a good microphone if you want to win, because if you or a mate can't give any info, your mates will probably die, because you or a mate didn't gave them the info that someone was there. It also helps if you know the calls for the maps, so everyone knows what you mean. CS really puts  pressure on you and some people aren't making it easier, while screaming at you. But the good thing is that that valve added a mute button, so you can just mute annoying russian kids who are not calling anything and speak in their own language with other russians, because they are too lazy to learn english like other normal people who try really hard. Instead of giving you proper callouts they ignore you and talk via game chat with their russian fellows instead of adding them on discord and talk there, like every other normal not mentally r*tarded person would do. CS runs smooth on almost any toaster out there. Even on high settings you can get around 60 frames per second. It offers you a vast variety of strategies and never gets boring, because you're always playing against different enemies and get new mates who you can get friends with. Just download it and check it out yourself for free. Thanks for reading my review and I hope you have a lot of fun like me and many of my friends. Don't forget to like and comment.",True

I might suck at CS:GO but i've had so much fun playing this. The wide variety of modes really makes it enjoyable even if i have like 30 minutes to play. That said thye competitive side of the game isn't really for me that much, ranking up is getting harder and harder since the skill level is getting pretty high these days, but seeing your win count go upwards is always nice i guess. The updates to the maps have been pretty cool, however a lot of maps got deleted from competitive play because not that many people played on them (including my favourite, ""Black Gold"") i really wish they could bring that back.

It is very sad to realize that this is happening.
Earlier I could play it day after day, not noticing some flaws, hoping for the implementation of all the promises from the developers of the game.
But now all these promises have hung on me and the whole community of the game, and they are not being implemented.
It's worth saying that the game took away from me not a little time of life and yes, I was happy with everything that happens until recently (as well as the rest of the game community).
The problem of cheaters, 64 tick-rates, in-game problems with communication and toxicity of players.
We will close our eyes to the team and toxicity, because these people are only 1 game, and you can also try to solve this problem.
One can work around the problem of 64tr.
Going to a third-party platform, like FACEIT and ESEA.
But the problem of cheaters was and will be, until the developers seriously take care of it. But looking at their ""zeal"", they will not do it soon.

3855,"The Good
This is one of my favorite games of all time, definitely my favorite fps ever, csgo is an online 5v5 competitive shooter where you play as both counter-terrorists and terrorists in a 30 round match. There are two major game modes with plenty of unique and memorable maps for you to play and improve on. Csgo does this amazing thing where you play it and you are completely awful at the game. Unlike COD, it has no mercy for those who can not get the fundamentals of the game down, the main 5 being movement, aiming, shooting, map knowledge and team work. This game has such a huge skill gap between the new players and the experienced players to where it can be intimidating for new players to try and play; however, the game has a great balance with their weapons to where new players can use weapons that require relatively lower skill to use and the old players can use the more challenging weapons to master, making it to where everyone can enjoy the game. The game is hyper-focused on how well a individual can do and it is a great thing. Not even mentioning the amazing teamwork possibilities. Put in the time in this game and you will learn a lot about yourself and skills you can apply in real life which is something very few games can do.

Background
However the game is not a perfect game, yet it comes close. Now before I criticize the game I just want to state that I own this game over 5 accounts with over 2,500 hours clocked online. I have a very good understanding of this game at the highest levels (non pro, rank G/A) on 3rd party platforms such as esea and faceit and I have climbed to the very top of the ranks on Valve's matchmaking. With thousands of games played over years of playing I can confidently say that I have legitimate grounds to review this game on.

The Bad
- MASSIVE CHEATING PROBLEM!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Around the rank DMG you will notice an massive increase in cheaters and at that rank and above there is not a single game you will play where there is not a cheater.
- A good player with good aim will realize that the shot registration can be odd at times, even watching professional level games on 128 tick servers and 0 ping, the shot registration will simply not work
- A good player can NOT carry for victory, one player can lose the game for you, but a good one can't win it for you
- There are just several blatant visual draw distance issues on several maps which is kind of annoying and unacceptable for a game in 2018 with this big of a player base
- Jumping is very inconsistent, bopping is not viable because of this which is fine because the game isn't focused around this and you can go to the community servers to bhop. Where the problem arises is when you want to throw a smoke that requires a jump, and it is inconsistent without a macro and macros can be considered cheating 
- In my opinion, some of the guns need major buffs and nerfs, especially the under-used weapons and pistols.
- There is a complete lack of tutorial for this game vs. games like quake live, so it makes it harder for new players to enjoy the game which hurts the game if new players lose interest because of the difficulty
- Most of the casual game modes are just boring and the big operations are scarce
- Skins in the game are blatantly overpriced and the odds of getting anything you want from cases are so slim that it is a waste of money
- The updates to the maps feel like they are lowering the skill level for movement which is very disappointing for players who put a lot of practice into their movement
- Prime requires you to be level 21
- No unranked matchmaking
- The cooldown system has a lot of issues that could easily be fixed
- The replay system is awfully slow 
- Overwatch is accessible for low ranked players which is the single most idiotic thing I have ever heard of. It is obviously not a good idea to give the ability to ban players to people who can't get past gold nova, I have gotten overwatch banned before because of this and it is really not fun being banned because some gold nova 3 thought you were cheating.
- Low tick rate servers

Summary
Those are just my main gripes with the game, but honestly even with those flaws the game is still one of my favorites, an easy 10/10 for me as this game has taught me a lot of skills I can apply in other fps games, but more importantly I learned a lot about teamwork, my mentality to playing competitively and learning from other players who are just better and dealing with the reality of my own ego while reaching the highest ranks the game has to offer. It is truly an experience I will never get from any other game; this is the game that has ruined all other games for me for a very long time until recently I was able to put it down. It is a game I can always come back to and enjoy every time and I already know within the next year I might inspire myself to push even further than what I thought was possible skill wise, but until then I will enjoy the game casually.

3867,"Even though CS:GO gets a lot of negative reviews and many people call it a ""dead game"", it's still the best First - Person shooter I've ever played. It's a very extensive game; there are many gamemodes (from valve itself and many community-made as well) that keep you playing. 

Many people are criticizing the game because of the high amount of cheaters, the low amount of operations, the hitboxes, etc...


[h1]Cheaters:[/h1]
I guess everyone who played atleast 15 competetive games, already met a cheater. Sometimes they get banned within the same match, sometimes they get banned a few days after you reported them and sometimes they didn't even get banned after 2 months. In my experience, everyone I met who cheated 100% (looking obviously through walls, Trigger-Aimbot, etc.) got banned at the latest after three days, so I never really had much problems with that. Every half year there's a ""Ban-Wave"" coming up where thousands of accounts from cheaters get banned at the same time.

[h1]Operations:[/h1]
Operations in CS:GO are like DLC's which you can buy to get a Operation Coin, which you can level up from Bronze to Gold (in newer Operations you can even get it to Diamond). After buying the Operation Pass you can get weapon-skin drops by leveling up. These can be sold on the community market. To level up you have to complete missions, either in solo or in coop. The coop missions are the most fun in my opinion and sometimes they can be very tricky to complete. When operations first appeared in CS:GO, they happened multiple times a year, but at the moment we can be happy if we even get one in a year.

[h1]Hitboxes:[/h1]
I started playing Global Offensive in 2015. As far as I remember the hitboxes were way better then than they are now. Everyone is complaining about the hitboxes and I completly agree with them but I think in many cases it's really not the hitboxes which cause you to miss the shots, it's the servers and their performance. Maybe one day we get 128 Tick servers.


[h1]Conclusion:[/h1]

In my opinion, CS:GO is definitely worth buying. There may be big Contras but they aren't as bad as they sound. Ever wondered why there are so much people complaining about this game and it's problems but they still play it? It's just because it's still a very good and well balanced game. With it's many gamemodes it just doesn't get boring that fast.

3870,"● I played Counter Strike Global Offensive a lot.. Even on my 2 accounts.. i Have in total like 600 hours of this game..

I can can certantly say that the game is very good, and you will have much fun playing it.. especially with friends..
But.. There is some positive as well as negative facts that i have to appoint.

● First of all the game is managed with time. You play you learn you get better and more skilled, so you will have to spend some time to learn Spray Patterns.. Recoil.. The Tactics.. Stuff like that.. So dont think you will get pro in 2 hours.. 

● Of course i have to say the enormous quantity of toxic players in this game.. There are a lot.. Toxic Players.. Cheaters / Hackers / Script Kiddies.. And the noobs of course..
So i guess Va♥♥♥ need to spend some more time to fix this.. Because a good game with bad players never went so good..
If Va♥♥♥ want's to bring up CSGO again.. Then they have a lot of work to do.. ♥ A new CSGO Operation will be good ♥ Just Kidding.

● The skins.. Oh yeah the skins.. 80% of the profit that V♥♥♥ gets with this game is for the skins.. Of course they're not bad.. For someone the skins are quite a good thing but for others.. yeah i keep this fact for you and you decide.

● Concluding CSGO is a good game.. But you have to spend time to learn it. Its a great strategic game too..
● Bring some friends to play it and have a nice time in this game ♥

3888,"I have been playing this game for a while now, and it has been great! I have gotten really good at this game. I try and tell my friends at school how good i am. But they don't believe me. So i loaded my dad's ak47 and tried to take it to school. But my mom being the negative nancy that she is, would not let me take my dad's ak47 to school. So that caused me to get made fun of for my lack of skill in counter strike. So i snuck my dad's ak to school, made a list of people i wanted to show how good i was at counter strike. I was in the middle of spanish when i whipped the ak out and started bussin' heads. The school went into lockdown mode when i started to get nervous and thought i should just stop. But i learned from Ibuypower that i should never throw a match, so i went on with showing my counter strike skills. I went out of spanish with a 5k. Looks like the other team is on eco, haha.

so i have to say that overwatch is a good game but still i would say irelia needs a nerf.
my personal main is hanzo so this is my jhin guid: click if you see a minio on low life. but if minion is to near to tower you have to run away. if you see a player  just run for it since you have like 5 hp but if there is a other champion from your team you have to ward your own tower so the enemy doesnt destroy it without you noticing. as soon as the timer hits 5 mins you have to go and execute urself otherwise the handymen come out of there camp and kill u. my favourite build is the warder so you have to buy 5 sightstones and 1 yosogamis dustblade. Pro tip surrender the game just before you destroy the nexus for extra salts. after the game finished be sure to report the enemies and write ggez to show your total dominance. if the top of the screens scoreboard says this: 2/17/7 you know aou are good since it is better than me and im bronze 5 wich is better than Master.

It might be a little difficult at first and everyone seems to be really good. Don't worry about it. Just learn to aim with pin-point accuracy, a few tactics and you'll be good to go! Put the time and effort and it will show :D

The only thing that I WISH they would work on is eliminating the hackers. It's not fun playing against players with wallhacks and aim assist.

The female population on CS:GO is extremely small ><

3995,"Zacznę od kwestii organizacyjnej. Mianowicie jestem fanem Counter-Strike'a w odsłonie ""klasycznej"", czyli 1.6. W tę wersję grałem latami i do niej mam sentyment. Wszelkie późniejsze próby (CS: Source, Condition Zero) stworzenia czegokolwiek z tej marki uznaję za głupotę i bezsensowne grzebanie w dobrej produkcji.

No dobra, swoje powiedziałem, ale świat idzie jednak dalej, a stary CS jest już naprawdę stary. Na Global Offensive postanowiłem więc spojrzeć nie tylko przez pryzmat napisania tej recenzji, ale ocenienia, czy oto przyszedł godny następca dawnego króla.

Z grami takimi jak Counter-Strike w ocenie jest pewien problem, bowiem to już przestają być gry. Mamy tu do czynienia z platformami e-sportowymi i oceniać je to tak jakby oceniać na przykład piłkę nożną, w której dochodzą nowe usprawnienia (ot, jak chociażby nowy system wykrywający, czy piłka wpadła do bramki, który wykorzystany ma być podczas Mistrzostw Świata w Brazylii).

W ogólnym rozrachunku Counter-Strike: Global Offensie to próba odnalezienia złotego środka pomiędzy wygodą gry, a wsparciem dla ogromnej zaangażowanej społeczności. Nikt nie wybaczyłby Valve, gdyby ci zabronili tworzenia i wykorzystywania modów oraz własnych map, zaś nowi gracze mogliby poczuć się zagubieni w gąszczu niejasnych oznaczeń serwerów i konieczności pobierania dodatkowych plików przy nieoficjalnych grach. Problem rozwiązano więc dosyć skutecznie - grę podzielono. Już z poziomu menu wybieramy, czy chcemy bawić się na zasadach przyjętych ogólnie, czy wchodzimy w dzicz prywatnych serwerów i setek przeróżnych modów.

4006,"Counter Strike : Global Offensive is no doubt my favourite FPS game so far. Excluding the outdated engine that the game is currently working on it still gives one of the best Multiplayer FPS experience that an FPS fan can ever get. in my opinion i would buy this game rather than Call of Duty since it is cheap and there is no anoyyin DLC that you need to buy on order to get full experince out of it which also makes CS:GO > CoD.

Basiccly the game is about 2 enemy groups : Terrorist also known as T's in short and Counter Terrorists also know as CT's in short and both team has a different objective and everymap has its own objective for example in some maps the CT's have to defend bomb sites A and B from the T's trying to plant the bomb. If the bomb is planted the CT's have to rush to the bomb site where the T's planted the bomb and elimate all T's and defuse the bomb. If the CT's manage to defuse they win the round but if the bomb goes boom ... than that a win for the T's. That was demolition mode, than there is a Hostage scenario ojective. Basicly on a map there will be around 3 -4 hostages scatered in a certian area on the map and the CT's have to go and rescue the hostage's by going to that area grabing a hostage and leading it to the CT side spawn point. As for the T's they have to keep the CT team from rescueing the hostages. Simple , yet fun and addictive.

The game itself is very fun to play altough it does have a very bad hitbox ... sometimes you shoot directly on the enemy player and it counts as a miss. Its a preety anoyying bug that occurs almost every game for me but it is not enough to ruin my competitive experience. That basicly the most anoyying thin in CS:GO that can happen to you.

It is a very tactical game especially during competitve matches because it invloves communication , callouts and teamwork. All maps have there own nade spots which can be learned from watching alot of tutorials on Youtube and that make's the game even more fun to play and also tricky. 

I mostly play competitve matchmaking and i haev been around the CS:GO community for a decent amount of time and overall i can say that the players in CS can either be toxic or very fun to play with. The higher your rank is the more ""mature"" the audience is gonna be and your less likely to get matched with someone who is just plain Sh**. I suggest that you either form a team of 5 real life friends with a DECENT headset to hear enemy footsteps.

in conclusion the game is very very very awesome and if you get the hang of it 500Hrs can be easily reached especially if you play alot of competitve since 1 game takes about 30-45 mins.

Good Luck and Have Fun spraying down your enemies and landing a straight headshot :P

4033,"The classic formula - tried and proven.

For those who are more familiar with the 'modern fps' genre, CS:GO may seem like an obsolete hipfiring fps from the last decade, but there is a certain charm with this title, namely the 'strategy' and 'reflexes' part which is less oftenly seen in mordern shooters.

At casual levels, this title is great for just going in-game for 10-minute blocks of casual deathmatch shooting, a quick and easy way for stress relief or just taking a break from work.
At competitive levels, this game plays less like 'pew pew pew' and more of 'A site or B site? Save? Eco?', with more focus on strategy and communication rather than being the quickest gun in the wild west.

Overall, a very satisfying game for a very low price.
Nothing beats the feeling of saving a win for the team when seriously outgunned as the last surviving member of the team.

Some people complains about the toxic players and afks. But those should think about how big is the valve and counter-strike community. I found it balanced.

Rank System has got some issues like, players don't know their elos or their points, this is a big one. Cause if we dont know where we are on the league or rank , we cant calculate that the how is the next win or lose going to effect our rank.
But in the otherway, Great matchmaking, gold plays with gold and silver plays with silver. ( Except the boosters, no one can predict or do something about them )

Hackers, as always been a problem to CS series. VAC Ban is good but must be more regular. And Valve put players in a important place that its called the ""Overwatch""; The players that have some specialites ( rank, hours spent on game , win ) , qualifies to being Overwatch. In Overwatch those players can watch the reported gameplays and decide to ban the suspected players from the servers. If they re good in this, they keep their Overwatch status or it will be taken from them.

Im nova 2 right now and Im still playing it everyday. You can play this game to hang around casual ( arms race-deathmatch) , Or try hard with going ranked.

4083,"What can I say... Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is one of the better first person shooters, not because it has the better visuals or because the game has a more upstanding community but because the gameplay in this particular game was bred for competitive play. Counter-Strike has been achieveing this level competitive play since the begining and hasn't stopped since.

If you are looking to pickup Counter-Strike: Global Offensive here are some reasons to persuade you to pick up CS:GO over it's competitors.

1. CS:GO is not about running and gunning - In CS:GO accuracy is everything and timing your shots could be the difference between life and death, where in games like Call of Duty and Battlefield where the game has a community of squeaking children who ""dropshot"" in order to get a kill, In CS:GO you will find it more likely than not if you run around and spray you will die more than you will frag, this is because of the accuracy system.

2. Unlike most other first person shooter games CS:GO requires alot of teamplay to actually achieve a victory in the competitive gamemodes. If you come into the game unprepared you will probably get yelled at by some experienced players but do not let them discourage you, you will become better and surpass even their skill level. Learn calls, smokes and any other tactical thing you can learn in this game to give yourself the edge and most of all never talk negative to your teammates as this will just provide stress and tension between your teammates and yourself.

3. Skill Groups are a big part of CS:GO, In games like battlefield and call of duty your skill group will always go up as you play the game and earn exp, but in CS:GO the ranking system is a little different, ELO is what CS:GO uses and it does a really good job of accurately matching you against an opponent of your skill level. Everytime you play a full competitve match of CS:GO whether it be a win or a loss your ELO will take a hit, so if you win your ELO ranking will increase and if you win most of your games you will end up at a higher skill group which is displayed by an ingame rank. If you lose most of your games you will most likely downrank which is fair as if you lose most of your games you probably do not belong in your skill group and got there by pure luck or beating other people that do not belong at their skill group.

4. Skins - Alot of people hated skins when they first added them as they thought the game was going through a transformation into Team Fortress 2 but they couldn't be more wrong about such an event. Skins were added to the game to be monetary gain and to show support for the game by making it so community members could create and possibly get their content implemented into the game. This allowed the general community to have a bigger impact on more things in the game. Skins come in all colors, shapes and sizes to fit the default guns in the game and add an artisitc visual to the game that is otherwise non-existant by the games map and other textures. Skins can also be traded and vary in prices so you can make money just from playing the game and also sink tons of dough into the game.

5. It's fun - This game will not always be fun as the learning curve in this game is massive and you will probably find yourself asking yourself why you are even playing this game but then you will remember that you want to learn how to be better and once you do the game will open up and become one of the better games you play as this game is has everything that other games from the same genre are missing. Keep playing and never giveup.

This is just a taste of the game and everything else their is to love in CS:GO comes naturally to those that play the game frequently, I hope you read this review fully and are intrigued if you do not already own this game.",True

Where elite counter-terrorist squads need to buy their weapons (persumably cause their goverment is a bitch)...
Play realistic scenarios where Terrorist dont carry more than one bomb, to blow up a bunch of boxes, and CT's
only need to save one hostage...fuck the rest.
Play on a large variaty of maps (de_dust2,de_nuke,de_inferno), and use realistic weaponry that has camos whitch can fit in a amusment park enviroment.

I'm counterstrike boy starting from v 1.3. 
Big fan of CS all the way, it's my favourite game. 
When CS:GO showed up, i was really sceptic about that game, that's why i didn't bought it in 2012.

CS:GO is one of the best FPS games you can find right now on the market. It's really balanced, from every pistol, shotgun, smg.
You can kill with anything, weapon is not so much important, as in 1.6, where mostly you heard sounds of AK, Deagle, or AWP.

As for me,even if i played more then 2000 hrs of CS 1.6 it was really complicated in my first matches, since textures and graphics changed a ""bit"". 
But it's not really that hard to get used to engine, graphics.
I really like the competitive system, since i remember that pain in ass called ""mIRC"" :D

4176,"Hello again,

If you like Counter-Strike: Source, this is more of the same only much improved. There are added modes of play, but beware when starting out that you should check the key bindings right off because, for example, the buy key is by default the use key. There are other differences, but if you haven't played this series yet, I would advise to get any one of the franchise on sale before ever spending full price on this game. One of the issues is that there are random errors that pop up which Valve/Steam apparently can't fix and which will get you banned in competitive play due to no fault of your own. I've had issues with pure server errors, and I'm hoping I've resolved them. Only time will tell. It kind of sucks that Valve allows an issue to continue in competitive game play where money could ultimately be at stake and which could cause teams to lose, which places abandons in your profile, and which will get you banned ultimately and prevent you from using the license you've paid for. My advice if you can't get Steam to resolve issues with their games is to contact the Better Business Bureau first. Sometimes just the threat of doing so will get a response from customer support.  Good luck if you buy this.",True

The strong point is that VALVe publishes updates regularly but also brings a support for the eSport with ""eSport cases"", team sticker or event cashprize (ESL One, DreamHack). 

VALVe is also close to the community and also helps map maker with the Operation/Season Pass like Operation Breakout or Operation Phoenix, so you can play community map in competitive mode !

The weak point imo, is the community, you're a noob, ou you're a cheater. Furthermore, there are many cheater when the game is cheap on Steam, but these low prices are usually followed by many VAC ban...

This game does not look like other games as the Call of Duty Saga (this game is for child and noob) and they want to make money, CS:GO is a real competitive game which knows how to evolve and which knows how to listen to his community pro and casual community !

4236,"Counter Strike: Global Offensive is unlike any other FPS in it's genre with it's old school CS1.6-ish gun mechanics and similar maps from it's predecessor games. You play the role of a terrorist, whose job is to get to a bomb site, plant the bomb there and wait for it to detonate or kill every Counter-Terrorist preventing you from planting that bomb site. On the other hand, you play as a Counter-Terrorist whose job is to prevent the bomb from being planted at any of the bomb sites either by elimination of the aforementioned terrorists or by defusal of the bomb. The game may be viewed as one that has gun mechanics of its own, completely unique from what one may be used to in most FPS games and that it takes a little getting used to the whole game before one can start getting kills. That, and it's all about reaction times, camping the right spots, watching out for your buddies and what not. One minute you're winning and the next thing you know, your buddies have been killed by a flanking SMG bearer. In addition, the game's competitive mode and its integration with the skill system is what makes it and breaks it. The skill system determines your skill and puts you up against players of the same skill level so to ensure a fun user experience however, this very feature is what sometimes breaks it. How? People who buy dual accounts just to play with new players. That's how.

4257,"Counter-Strike is one of the biggest names in the PC gaming community, and for good reason: it revolutionized multiplayer FPS games. After the original CS hit shelves, along with 1.6 and Source, Counter-Strike: Global Offensive has set the bar even higher, and jumped over it tenfold.

Sticking close to it's roots, Global Offensive employs it's famous bomb defusal and hostage mission game modes (available in both ""casual"" and ranked 5v5 ""competetive"" types), along with integrating some other fun modes, such as arms race and deathmatch. Bomb and hostage scenarios are lead by a buying system, encouraging successful kills and objectives (like planting the bomb) to aid in buying gear in the next round. Players are required to use teamwork and tactics in order to come out on top against the enemy team, and winning a game gives a sense of satisfaction unlike any other first-person shooter game I've ever experienced.

If you are expecting this game to be anything like Call of Duty or Battlefield, you will be sorely disappointed. Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is an excellent addition to the CS saga, and I strongly recommend picking it up and giving it a try.",True

Pros:

Yet another Counter-Strike game which delivers in every aspect of competitive and fun gameplay. The transition between one CS game to this one may be difficult for some because it does differ. But, If you're a CS Veteran and fan like me, you owe it to yourself to buy this game.

If you're familiar with the CS games, then you probably already know that CS is a blast to play with friends. CS games take skill and practice, and therefor it's really fun and exciting to improve your skill and display it online in the competitve scene. There is no other FPS that matches the satisfaction of managing to pull off a 1v5 clutch, or get an ace in the compititive game mode. And this is where the game shines, and will keep me coming back for more.

Like recent CS games, this is also a FPS game with a long lifespan and great replayability. Global Offensive gives us a big graphical improvement compared to the older CS games and adds a few new features into the mix. Popular custom community game modes from the recent CS games, like Gun Game and Deathmatch, have been implemented popular in CS:GO as official game modes which I think is a great addition. They've added a few new weapons and gadgets, a bunch of different and interesting tweaks on the original CS maps and they've also added an official Competitive game mode too. Here you get assigned a rank based on your skill and performances. Competitive mode is where this game truly stands out from other CS games, but, here, is where most of the cons of the game lay.

Cons:

Firstly, Competitve and other official game mode servers are strictly locked to 64 tick servers. This will be something that many will find very hard to get used to, and personally, I think it's down right crap. Since every other CS game has 128 tick servers, I don't understand valves dicision here. Do they want to earn more money? Do they care? Either way this is a problem that Valve has to address, especially for all the competitive players who really notice the difference.

Secondly, the VAC system. Now this my freinds, is the real issue with this game. And in the perfect world this wouldn't have to be an issue, but as we know, there's always that kid who doesn't give a shit and decides to turn on some of his hacks/cheats, like the infamous wall hack, aim bot or trigger bot. 

Now, one should not have to want to play the game but at the same time not want to becuase there's a 50 50 procent chance to end up against a hacker in competitive matchmaking. The VAC system relies on player reports and people reviewing other peoples gameplay. Sounds good right? Well, no, the system bans in waves instead of on the spot, some people can go weeks with hacks without getting banned.


All in all, this is a great game, and I would possibly give it a higher rating if they manage to address some of these issues. But I definately would recommend this game to newcomers out there and the veterans.",True

4301,"Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is the pinnacle in online competitive gaming.

CS:GO is a 5-on-5 competitive first-person shooter with multiple official and many community-made gamemodes, the most commonly played one being DE, also known as the Bomb Defusal mode. This is the competitive gamemode of CS:GO, and also where the game really shines. We will be focusing on the Bomb Defusal mode in this review.

In CS:GO, the rules are simple. Terrorists have to either plant a bomb in one of the two sites, or take out the whole Counter-Terrorist team to win the round, while the Counter-Terrorists have to either defuse the bomb, or take out the Terrorist team.

The tight angles and narrow, near-claustrophobic indoor areas make the game very intense and fast-paced, while some maps still offer the wide, big areas for snipers to take advantage of. The atmosphere of the maps are stunning as always expected from Valve games. While the overall graphical quality is not nearly as good as the most recent shooters of our time, it still stands out to this day mostly due to it's amazing map themes and detailed modelwork.

This game is not for the lone wolf FPS gamer, teamwork is heavily required throughout a match from simple boosts to extremely-planned bombsite retakes. You will find yourself talking to your teammates a lot and giving them info on where the enemies are. Of course, this doesn't mean individual skill isn't nearly as important as teamplay. It's not as easy as it is to shoot the enemy than to see them.

The weapons control similar to the classic pattern scheme every Counter-Strike game has had since the first game. All weapons have recoil that consists of a simple pattern that goes upwards until a certain point, and the added factor of movement and being shot really makes this game's weapons an easy to use, difficult to master beast. Almost every weapon is equally balanced, and it is quite possible to win a fight against a sniper rifle with an M4A4 on a long range.
While the weapons on CS:GO do not follow realistic examples of recoil and damage, the fire rate is close to the real counterparts of the weapons.

The health system is the classic 100HP from most Source games, but with the added factor of armor. While wearing a Kevlar Vest significantly lowers damage on the upper body, the higher-price Kevlar + Helmet saves you from a headshot or two whilist in combat against an enemy player.

The game uses a money-based economy as a way to obtain weapons and gear. Every team gains money upon killing a player, winning a round, losing a round, planting the bomb etc.
The players cannot share money between eachother, thus making the communication aspect shine once more with players dropping eachother weapons to get an equal footing with the enemy's economy. The Terrorists use stronger but more unstable weapons that require tap-firing and good aim, while the Counter-Terrorists side has more spray-based weapons with low damage but very stable spray patterns that make it easier to rain hell on an oncoming enemy as they approach.

The game is extremely fun when played with a full team or with friends who know eachother well. However, the same fun factor isn't really there when playing the game on Competitive Matchmaking. The players are way more serious here as expected from a Competitive shooter, but some players can be really toxic, engage in verbal abuse, or be very unhelpful to the team in general with insults shooting off all over the place, creating unneccesary inner war between team members. This is a huge drawback for what the game offers, as teamwork is a big part of the game, and when you miss out on it, chaos ensues.

For the more casual players seeking alone fun out of this game, there are gamemodes such as Deathmatch, Surf, Aim and Bunnyhop that you can find in the Community Server Browser hosted by other players to enjoy. However, since the last few updates, Valve seems to be attempting to depracate this feature and make everyone focus on the official gamemodes as much as they can.

The SDK for the game is not very good, and very outdated. We're looking forward to what Source 2 will bring as a way of editing maps and content stored in the game. However, the much popular in-game currency of the game, skins, have much more settings to fiddle around with.

Skins are a huge addition to the game included with the Arms Deal update a few years back. They range from cheap to expensive, depending on quality. The worst being Battle-Scarred, and the best being Factory New. The conditions of the weapons make them differ heavily in price and aesthethics. Some prefer Battle-Scarred, while some prefer Factory New.
The Price of these weapons range from a low low price of 3 cents, going up to a whopping 5 thousand US dollars, depending on what you're looking for. Knives are especially the more rare and expensive skins within the game. Skins are obtained through either the Community Market or by opening Cases. Cases are usually very cheap but require a key you pay for to open. Upon opening a Case you have a chance of dropping a very expensive weapon or a knife, to a very cheap, nearly useless weapon several times cheaper than the key itself. However these skins are only cosmetic and do not change the stats of a weapon, so you do not need them to gain an advantage over another player.

I rate this game a Flaming Russian Vocabulary/10. There are definitely flaws in the community, but the gameplay is super, and the competitive scene is filled with new teams. :D",True
4302,"Counter Strike: Global Offensive, a victim of its popularity. Just like its map, Dust 2.

What can I say? It's filled with hackers, smurfs, griefers, annoying kids, and salty players. Valve sees the game as a business and runs it like one. They don't tend to listen (despite fanboys saying otherwise) to the players and put out cosmetics when they can be improving the state of the game. Counter Strike: Global Offensive definitely has the potential to be one of the greatest games out there, with very high replayability. However, its community is what draws the game back.

Counter Strike contains tons of fan-made content which ranges from maps to weapon-cosmetics. Almost everything in Counter Strike: Global Offensive has been built off of its players. Now, its infested with a plethora of toxicity. Yes, you may occasionally find a few gems in the playerbase, but it's getting harder each day.

In reality, it's all about perspective. You can see this game as a tool to create a career (esports) out of, and to compete with other teams with programs such as FaceIt or CEVO. You can also see it as a fun and casual game you play with your mates, laughing at the hackers/salty kids/whatever. Maybe even join in with the fun and be a hacker or griefer yourself! 

Counter Strike: Global Offensive is a great game with tons of content both within the game and in the workshop. Really fun, especially with friends, and can be a way of casually competing. What I stress about though is Valve's business practices and the fanbase. But who am I to see how Valve should operate? After all, they've made millions off of this game and their gaming platform, Steam, has risen  to the TOP of the charts. 

TL;DR - Great game with tons of content. High replayability value and much funner with friends. Toxic community and greedy Valve is ruining it slowly, though. It will be the funnest game you've played, but you'll still hate it.",True

4304,"At first glance, I thought it was an ez game. Boy I was wrong. You will learn alot with the spray pattern, movements, communications, boost spots, and rotation once you play it.
|The general part|

Pros:
-You will meet alot of people that are friendly especially women who respects you equally.
-Possibility you might find ur potential lover. Since this game has slowly become dating site like wtf.
-You will be smart with your game sense, if you are dedicated to your time on csgo for reaching your goal as a esport player.
-You can make kick ass youtube video or anytype of career outta this game.

Cons: 
-Very addictive, can impede your goals in life, especially in your education life such as your highschool or college year.
-Will emotionally drain you, if you feel shitty by people who make you mad, or plainly rejects you as a person.
-Hard to get outta of silver, if you derank from Gold Nova.
-Competitive match will NOT be ez to win, since hackers, griefers, and smurfs are crawling all over the place.

Final Verdict: If you wanna play out for the fun of it and make new friends go for it. If you wanna dedicate the time being a pro player or becoming a youtuber from this game Do it.

""If you could see it, then you'd understand."" That glistening anti-koan punctuates the chorus of Coldplay's skyscraping 2005 single ""Speed of Sound"", and the lyric's profound meaninglessness has doubled as a mission statement for the mega-band's career thus far. They've established a reputation as mainstream rock's koi pond architects, designing music that's deceptively shallow but, if caught at the right moment, shimmeringly beautiful, to the point that you could focus on it for hours.

Impossibly indulgent on a sonic level while retaining the intellectual depth of a cell phone commercial, Coldplay's catalog is largely experiential—a reflecting pool for the hopes, dreams, and heartaches that listeners wish to apply to the music. This pliability has meant that Coldplay can come off as impersonal, a gaseous giant of anonymity in rock music's solar system; nearly 10 years ago, the stultifyingly dense third album X&Y threatened to swallow the band completely, as Coldplay refined the post-post-punk affectations of 2002's A Rush of Blood to the Head until they were left with an immobile monolith.

On the verge of overreaching, Coldplay doubled down with 2008's Viva La Vida or Death and All His Friends, a world-beating document of giddy experimentation and costume-rock bathos that stands as their most thrilling, impressionistic work. Mylo Xyloto followed three years later, which took its predecessor's widescreen template and enlarged it to IMAX-size, indulging in rave-y piano stabs and night-flight flourishes with the color-filled exuberance of a child that can't stop eating crayons.

Mylo Xyloto was further proof that Coldplay are at their best when they embrace their corniest impulses; their sixth album, Ghost Stories, finds them taking a sharp left turn. Preceded by the non-single ""Midnight"", a watery electro-folk Bon Iver facsimile accompanied with a video reminiscent of an iTunes visualizer, nearly everything about the arrival of Ghost Stories has seemed small: the nine-song tracklist, the spartan, deep-blue angel's-wings cover, the disappointing lack of costumes. The absence of grandiosity signaled to eager fans and sneering bystanders alike that, this time around, something might be a little off.

That something can be traced to Martin's marriage to actress and $600-hand-cream guru Gwyneth Paltrow, which quietly imploded in March of this year. More a separation than an outright divorce, recent court documents revealed that the couple are still living together, and in a 2008 SPIN profile, the only subject that the otherwise affable Martin bristled against discussing was his personal life with Paltrow. As long as the world's known him, Chris Martin has also proved impossible to truly know, so whether his recent familial troubles would seep into his band's latest was anyone's guess.

And yet, Ghost Stories is unmistakably Coldplay's ""breakup album,"" a subdued work that finds Martin and his band crisply moping through mid-tempo soundscapes and fuzzy electronic touches that have the visceral impact of a down comforter tumbling down a flight of stairs. Featuring production from longtime collaborators Daniel Green and Rik Simpson, along with behind-the-boards pro Paul Epworth, drone-techno auteur Jon Hopkins, and Kanye West collaborator Mike Dean, the record is serene and weightless to a fault. Coldplay abandon the musical tourism and extroverted strides of their last few albums and find themselves adrift.

The closest the record comes to a bona fide anthem is the moderately enjoyable ""A Sky Full of Stars"", a rocket-fueled single on the level of ""Clocks"" and ""Speed of Sound"" tainted by Swedish dance producer AVICII's cheap-sounding drum presets and boilerplate synth motifs. ""I don't care/ If you tear me apart,"" Martin wails at the peak of the song's endless chorus, a passionate exclamation that doubles one of the most nakedly personal admissions he's made on record.

Ghost Stories certainly sounds like the product of someone working out their private pain in public; unfortunately, the results are less Blood on the Tracks and more ""Can I Borrow a Feeling?"". Coldplay's catalog has plenty of examples where Martin's words have failed him, but his diaristic reflections on Ghost Stories are abnormally painful. ""Tell me you love me/ If you don't, then lie,"" he coos on the Spandau Ballet-gone-Disney ballad ""True Love""; during the plodding ""Another's Arms"", he ruminates on lost domestic bliss watching TV with a loved one, ""Your body on my body."" If the expression of carnal closeness-via-TiVo makes you cringe, imagine how he feels.

""Ink"" is the album's most indefensible moment, musically and lyrically, and the song handily snatches the title of Worst Coldplay Song from X&Y's impossibly leaden, fuckin'-magnets stinker ""What If"". ""Got a tattoo/ And the pain's alright,"" Martin cries while running through a series of love-as-permanence metaphors, over rippling guitar and burbling atmospherics ripped from Phil Collins' Tarzan soundtrack. The last time Coldplay indulged in ""rainforest rock,"" it was Viva La Vida's transcendent, gorgeous ""Strawberry Swing"", which featured Martin exclaiming beatifically, ""It's such a perfect day""; on ""Ink"", he moves from vine to vine until swinging in solitude at the track's end, exclaiming with a sigh, ""All I know is that I love you so/ So much that it hurts.""

Fittingly, ""Ink"" is one of the few tracks on Ghost Stories that leaves a mark, and that's partially due to Martin's lovely-as-ever vocals; when not chronicling his own pain, he occasionally breaks into appealing birdsong, a wordless pitter-patter that marks the chorus of the record's pleasant-enough lead single, ""Magic"". Otherwise, Ghost Stories is a collection of unmemorable songs from a band that's made enough memories to last a lifetime. Everything sounds pristine—this is a Coldplay album, and instrumentally the band is as exacting as ever—but by the dreary piano-led closer ""O"", you're left with a series of songs that are fragile, plain, and forgettable.

Conventional wisdom says X&Y is Coldplay's worst album, but amidst that record's shiftless bloat, there were real-deal highlights that hit with blunt impact and have since stood the test of time. Ghost Stories contains no such moments, and thus threatens to rob X&Y of its dubious title. Its intimate nature shares the most kinship with Coldplay's first album, 2000's peerless Parachutes. Twelve years later, that album sounds like the work of a different band, and that's because it is; Coldplay have become one of the biggest acts in the world since their comparatively modest debut, and as a result Ghost Stories' attempts to return to close-mic'd intimacy come across as out-of-touch as Lucille Bluth asking how much a banana costs.

The callback to Parachutes' hushed whispers also means that Ghost Stories is the first time Coldplay has sounded explicitly self-referential. They're a band that's withstood enough comparisons to U2 over the years, and the warmed-over leftovers that have marked Bono and Co.'s last decade as a creative entity are enough to suggest that, if Coldplay continue to head down the path of addressing their own legacy, their best moments are truly behind them.

4371,"CS:GO - a game that will make you win-greedy.

CS:GO used to be a great game, always had fun playing mostly comptetitively.
It's a game for people that are looking to become really good into a game and like slow-paced gameplay.
Don't expect that being good in Overwatch will automatically make you good in CS:GO, since the gameplay is very different.
CS:GO, also standing for Counter Strike: Global Offensive has a long story of rise and (somewhat) fall. You will have a hard time getting out of the no-rank zone, where you must play with people that are first-timers, like you, or people that have 1000+ hours just warming-up.
Do not expect this to be a friendly game for people to relax. Competitive gameplay is just the kind of fun people have. And yes, you heard me right. People that play this game have more than a 1000 hours on it. I know people that have more than 3000 (some of which make a living off of this game). And this game does have lootboxes but worry not, they are just cosmetics that do not affect the gameplay in any way.
Some people also make a living off of trading. Which is also very advanced.
----------------------------------------------
How the game works and what you're expected to do:
If you're a newbie (noob), you might stay away from the competitive matches and learn how to:
~Strafe,
~Peek,
~Flank,
~Positions,
~Grenade shortcuts,
~Maps,
~Team build,
~Recoil patterns of various weapons,
~Crosshair placement,
~Team placement and 
~How different weapons behave and when to use which.

This might seem like a lot, but most of them are things that take about 10 minutes to learn, but of course, you have to practice them. And don't worry, you can play this game as a hobby.
Most of these stuff can be learned through YouTube videos, chats, coaches/friends, the community on Reddit, Steam and verious different websites or etc.

When you think that you are ready for competitive gaming, you will realise that most of the people you're playing with are kids or people that don't talk your language and have completely no knowledge of the game.
Most of the time you shouldn't worry, because you can also find good teams on special website to build teams.

After winning 10 matches, give yourself a pat on the back. You have reached your first rank! 
Silver 1.
Now, one thing that you should worry about in competitive matches are smurfs or hackers. This is why you should almost never play solo if you want to win.
Smurfs are people that have a higher rank, silver 5 for example, but play on a second account or intentionally lose to rank down so they can play vs. lower-skilled players.

Also, after getting through, let's say Silver 2, and you're now Silver 3, it's time for you to start warming up!
You can warm-up by playing stuff like Deatchmaches, or casual (the place where you started) or download maps from the workshop page. The workshop page is a place full of nicely put togheter maps for different purposes.
There are maps for learning how to Strafe, throw grenades or anything from above!
And of course maps for warming-up!

Community servers:

CS:GO is not jsut a standard shooting game, you can also do things such as surf, bhop or play various different mods, that can be found on the community servers.

I really hope that this review helped you decide if you want to play this game or not.

4384,"TOP 5 REASONS WHY WE LOVE & HATE CS:GO GLOBAL OFFENSIVE!

There are tons of online/video games out there and I bought a new gaming desktop 4 months ago, was wondering what kind of games should I invest my time into. And 3 months ago, I was introduced to this game “CS:GO Global Offensive” by a close friend of mine. At first, I wasn’t sure if I was willing to spend S$ 15 to play this game because I was never good at shooting games and I get frustrated easily if I don’t play well. And a lot of my friends are playing this game so I thought I could give it a try. After 3 months of playing this game, I have concluded on why people are addicted to this game and why is it so popular. Below are my 5 reasons on why we love and hate this game. 

-	Opening of Cases

When we ranked up in the game, it sometimes drops either great cases that we’ve been wanting or shitty cases that we wonder, “why is Gaben doing this to us” by dropping the same old cases. Whatever the cases that we ended up getting, we will always give in to the temptations and spend some cash in opening them. The sense of the unknown and hope often give us the rush of adrenaline, praying to all the Gods that we could think of and hoped that the line stopped at the items we want. If we got the items that we don’t want, we would curse and swear at ourselves for wasting time and money(again), also losing all hope and faith that Gaben is playing with us. And if we are lucky enough to get the items that we’ve always wanted or rare items, we would jump up and down from our seats or even running around the house as if we’ve won a lottery. Trust me, our parents will look at us like we are idiots. 

-	Condition and Skins of the weapon

Whenever we open cases we will always look at the condition of the weapon because no one wants a Battle-scarred weapon right?  Firstly, it doesn’t look new and “shiny”, secondly, it doesn’t have a high value on it even if you try to sell it (but depends on the skin though). Someway or another when we use an AK-47 even if it’s well-worn, we just don’t feel right. It’s as if we don’t get good kills like headshots JUST because of its condition, we know too well that it’s all in the mind. (You know what I am talking about.)
Weapon skins is also a very important factor in this game because if we get a very rare skin with the condition of battle-scarred, we can still sell it off with high value in the market. For example, Dragon lore AWP (Battle-scarred) can sell up to S$ 820 on Steam market! Besides this can be the only reason we can explain to our parents, that playing CS:GO for long hours is because we are earning money, right? 

-	Sense of Achievement 

Playing this game can be very frustrating most of the time, especially when we first started out. We were so bad and noob that we kept dying, being the bottom player in the team is not a pleasant thing. We all can relate to this all too well. However, being the bottom player is not the end of the world, this just means that we have to keep improving ourselves and play better. After hours and hours of investing in this game, we are bound to play better and when we realized that we played better than yesterday, that sweet sense of achievement is so satisfying. Of course, play and learn, in other words, invest your time wisely in this game.

-	Teammates

All of us know that this game needs 5 players to form a team in order to play a competitive game. It is very difficult to find teammates who can play like a team and whenever we find good teammates with great playing skills, we thank God or Gaben for the luck we had. But, there are days when we get matched up with teammates who are snobbish, arrogant or leaders wanna-be, it will be a game that’s full of stress and we will get pretty bad at the rest of the game. Let’s treat each other kindly, don’t be such a smart ass or jerk in the team.

-	The Community 

Putting aside all the game aspects, I dare say that the community is “The Heart” of CS:GO. You will never know when you will match with teammates who are jerks that are full of themselves and keep calling you noob, just because they have more kills than you. Or match up with nicest teammates who know that you are still learning, also willing to be patient with you and teach you along the way (VERY HARD to come by). It’s the community that make this game more addicting, because we never know when is a good or a bad match. If matching up teammates either spoiling or cheers you, then I have to break it down to you, “My friend, you are addicted to CS:GO.” 

If you are willing to take the risk of having blood pressure most of the time then maybe you can give this game a try. Welcome to CS:GO Global Offensive, Have fun and Good luck!

4392,"Over 2018 the game has improved tremendously, Updates included (1) Panorama, a new HTML5-based UI engine, (2) Trust Factor, a system that matches each player with other players with similar levels of trust worthiness determined by account age, frequency of reports and other in-game and out-of-game factors, (3) VACnet, a machine learning anti-cheating system that scans demos server-side and learns from Overwatch, and (4) Danger Zone, a unique fast-paced Battle Royale experience with CS:GO's gun mechanics and style.

Not to mention numerous new maps and map updates, gun meta changes, and changes to the way the major cycle operates.

Out of all of these Trust Factor was the thing that improved my experience in this game the most, frequency of toxic teammates dropped way down, cheaters are near non-existent (never encountered anyone who was undoubtedly cheating in my trust level) and the overall experience is a lot more authentic to what CS is supposed to be.

Overall this game turned from great to fantastic, and all the recent complaining about the game going free to play is pointless and a waste of everyone's time.",True

Pros - Lots of fun, weapon customisation, lots of cooooool map designs, meet lots of great people, have good talks/laughs.

Cons - Lots of twelvies who play casual who think it is a fun idea to spam the mic with their squeaky voices just so they can be like 'Oh Em Gee! are you a girl!?' or 'Oh Em Gee it's a girl!!' or 'it's ok, she's just a *girl*' or 'show me your...!' or '*insert name here* is a slu.../who...'(like seriously?

Well that's because I know that this game is not for everyone.
-It takes lots and lots of practice to land shots, let alone a headshot.
-Every weapon needs to be studied; the recoil, the range, the spray, etc.
-Good gameplay requires a decent large mousepad (according to youtube tutorials).

2000 hours now, and I'm still bad at schüt bideo gaem

[b]old review: 2016-11-23[/b]
After almost 1,200 hours of Counterstrike, I feel like this game deserves an updated review.
Just a few weeks ago, I wouldn't even touch the game anymore, mostly because of the toxic fanbase.
Two days ago, I started playing with my friends once again.
And guess what, it's still a lot of fun.
The constant updates by Valve are what keep this game alive for all these years.
You can complain about gamebreaking updates and ingame skins as much as you want, the core gameplay is still great, and bugs get squished comparably fast.

4450,"I mostly love this game because of the new COMPETITIVE mode. If you want to know more about it, read the first paragraph. If you want to know about every other game modes, read the whole review :).

With the Competitive game mode, Counter Strike became one of the most interesting, intensive and thrilling FPS game. Competitive game mode is about to play 5v5 matches with your team where you need tactics, skills and knowledge of the game, maps and spots. There are a maximum of 30 rounds / competitive game. The team that wins 16 rounds will Win the whole match. If your team wins, members of the team climb up on a virtual ladder. Winning more and more matches may get you better ranks by the time and with ranks of course, harder enemies in the future matches. When you are playing Competitive mode, every step, move and shot matters. A fault can easily loose you a round out of the 30 or a better shot or lucky move can get a win for you and your team. Even it makes pressure on you to prove your skills, you have to stay calm to be able to do your best! Play it with friends, make a clan, and create one of the best team or just solo queue for the matches you will enjoy the game (except when you get bad team mates with zero tactics). 

The second new game mode is Arms Race. Still you can select what team you are in, but it isn't really matter. There are Arms Race specialized maps (unfortunately only a few) where you start with an SMG and every kill brings you a new weapon. You have to be the fastest to fight yourself through every weapon and get a kill with every one of them. The last one is a knife (golden knife in this game mode). If you manage to get the kill with the knife before anyone else you win the match.
This game mode is fast-paced and excellent for some fun, and stress beating.

The 3rd one is the Demolition mode. You can play the classic game on smaller maps with only one bomb site combined with the element of Arms Race what means every round you get frag makes you jump on the next weapon in the next round.

Ofc there is the old game mode, called CASUAL where you play the classic maps with huge teams and there is a DM where you can select what weapon you want to play and then go and kill the enemy team members until the time goes down and the round ends.

I recommend this game for every FPS player. You can play DM or Arms Race if you want some brainless shooting, Casual or Demolition for short time playing/casual play ofc, or Competitive if you have more time to play and not scared for some team work, thinking and ranking ;).

4459,"So, after playing this game now for 2 weeks i want to share my expiriences with all of you. 

Pros: 

- The amouth of fun you can have with this game is insane. People started playing the actual mod for halflife 14 years ago and keep playing the game series.

- This game will be played for YEARS. Its not like other shooters develpoing new parts of the shooter every year. It has a fanbase that still is insanely growing and doesnt seem to stop.

-Should work on any Computer, because it uses the source engine that doesnt really need a super-expensive-awsume-hd graphics card. a normal one should do it.

-Interesting gameplay

-If you quiet have the skill you can make your own maps ( and release them to the workshop, that also goes for weapon skins. )

-Make Steamwallet-money by drops found ingame by selling them on the community market. These drops are mostly crates and skins, the skins can be used for weapons. They just make the weapon look different. That doesnt change it in any stats  like +3 damage. 

-It has a nice community ( No screaming CoD-kids c: )

--------
Pro-con:

-They game is cheap. Especially on the sales it goes for under 7€. But that also means Hackers can easily get a new copy of the game if their old account is banned.
--------

Con: 

- This game is something COMPLETELY else than games like Battlefield or CoD. in the defuse mode without respawn you dont rush in a little room with your MOAB and kill everyone for a hyperkillstreak to get a dog. You have to carefully sneak up to the enemy and watch out for footsteps of others. Not to say thats a bad thing, but you really have to get used to that.

- For newcomers ( like me ) its quiet difficult to get started. There are many players that already play since the mod was released 2000 and they got a really big load of knowledge that you probably dont. But with the time you get used to the basics of the game and then you can have fun.",True

The infamous cannon, the slug-mug-tug, and few others. If  you are lucky, there are crate drops that occur once a month and you can buy a key from the In-Game store with 5,000 microsoft points.

Let's just say they won't be bugging me anymore. But now I dont have the funds to maintain an internet connection. I've sold everything I have just to play. I can't even go to starbucks and use their wifi because I sold my clothes and apparently they dont accept nudity. So basically I'm writing this review from my phone on top of a bridge.

4522,"CSGO is a near-perfect multiplayer shooter. Unlike the previous versions, which were often difficult to get in to, this one offers a variety of modes that will appeal to all skill levels. It has a large community and a well supported workshop, ensuring that this discount-priced game will be around for years to come.

In short, you either play as the good or bad guys and must either kill the other team or complete objectives to win the round, which will earn you more money to do the same thing again but faster. It's been around for years and has spawned many imitators.

The game isn't much of a looker as it is based on the same engine as the original Half Life 2 was. However, Valve have polished it as much as they can and the community consists of lots of awesome mappers who have been churning out brilliantly imaginative and beautiful maps almost on a daily basis.

Is it worth getting if you already own Counter Strike: Source? Yes. CSS was always Counter Strike shoe-horned into the Source engine. CSGO feels far more like a standalone game. Valve have very carefully listened to what people have wanted and have made a very appealing game. The best feature must be the competitive play. You cannot leave these matches or you'll suffer a temporary ban from the feature. After 10 wins in this mode you'll be ranked and will be paired up with people of the same skill, meaning that the game is challenging but fair regardless of your skill level. These matches are exciting, occasionally scary or frustrating, but are the most rewarding part of the game and improving your rank is one of the most satisfying experiences in any video game, ever.

There are all kinds of teams and communities that you can join. Really, if I was stuck on a desert island with one game this would most likely be my top choice. It's bigger than you can hope to conquer and has a huge community around it which will likely be around for years to come, something that can't be said for the Call of Duty franchise which is probably its closest rival. Remember that those games are full price and have another one churned out each year, fragmenting the community. Plus you can customise your weapon skins in CSGO. Surely that's the most important feature?! All they need to add now are hats and you might as well live in CSGO.",True

4524,"I won't lie to ya, it's a brilliant fucking game. But ranking up is literally impossible when your start rank is silver, trust me. I've been playing this game for more than 2 years now and in all that time I've never managed to get out of silver, not because I'm necessarely bad I mean I've nearly got 1k hours so I've refined my skills but because you will always get teamed with brain dead teammates who will ultimately throw the game for you, or on the other hand you can have an acceptable team but play against very shady players (I.e smurfs or hackers). It's an amazing competitive fps, but a good chunk of the community is absolutely terrible (I'm looking at you russian silvers) and if you're an english speaking person and you live in europe you will almost always play with people that either speak russian or turkish so don't expect good communication with your teammates (hence why you'll often lose a game because of bad communication). 

This wasn't a very constructive review but more or less my experience with the game and what I dislike about the matchmaking system.

Hi everyone, Welcome back to another installment of Valve Software Review! I'm your host, the Flynn of the week. 
Well hello everyone, today we will be reviewing Counting-Strikes 3, locally known as ""Count-The-Strike-Global-Domination"". Before we dive in, we need to learn a little about the earlier installments! 

Back in 1999 we had a little game called Count-This, your classic shootem up mayhem blaster game. In Counter-Stride it felt like you were floating on ice, shooting water from a pool noodle, all while taking in the 3 polygon atmosphere of the original 2 maps! (dust 1 and dust 2) This is what made counter-man so unique in its gameplay, make the player nauseous constantly, and it excelled at this immensely! 

Winning gamer of the year, the old lard you've come to know and love, Grab newell, wanted more money! In comes Counter-Strike Source(material)! A lot of time, Effort, and of course big pink cookies, went into this installment! You could now shoot your f***** gun and it would actually shoot this time! Outstanding! Counter-Strike Scourge broke new grounds in shooting gameplay such as:
Controlable guns
No more ice on your feet
3 more polygons(total of 6)
But this wasn't enough for the old man, he recognized there should be more to a shooter...

In comes Cooter-Strike 3!!! You play world renowned country singer John-Shootman! Featuring many innovations, improved gun mechanics, HD graphics, realistic recoil, this game had it all! Not only did it have all these wonderful additions, but for the first time Counter-Strap was now Team Fortress 2! Weapon skins! Stickers! Mechanics from old games(p*rnsprays) now behind a paywall! Did i forget to mention $500 biker gloves? But that STILL wasn't enough for that old geezer! Fortnite gamemode, 5 year coin for buying the game! Don't forget Free-to-Play! Unfortunately Gab newsell in his time of darkness, sold out to the chinese, adding in Chinese Bootlegs(Sexon Zombi) and censored graphics. No longer could you kill your opponents, only arrest them. Sad! Counter-Strike continues to live on with every piece of garbage they throw at it, after 7 years this game is still played and loved by many. Even virgins. 

All in all, the C*nt-Striker series has been a up and down rollercoaster, filled with laughs, giggles, and gaggles. Game of the year 2(not 3) years in a row, Counte-Strike stands the test of time, because they keep updating it with microtransactions. Gabe newell would be proud.

Its easy to learn and when you do it you will see how fun it is, although i think they should fix matchmaking, so people who actually like the game, dont get matched with quitters, laggers, trolls, or just in general bad players aka noobs. Also some of the servers are a bit laggy but its all good. By the time im done with this game i would have racked up 1000+ hours ( first game to do that)

4563,I'm posting this review for level XP. This game aite.,True
4564,"During the CS:GO Beta I would have told you this game was an amazing addition to the CS lineup.. The game was designed to handle 128tic, and the official servers were hosted as such.

After full release the game was still great, and they added competitive matchmaking with a ranking system. This was the only gamemode I played for a long time.

Over time, the official server hosting seemed to be contracted out to a third party, who clearly saw cutting corners instead of buying more or better hardware / bandwidth as a pheasable option. The servers went from 128 to 64tic (this means how many updates per second between client/server, basically time resolution for movement/gunshots)..

In CS:S everyone was used to writing an autoexec to ensure their cl_interp_ratio was 1, and their cl_interp was 0. This is to ensure you are synced to the server. The command cl_interp_ratio is a ratio or devider for how many ""tic"" or ""updates"" per second your client will transmit and recieve. Valve decided in an update about 1.5-2 years ago that they would make the default cl_interp_ratio 2. Add that to the 64tic servers and everyone is now at a 31ms delay vs the 7.5ms delay the game started on.

Everyone can still have a 15ms delay vs their default 31ms, but 99% of players now do not know how to change this... so even if you change your own, it doesn't do a thing unless other players are set correct as well.

Now... The next thing, I don't even really want to talk about. Skins? At least it wasn't hats I guess. I don't use them, I think most of them look like MS paint given to children.. and it's more than sad people will pay the money they do for some. Free steam games for the people who could care less I guess.

I only recommend this game to someone who enjoys all the things I apparently despise, or if you can ignore them and just see the game behind the bullshit. There's also always the option of not playing on the 'official' servers, and there's lots of 128tic pubs. Not sure about scrim servers, but it's very very simple to set one up yourself with SteamCMD.",True

Well first time i purchased this game on 25 Nov 2015 and for a FPS impressed me for the first time.
The first game i tried from franchise was Counter-Strike 1.6 which was a magical shooter at his time.
Here the Global Offensive is very different compared with 1.6 source and condition zero.

Ratings:
Market ideea (S/B Skins and huge prices): 9.8/10 (Smartest ideea ever in a game not pay to win)
Gameplay: 7/10

Comunity: 3/10 (Rusky idiots everywhere)
Competitive game: 9/10
Safe: 8/10 (VAC Secure)

4610,"Nach 1,2K Std. In diesem Spiel muss ich mal meinen Senf dazugeben.
Wenn man dieses Spiel beginnt zu spielen wird man oft die P90 oder die AUG benutzen, desto länger man es spielt desto mehr findet man gefallen an der AK, M4A(und/oder 1).
Ich bin jetzt schon Master Guardian Elite und muss auch dazu sagen das es sich einfach gut anfühlt wenn man einen neuen besseren Rang erreicht hat.
In CS:GO erkennt man auch seine Fortschritte ziemlich gut, man steigert sich einfach jede Woche.
Man verbessert sein AIM, seine Reaktionszeit und und und.
Leider gibt es auch Leute die sich das Spiel auf einen 2ten Account kaufen nur um andere mit niedrigerem Rang zu besiegen, die sogenannten ""Smurfer"" die können einem das Spiel wirklich versauen.
Im Winter/Summer Sale kommen viele Hacker, aber zum Glück gibt es ja das ""Overwatchsystem"" im Overwatch werden die Reporteten Hacker von der Community angesehen und am Ende wird entschieden ob sie gehackt haben oder nicht dieses System schaltet man ab den Rang Gold Nova und min. 50 gewonnenen Wettkampf spielen frei.
Durch die Workshop Maps kommen noch ein vielfaches an verschiedenen Spielmodis hinzu z.B.: Surf, Deathrun etc.
Falls man noch 3€ auf seinen Steam Account hat, kann man diese in einen Schlüssel (2,50€) geben und eine von über 15 Arten der Kisten öffnen und beten das man etwas gutes bekommt.
Mein Fazit ist, wenn man keine Lust mehr auf ein CoD oder BF hat sollte man sich für 15€ dieses Spiel holen, wird am Anfang eher nicht so Spaß machen dafür aber später ;), es sorgt außerdem für eine sehr, sehr lange Zeit für Beschäftigung.",True

It's very cheap aswell and you can even make money with the game itself from the drops that you get after a game. It's not much but the game is very big and also has it's own community servers, has ongoing support from the creators and gets updated around every month with new skins for guns.

4653,"So after playing Counter Strike for about 1 year now and putting over 1000 hours into it, I thought I would make a little review. Throughout the time i've played I've seen many Good/Bad changes made to the game. I still think some of the changes are a little stupid but I've come to get used to it. Although there are a lot of cheaters I still manage to have fun. Whenever I encounter a cheater I just laugh and mess around with them, because it's funny to think people would waste 15$ on re-buying the game for multiple accounts to cheat on. I was recently reading a reddit post by a proffesional CS:GO player by the name of DaZeD in where he mentions a way that can reduce cheaters by a mass amount of numbers. He basically stated that CS:GO should add a system so that the first 50 queues are unranked so the cheaters would basically be going against other cheaters. He also said that after you finish the first 50 queues you can start playing for ranks and start playing on 128 tic servers. I agree with all of what he said. This was originally going to be a small review and it turned into a little over a paragraph. If you actually read all of this and have any opinions leave a comment letting me know, and I'll try to get back to you.",True

4658,"Folks, I'm a man of simple pleasures. I like the PP-Bizon. I like going zoom-zoom. I could write an entire review about this instrument of death but, let's get back to the game. 

CS:GO is missing something that it had when I started playing that I always enjoyed. It breaks my heart. I also pity you if you don't know what I'm about to complain about but, ignorance on this issue is pure bliss. 

I myself miss this change more than any particular map. I miss it more than any-particular buff/de-nerf. I miss it more than a previous competitive rank on a de-rank. Yeah, I went there. 

It's also admittedly something I hope for more often than I wish for Valve to fix its MP servers or crackdown on cheaters because apparently that's too much to ask. 

So instead, I'm just going to directly ask Valve in this review. 

They obviously read player reviews considering how much folks love them, right? Right. That's what they're doing instead of improving this game (right, Valve?). 

Valve. My request is a simple one. And I know I'm not alone. You can take my money but you took something from me that belonged to me and only me. I want it back.

There are 5 modes in this game: Demolition, Arms Race, Competitive, Casual and Deathmatch. New maps are added in the game or...you can choose to download extra new maps from the Counter Strike Global Offensive Workshop for more fun!!

Well i do enjoy this kind of games, so i guess i've already blown off quite a bit of money on it already, and more is to be dropped into Gabe's wallet. If you play in Europe, there is a big chance that you will be queued up with russians. they tend to only speak russian to you, and nothing else which is kind of annoying.

I do find the game itself quite entertaining and frustrating at the same time, but i do reccomend it if you are into 1st person shooters where the hackers are almost non-existant.

4709,"I hate to say it but I'm hooked to this game, There are so, so, so many problems with it XD, Here is a list of Pros and Cons.

Cons:
1. At times Competitive Match Making is really trash Queuing MG2s against/with Globals and Supremes.
2. The Anti-Cheat is trashy although it works yes it does it only ever catches stupid people with the hacks on there PC at that time and not USB stick users. Overwatch also cant determine everything.
3. Although I don't mind it, but I know some people do Mind it the Toxicity in this game is really bad, With people being Racist, Sexist and Making fun of Religion at times.
4. The ranking system is so Old I like the ranks and the order and the names but please for the love of GabeN add some freaking Gauge or something to show us what our elo is.

Pros:
1. The game is a lot of fun if you play with a full team of people you know.
2. There is a lot of socializing in the game and working as a team building who you are and building towards that new rank and it has a great thrill when you rank up.
3. It is addicting and if you can get your movement and aim on point you can hit some nutty shots.
4. I love the setup of the skins and the way you can trade your way up to a knife or basically any skin in the game. 
5. It is an amazing grinding game and it has a lot of hours of great fun in it.

Overall I think they will have to improve this game It will benefit the community and Valve.

4723,"Counter Strike: Global Offensive. A big step from Source and has become big enough to actually have a title in the large industry of video games. 

I will first start off with why this game is amazing. I find that this game is the closest thing that you could get to a raw skill video game. You start of with a weapon and the only way to get better with it is to practice. It is not like Call Of Duty which basically gives you a weapon with only vertical recoil which you compensate for by pulling down. I am not saying that COD is bad I am just comparing it to give and explanation on what I mean for a raw skill game. This game includes recoil that goes horizontally which you have to compensate for by learning the spray pattern and compensating for with mouse movements. Either it is spraying or tapping which for me at least is much harder because you have to be patient and shoot accurately.

 The idea of competitive is amazing as it gives a point to all of the gun action and killing which some people seem not to justify. It changes how you would play a first person shooter by including the ability to plan enemy attacks, seek out what their economy is like or if it is a fake. All of these things involve skill and play time of the game to learn what each of these looks like. Adding to the competitive mode the ranking system is also a great idea giving players the ability to work for something and accomplish something with all of those wasted hours infront of their computer in a dark room which in great detail describes my summer vacation. It gives a sense of being the best or overpowering your friends which is always fun because everything seems to be a competition nowadays. Competitive mode is just one of the reasons many people love Global Offensive over Source because back in Source and 1.6 it always just seemed to be a casual game with much more people. I was never able to play Source or 1.6 back in that time because I was never introduced to CS but from other people who have stated their opinion this is exactly why the love Global Offensive. 

And the last more important good thing about CS:GO is the map choice (Only including Dust II, Mirage, Cache, Inferno, Overpass and Train which are the main maps. Sorry Nuke, I still love you!). You have Dust II which is everybody's favourite map because of the balance, Mirage because of the unique strategies and simplicity of the map, Cache because of the interesting layout and the many skill based movements involved in the map, Inferno because of the quick pushes you can initiate, Train because of the vast change in the map in a short time and my favourite, Overpass because of the interesting layout and the close sites. All of these maps are perfect for competitive play because they are easy to learn and are just maps that everybody knows. 

And now this games problems. I personally have never really a proper toxic player but maybe that is because my trust factor is high and the plan that Valve have created is working. What I find to be the main problem with this game is the lack of updates. I know creating a game and keeping it up to date is very difficult to do and who am I to say update this game? The reason this is a problem is because giving an update to a video game keeps people playing the game with new content and fixes which might have caused problems before. Valve is currently working in Panorama UI which is a welcome change so they do have a reason not to be making any update but in general small updates and fixes (just like the neck hitbox update!) will keep the community happy because they know it is one less problem with the game and you saw how happy the community was when they could finally shoot at somebody from behind and count as a headshot. I am saying that this is a problem only because of the immense amount of money Valve is making from cases and skins and with that sum they probably should be able to keep their game up to date. I have never really played Dota 2 so I am not sure what they are doing with that game but they seem to be doing good as the player count is quite high. 

The ""problem"" with hackers make me feel like people just overreact. I am going to get a lot of hate for this but I have never met a blatant cheater who is spinbotting or using bhop scripts to jump around the map. When I say never I mean it, even in casual or deathmatch I have never met a blatant cheater before. I just feel that people think somebody is cheating just because they are a smurf or just much better at the game. I only reported around 5 players in my entire play time  (because my team wanted me to report them)  and none got banned. I just feel that because people wanted the fairest game possible and just to win they freak out when they see somebody that it better than them. Maybe I am just blind to cheaters but when people just think a good player cheats it really doesn't feel right. 

All of that a side CSGO is definitely still one of my favourite video games and it is still amazing even with all the community complains about. And that was my little review on Counter Strike: Global Offensive and I hope you enjoyed it. Sorry for any mistakes, English is not my first language. :)",True

4733,"The FUTURE of competitive gaming. I expect to see every family playing counter strike together within the decade. Families gathered around the telescreen, waiting for that last final clutch. The father fires one shot from his polished AK, it's wooden gloss glinting in the sun of the map of the year. The shot rings out, from the speakers of the telescreen. In that moment, the son contemplates his life's future. He sees a happy family playing by a white picket fence, his arm around his young wife's waist as they plant the ""SOLD"" sign on the front lawn. The daughter sees her prince charming, as they walk down the aisle together into an endless union of love. The father sees his glory days from college, the boys in his frat, and the touchdown pass he made his senior year. The mother sees herself with the young football star she fell in love with, two young mavericks against the world. The shot hits home, the match is won. The family hugs, their joy clearly visible together. They climb the stairs to bed, and prepare for tomorrow's activities. Tonight was just another normal night, but together they've all experienced something they'll never forget together. As you lay in bed this night, picture that scene in your mind's eye. You, your happy family all gathered to enjoy the future of competitive gaming. That's what Counter Strike Global Offensive was made for.",True
4734,"Counter-Strike: Global Offensive may have been released in August 2012, but the impact it has had on the FPS genre and gaming as a whole, is still prominent today, and is unmatched by most other games.

Firstly, the game runs incredibly well. Despite not managing to match the graphical fidelity of some other big-budget titles, for the most part, it still looks ""decent"" and the visuals will not be an issue whilst you are playing. Although it is still running on the old Source engine, it does not look very dated. Perhaps this old engine is what enables the game to run so well, and the added frame rate is hugely beneficial to your gameplay experience. It is one of the only games where I am able to fully utilize the potential of my 240hz monitor.

Valve's many years of expertise with the Counter-Strike series mean they have a lot of experience in creating fun gun-play that has vast amounts of replayability, and this is extremely apparent. Each fight feels different, even if you are playing on a map you have experienced hundreds of games on. The Design feels extremely polished.

In a competitive enrivonment like Counter-Strike, the ranking system is important. The system, in this case, means that ranking up is not too hard, nor too easy. If you are too good for your rank, you will rank up within a few games. This was apparent as my skill increased, as I was previously stuck in silver for over 2 years, before ranking up from Silver 2 to Gold Nova 1 within 3 months. 

The Valve Anti-Cheat seems to be quite effective in preventing cheaters from becoming widespread. Whilst you may find a cheater every now and then, I have not encountered many in my 481 hours played (at the time of review). It is also worth noting that, in multiple instances, my reporting of cheaters has led to neccessary action from Valve, and this must be commended.

Counter-Strike is also strong in the Esports department, and this has never been more apparent than in CSGO. You feel the same intensity that you would as a player, whilst spectating a match on twitch. The success of Esports in CSGO is apparent with the many viewers it collects during tournaments (especially majors).

In conclusion, my many hours in game (though not as many as lots of other people) demonstrates the quality, and replayability of the game. I may not ever get bored of CSGO, because the game keeps drawing me back after 3 years. Whilst CSGO is not perfect, it comes very close, and is without doubt one of the greatest FPS games of all time.

4739,"Before I start, I will admit, even if I once was a hardcore first person shooter player, I kind of got tired of them over the years. I had Counter Strike Source and Day of Defeat Source, but I pretty much only wanted them for Garry's Mod. The last CS I played for hours and hours was the 1.6 version of the original, and that was over 10 years ago.

Now, after these Summer Sales, I saw CS:GO at 5€. Looking at other ""mainstream serious FPS"" these days, like CoD and Battlefield, that usually go arround the 60-70€, not counting the fuckload of DLC's, it seems like the best deal ever! It actually is?

The awnser is, yes. Oh man, I do still suck a bit at these games after playing nothing but TF2 for when it comes to FPS games, but I still had fun like the old days. The game is done to perfection. Guns work as intended, no stupid recoil like the recoil you see in other shit FPS games, here it looks realistic, and it feels good. The maps are good as well, feel just like the originals, while the new ones add originality, and the ones made by the community are always amazing. The gameplay is smooth. Right now I'm using a shitty PC, since my old one kind of blew up (it probably could not handle my afro), and this piece of crap runs the game without that much issues on low-mid settings, while games like CoD Ghost or Hardline always bring dumb problems because of horrible optimization.

I have like 30 hours so far with this game, and I bought it on the Summer Sales, that ended like a week or two ago. I have been in normal servers, filled with both new and old players, I have tried bots, and I have played 10 matchmaking games so far, and without counting the MM match where I ended with a bunch of Russian assholes who did nothing but to yell crap on their microphone, blame me, and then ragequit, I had nothing but fun. And that's another thing, the community is amazing. Some people might stay silent most of the time, but they won't get THAT mad, unless you really screw up something, or act 100% retard (like dropping your gun at the start of the round, buying nothing, going 1 vs 5 with your knife, and then say that this game is a bad ripoff of Call of Duty. I have found one dude like that, and I think he was not trolling, but totally serious). And well, I did fuck up at times on my first matches, I wasn't used to the new buy menus, the changes of the maps, the new models, I find of teamkilled 2 friends so far, but they where not mad. Probably because they where new too, at some point, and know how it sucks to be THAT guy.

The sale is over, and it doesn't cost 5€ anymore. Still, the full price is like 12€ or so, and if you really like competitive and serious multiplayer FPS action, this is your game, doesn't matter if you're a filthy casual, a nooblord, or the classic ""MLG"" that will probably kill the other team in 30 seconds with 5 bullets, all headshots.

Oh, and while the weapons feel balanced, I got to say that the shotguns are really underrated. Further more, I f#cking love them. It might be because I'm an old-school Unreal Tournament player (I have been in tournaments, and shit), and my favorite weapons from that game was the Flak Cannon, but I find it fairly easy to kill scrubs who tryhard with M4's and AK's with 1 or 2 shoots to the face, while they crouch and spray their bullets all over Mordor. Give them a try if you're new, you won't regret it. If you don't believe it, look at the screenshoot below, at the end. I played nothing but classic pistol rounds and Nova the whole game, and I ended up with 43-18, being the MVP of the match. And I'm not that good, you can probably do it way better than me! Besides, killing 1 player with the Nova gives like 900$, while weapons like the AWP (best Sniper Rifle) only give 100$. What's not to like? And if in the end you find the game boring, just idle on servers. With time, you will get drops and items that you can easily sell in the market. With some time, you will get your money back. I have gotten 2€ so far, just with the new crates, so...

Hitboxes are bugging, everything is bugging, lagging and glitching and all they do is adding new skins and cases. Few of those updates are totally unnecessary. WHO THE FUNK needs some stupid revolvers (almost noone uses them now), nerfed guns and in-game sounds from horse races? The FREAKING ranking system is the highest level of stupidity too.. There're people, who are actually good on low ranks and trolls on higher ranks. 
Please, stop adding these dumb updates and rather ban cheaters. Half of the community use hacks and you're creating some cowboy sheez!

4795,"Welp. I started back in 2014. 2 days after my birthday.  I was a yonger person, with a wallet still. Gaben tickled at my thigh. He wanted that money but no. I did not yet know what was to come of this game. I played, and a few days later (Maybe months cause idk I was new and bad) I got ranked at the amazing Silver IV. I was so proud being a higher rank than all my friends. I felt so good. Then I played faceit for the first time, with around 15 competitive wins so far. It was me, and my friends. British friends. I thought this would be easy, but who knows I thought this was just like regular MM. Then we got 16-0'd. I couldn't turn a corner without getting rekt. 
     Time went on and I found myself with 20$ on my steam. I got 2 normal Global Case Keys and opened 2 cases. Whatever it was, it was shit. Anyway, I got an AWP | Pit Viper, an M4A4 | Urban DDPAT, and a bunch of other crappy stuff.
     This would eventually turn into an addiction. I got my friend knife. A Flip Knife | Scorched (FT) I was so happy. Then I got scammed when I learned what a ""Blue Gem"" was. My shitty blaze pattern AK-47 | Case Hardened (FN) I overpayed a shit ton for. But I was happy, and GabeN soon would be too.
      I went on to be given a Karambit Vanilla from a friend, and like, I still had my AK and everything. 
      I worked the next summer for my father. I earned over 500$. Now if you look in my inventory, its all their. Actually now that I think of it. Its way more than 500$.
      Long story short, This game is very competative and I get Salty (NaCl) all the time. My Highest rank (As of now) was Supreme Master First Class. After the new Update I'm currently LE and probs gonna be back to Silver IV soon.

4887,"A worthy update to Counter-Strike: Source, CS:GO improves upon tons of mechanics that were lack-luster, or made the game too easy to get good at in it's predecessor.  I think it's clearly safe to say this game also removed the stain left in the professional Counter-Strike community after a few CAL judges made unnecessary bans to advance their teams through tournaments.  It's already had almost  two dozen torunaments with multiple professional 5-man teams that many may recognize from CS 1.6.  This game made quick work to fix some things that were decidedly annoying in CS:S, one being the too-often consistent bullet patterns when not on a flat surface(e.g. jumping, surfing, et cetera.)

Some guns have been removed(looking at you MP5, and M3.), although they have been given replacements, and are joined with other new weapons that make the game much more fresh, and keep things interesting.  Overall, combining this with the skin updates that will now be regular, the game can even pay for itself within a few weeks!

The features allowing you to download demos of your games, watch the pros and casual high ranks alike live, and tons of exclusives for watching tournaments not only brings up community morale, but increases the excitement of the game.  You can also link your twitch account to make it all easier.  Very cool.

Community servers are surprisingly still full, and almost as numerous as the last 3 games, even though Competitive play has been enhanced with an ELO system, and ranks to go along with it.  Like always, if you can get good at this game, you'll be good at any First Person Shooter, making it a key title to own and play.

It brings a set of new graphics that are amazing to compare to the other CS games(nostlagia withstanding), made all the better because of Valve's typical work to offload Graphics Processing to the CPU when possible.  For what it's worth, it hardly tolls even low-end GPUs like my current 525M, with maxed settings, and very high levels of  Anti-Aliasing.  I'm able to keep a minimum of 80 Frames Per Second, and average about 150.

All in all, I'm pleased to say that I have over 600 hours sunk into this game, and am only about 200 hours off surpassing my CS:S playtime as of writing.  Valve did an amazing job with this game, and I can't wait to see what it's successor in Source 2 will look like!",True

4889,"First of all, I'm sorry for my english, it's not my native language but I wanted to do this Review in english for more people to understand it ^.^

It would be quite difficult to count up positive and negative things in this game because it all depends on who you play with!
For Example the voicechat - It is one of the most important things in CsGo Matchmaking! Making calls for your teammates often are deciding  whole games (if you do them correctly), BUT there often are some people trying to be funny and just scream random stuff in their mics nobody can understand nor use as information.

I wouldn't say the Community is bad in this game, there are some really nice people and I also made some good friends by playing this game or trading ingame skins. But again there are some a**holes just being jerks.. Blocking players in the Competetive mode on purpose for example. But hey, those probably exist in any kind of Multiplayergame and we need to deal with them.

The VAC-System. VAC really is a good AntiCheatSystem, but nobody ever will understand that it is impossible to detect every cheat and as soon as there is one little cheatercunt with no balls, the people need to blame VAC.
As I said, I do not think it's bad, but in my opinion Valve should definetly think about cooperating with other Anticheat-Systems to get rid of more Hacks.

I can't tell you a lot about the gameplay itself. For my part I play the game for fun, of course I try to climb up the ranks and try to reach the Global Elite [GE], but mostly I'm just surfing around (Surf is an inofficial gamemode which already exists for quite a long time on private servers - I won't tell you any more about it, if you want to know what it is you can just search for it on youtube/google) with friends.

I'm not a professional player  at all and I also gotta admit that I started with Global Offensive which means I can't tell you a lot about the development over the years, but during the one and a half year I'm playing this game a lot of amazing Updates came up which made the game better and better.

I hope I'll be able to experience a lot more Gameplay-improving Updates which also make the game better!

4890,"Was a good game, the thing that really dissappoints me is the competitive matchmaking, i still remember one match one guy never comes and one guy just abandon and the rest are novas but their deaths were more than their kills. And also one match an 'unranked' guy joins in a game full of novas. If you come here to play casual, this is the stuff. But if you wanna play competitive, good luck. Matchmaking is not good. Also there's some ban also in-game. The ban hammer. Stay frosty!

Please extend the connection time left for a player to 10 minutes, my laptop isn't that fast because I can't afford a really good gaming laptop yet. My laptop often gets bluescreen so please extend the time.

If your new to this game and want to progress, start by playing Gun Game and Casual.
Practice on custom aim maps to help you on your quest to improve your overall skill. If you just want to have fun with it, then so be it!  

Competitively this game takes teamwork, dedication, endurance, consistency, map knowledge, nade placement, counter-strafing, mouse tracking and imhuman reactions!
If your still using a ball mouse or a crappy laser mouse, f☺cking forget it, don't buy and install this game, all your tears will turn to wine! At it's core CS:GO is a skill-based competitive shooter. 

Continuous updates, bug fixes, operations, community made maps, weapon skins, stickers, 
map-editor, etc etc, it has longevity and will keep you coming back for more!
Personally I have a love hate relationship with this game, when losing really sucks and winning will send shivers through your shaft. Whether it may be, getting a 4k or even an Ace in a comp match! Missing an easy shot on an unsuspected opponent, only to get dinked by a 180 flick-shot and losing the match! This game will always be a staple in the FPS community and on the competitive scene.

4925,"[h1]Basic Information[/h1]
Title: Counter Strike : Global Offensive
Developer: Hidden Path Entertainment and Valve Corporation
Publisher: Valve Corporation
Genre: FPS Shooter 

[h1]General Impresion[/h1]
Like the previous games in the series, Global Offensive is an objective-based multiplayer first-person shooter. Each player joins either the Terrorist or Counter-Terrorist team and attempts to complete objectives or eliminate the enemy team.

Players purchase weapons and equipment at the beginning of every round with money awarded based on their performance. Completing objectives or killing  enemies earns the player money while negative actions, like killing a teammate or hostage, takes money away from the player. In addition, when a round ends all players receive some amount of money, with players on the winning team receiving substantially more. 

Currently, Global Offensive features five game modes for online play : Classic, Competitive, Arms Race, Demolition and Deathmatch. For competitive mode you need to reach rank 3 by playing in other modes. 

In my opinion, CSGO is the most realistic FPS Shooter that I ever played.

4934,"Many years ago I was drafted for this war. I was in the most deadly battle you could think of. I had lost all hope of survival and my team was loseing left and right. Then in my darkest hour I saw something that inspired me to keep fighting. It was single chicken that ran by and then I was inspired to fight for my freedom and I died but then I came back into the world.
I think the reason was because I had not completed what I had started, I had not shown honor to the chicken yet, but then I saw a group of chickens and thats when I saw the holy chicken the one that I had saw in my time of darkness and I talked to it and became friends with thy chicken. Soon 2 enemys saw me I was traped with no escape I only managed to kill one of them and thats when the other shot but then out of no where the holy chicken flew down and sacrificed his life so that I had time to kill the other and survive. I still think of this chicken today and how he could have left me to die...but he didnt. he sacrificed himself for me as I think of him I shed a single tear  and remember the fun times we had. How on that day he changed my life and inspired me that there is still hope in this dark world. How things can get better. From that day I said to myself I will keep fighting, that I will make sure that his death was not in vain and to honor all chickens not just him! You can honor the holy chicken to. All you have to do is purchase this game and fight for the chicken and for what is right!

10/10 Would honor the chicken again.

4941,"The world of Counter-Strike has changed much since its inception as a mod for the original Half-Life, but its core has largely remained the same – until now. [i]Counter-Strike: Global Offensive (CS: GO)[/i] has done away with one official game play mode and has added a few more to spice things up.

Classic modes remain, but they now come in two flavors: Casual and Competitive. A popular mod created for [i]Counter-Strike: Source (CS:S)[/i] was “Gun Game”; it’s now here and called “Arms Race”. Finally, the newest edition is a mix of Classic and Arms Race, called “Demolition”

[i]Counter-Strike: Global Offensive[/i] features eleven pistols, six shotguns, eight submachine guns, eleven assault rifles, six sniper rifles, two machine guns, a knife, six kinds of grenades, six pieces of equipment, four game modes, fourteen standard maps in competitive matches, and an integrated matchmaking system, tournament viewing system, statistics tracking system with leaderboards, and inventory system that allows the player to collect weapon skins and other items that result in cosmetic alterations and no gameplay alterations.

The game is still using the Source engine but this doesn’t mean that it hasn’t received a major overhaul in the graphics department. The graphics in [i]Counter-Strike: Global Offensive[/i] are in a realistic style. They depict an Italian village, Middle Eastern villages, an office, and other locations, plus weapons, players, and weapon skins, some of which are in bright neon colors like pink or blue. The sounds include footsteps that players make when running and not when walking or crouching; gunshots; and the voices of characters that say things like “throwing a flashbang” and “throwing smoke.” The music is orchestral in style and alters dynamically based on what is occurring in the match.

Players in have one hundred health and can be killed with three or four bullets from many guns, or fewer if the bullets hit the player’s head. Players can purchase armor to protect their body and a helmet to protect their head. This allows players to survive more bullet shots from some guns. Other guns, like assault rifles and sniper rifles, can kill players with one or two shots whether or not the player is wearing armor. Players run faster if they have their knife or sidearm out. Guns dropped by dead players can be picked up by other players and the game notes who the weapon originally belonged to in the spectator screen. The models of the characters alter depending on the map that is being played.

-Large number of maps
-Replayable

4942,"It started back in the 8th grade when I was put in ELL. I was surrounded by retards and no matter how much I begged the principal to let me out of there he kept telling me I was also retarded and there was no way I would suceed in life. I spent days in the ELL classroom learning with people I hated and puzzles I couldn't solve. Coloring inside the lines was not only unacheiveable but I had to watch the coolest kid in ELL Eli Chubin do every day. It wasn't fair I wasn't like the rest of these kids I could do 20 pull ups! If the principal wouldn't advance me to regular classes I would have to it myself. Using the problem solving skills that landed me in ELL I devised the plan to kill every other person in the class because then I have to be moved up, I mean they couldn't have a class just for 1 person right? I searched online to find out how other people did mass murders and it seemed like the most efficient way was with shooting the place up so I decided that was what I would do. I didn't know where to start though so I searched online once again to find out how all these murderers started. I quickly learned that it was violent video games was the thing that all these murderers had in common so I decided that must be the thing that makes killers. I then bought Counter Strike as I heard you could learn how to be a terrorist and played it every day after school. After a week of playing I felt the evil inside of me and I was ready to shoot up the school. Using what I had learned from Counter Strike and the guns I borrowed from my father I went into ELL that day and killed every kid in my class. As a result of that I got moved up into regular classes just like I hoped would happen. Without Counter Strike I would still be in ELL to this day.",True

allways beg someone who has beter skins to give you skins.
roast the enemy multiple times without knowing your team loses.
Try to be Scream once, Failed. Failed horribly because the shot didnt even hit.
What are hitboxes?
Case so rigged only youtubers get knife.
Tried to list an item that is cheap, and sell it 100x more than the original price.
Beg your friends for skins, get skins. Later, lose skins.
gambling so hard you lose all your items in it.

meanwhile prices these days.

4969,"As a player with huge heart for Quake 3 Arena I used to hate Counter-Strike without really trying to play it. I just saw that people really camp a lot there and something like running or strafing isn't a real option there.. 

But the the Summer sales on Steam hit me right into my head and I decided to give CS go a try. I've tried the CS 1.6 and Source too but as it is now, ppl mostly play CS:GO so I sticked to that. I spend quite a lot of time on this game, I don't think I'm bad.. guess some of my aim and call for fast thinking from Quake was left in me :).

Conclusion: CS:GO is a nice FPS game, maybe too good graphics for me, cause sometimes it's really hard to see the enemy or to determine if it's a friend or an enemy :D.. anyway as long as it's a team game I recommend playing it with friends, because random ppl not always know what TEAMplay does mean.

5042,"CS:GO (Counter-Strike: Global Offensive) is an (Online) First Person Shooter game.
The game is very similar to the other Counter-Strike games out there, but this one is special,
it has new maps, new types of play style, a great community (edit 2019, also a toxic community) & of course skins.

It's basically the type of game that you could play for hours and still never get bored of it
(thanks to a growing community, new maps etc.)
This game isn't a hardcore ''MLG-Pro 360 No Scope'' Simulator like Call of Duty
This is basically an awesome game. (edit 2019, not really that awesome)

Now to the part why you should buy it..

As I wrote before, you could play for hours and still enjoy it.
This game is not too expensive yet not too cheap.
It could get expensive, if you get into buying skins and such, but that's just your choice.

GAMEPLAY:

Gun sounds are good you could recognize every gun, and pretty realistic. (Atleast in my opinion)

Sound quality is good, especially if you have good quality headphones. (Footsteps etc. is good to listen to for improved gameplay)

Aiming and such is very diffrent to other games but is easy to master if you change your crosshair and your sensitivity to what you like and feel comfortable with.

Many positive points to be noticed: Great graphics (for a cs game) and Satisfying gameplay that can
make you unable to stop playing, especially if playing with friends.

On the negatives, compared to the previous titles, it has many things that devs could fix/improve. Plus, the matchmaking system is not working as expected, and as it seems, no serious efforts are made to change that.

Last but not least, i have to point that the cs go community is likely the worst.

Still, worth buying.

5049,"After being around CS since the olden days, back when we had WONIDs and such...this is a drastic change. In a good way.

I still kept playing 1.6 for awhile, even after CSS was released, my PC couldn't handle it, but I was more than satisfied with what 1.6 had to offer. Once I upgraded my PC and was able to jump into CSS, it was nto what I..expected. It did not go over well with the way I had gotten used to CS 1.6. I stopped playing CSS and went back to 1.6. 

I got into the beta of CS GO once it was announced, tried out ok: Ok, seems to work like 1.6, but with CSS visual..this is nice.
The game actually plays very well, it does have some drastic changes from what we <1.6 vets remember. I think Wayne Campbell said it best: In many ways it's superior but will never be as recognized as the original.

Sound and music are well done also.  

I like the stat and achievement tracking feature it has.  I also like the fact that it has bot support for when I do not feel like dealing with whiny 10 year old punk kids.  I enjoyed checking the new maps and gameplay options out, they are a lot of fun & challenging.

CS:GO is a great addition to the franchise.  I highly recommend picking this up for the low price tag it is being offered for.  I look forward to all the new content that Valve has in store for CS:GO as well.  That is the great thing about CS is its mod support and added content that unlike Battlefield and COD you seem to have to pay for or its no as user friendly for mods.

However, if you want to have adrenaline rush filled hours, full of rage, fake hype for nothing, money waste on pixels AND OCCASIONALLY once a year, maybe twice, that one perfect match, with the perfect team and no cheaters around, that'll give you that satisfaction like never before when and if you win?

5074,"Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, or CS:GO for short, is a highly competitive skill-based game. This is what makes it so great, learning the maps, all of the different tactics, improving your aim and managing the economy. This however, can be a long grind. Every map has its own calls, grenade spots to learn and positions to play.

CS:GO runs great (although every updates costs FPS), has some great design, and decent graphics for an older game. Updates come regularly to add stuff (Most of the updates are skins and other things, but that doesn't make the game bad) and Valve keeps improving the game. A big downside of CS:GO however is the big amount of cheaters. If you don't link your phone number to the game and play in ""prime matchmaking"" the game can be literally unplayable. This can be very frustrating, especially when you're doing your best to rank up and improve. 

Aim and sound play an important role in CS:GO, more than in most other shooters. Every gun has it's own recoil pattern to learn and it's own unique playstyle. Since CS:GO requires a lot more tactics than most other shooters, aim also very important. Having your crosshair at the right position means you can take your opponent down faster. Lots of practice, playing aim maps, helps and using your sound to locate your enemy's footsteps gives you a big advantage. The CS:GO e-sports scene is also massive. Millions of people follow it and it's a great place to learn. Use this to your advantage. Want know those new tactics, boosts and smoke/flashes? Watch some games! You can honestly learn a lot from watching the pros play. 

Now of course, you saw this one coming, the community can be really... annoying. Especially at lower ranks, the community is full of toxic kids, people who have no idea what they are doing and teammates who refuse to work together. This can be harsh, especially because CS:GO heavily relies on teamwork. That's why I recommend playing this game with friends. The faster you're out of those low ranks the better! Once you get a bit higher you'll see the community gets better and better (with the occasional toxic/clueless player of course). People work together, people give useful information and are just a bit nicer to work with in general.

Next to competitive, CS:GO also has some gamemodes for people who just want to have some fun and don't care about ranks or tactics. Gamemodes like: Arms Race, Deathmatch and Casual are great for this and the thousands of community servers offer cool things like: surfing, aim training, roleplay, minigames and more!

Now, would I recommend CS:GO? Sure! Especially for the small amount of money it costs. Just don't expect this to be another casual shooter. It's a highly skilled game and requires you to put in a lot of time to improve. Pick this up with a couple of friends so there's less of a chance of having these annoyances.",True

There’s something to be said for a game that knows what it is and executes that idea well.

UPDATE 1: I have stopped playing as I feel I am quite shit at the game, wasting 400 hours on  a game that never gave me the enjoyment that other games did.

[b] Overview	 [/b]

Counter Strike: Global Offensive (CS:GO or GO for short) is an online tactical and first-person shooter. The aim of the game depends on the game mode. Game modes consist of modes like Demolition and Hostage Rescue.

[b] Modes	 [/b]

In Demolition, the Terrorists (T for short) have to plant a bomb at one of two sites, Site A or Site B. The Counter-Terrorists (CT for short) have to stop the Terrorists by erradicating the enemy team. Each player starts off with a standard pistol and $800, which they can buy other weapons and gear with. As you progress through the game, winning or losing, you gain more cash to get bigger and better weapons. The first to win 16 rounds wins.

In Hostage Rescue, the Terrorists most ""protect"" the hostages from the Counter-Terrorists while the Counter-Terrorists must take the hostages to the evac zone marked in green on the minimap. If either team erradicates the other, they win.

In Casual, your rank is not affected by your wins/loses. Other modes, like surfing and ""Cas Team Deathmatch"" are in here.

5115,"Well, by far my favourite game but also the most frustrating game : each time you improve, each time you realize you need to train more and more to be even better. 

Good thing about that game is the constant changes made by the devs listening (or not) to the community.  

Bad thing is there's still a lot of things to fix before getting a superior game (128tick, 1min30 rounds and 35 secs bomb timer where are you) 

Community is a good and funny as toxic and sad.

If you just want to own people without learning any game mechanic, go back to CoD or Battlefield.
If you want to improve, play some quite good competitive game (on mm or third party server) that game is for you. 
I'm not a soloQ player, so all i can give for an advice is find friends/teammates to play that game : even if you can't win all your games, it's still more fun like that and it's one of the best way to improve, unless you're playing with the wrong people.

5185,"I don't really like this game but mostly because of my preference/opinions, CS:GO isn't really a casual game but more focused to competitive people who have GB/sec internet and can run games smoothly and use every trick in the book to use against you. However from other people's experience that I have talked to, public competitive matches is not the way to go due to the different types of players it matches you up with. For example you have a ""smurf"" which is a high ranking competitive player using an alt or some other way to change his/her rank so its low....that way they get pitted against new players for target practice. Also a large majority of people on Steam get VAC banned due to abusing hacks in CS:GO, even top of the line players can be using some form of hack.

This review only scratches the surface of it but needless to say a lot of people may not like this game as I have, not to say its bad...its just not something I cant mess about on to enjoy without the seriousness like the filthy casual I am. :3",True

5207,"[b]Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is a multiplayer first-person shooter video game, there are two teams competing against each other one being terrorist and the other being counter terrorist. The aim of the game on the terrorist side is to plant a bomb and defend it so it cannot be defused before the end of the round. On the other hand, you have the counter terrorist which are a team trying to defuse the bomb or kill all the of the opposing team members before the bomb has been planted. You can also play a game mode were terrorists hold hostages and defend them and the counter terrorists obviously try to rescue them and take them to a safety zone. You must play a casual match which is mainly played to warm up or just to have some friends with you friends if you’re not the competitive type. You can play a competitive match which is for the more competitive players that want to win and gain experience and rank up. You can play death match where it is every man for themselves and the more kills you get the more points you gain, the person with the highest points at the end of the match will be at the top of the leader-board. You can play arms race which is very like gun game from Call of Duty Black Ops but for those who are unfamiliar with gun game it is basically a race to the best weapon, you start off with a bad weapon and then every kill you get you will be able to upgrade to a better gun up until you reach the golden knife where you will be required to knife someone. The first person to knife someone will win. And personally, I don't feel the need to explain demolition due to the fact it is practically the same to arms race. There are lots of other ways of playing such as community maps which are maps made by other players for you to play on with a VAST variety of different game modes. If you aren't the type of person to play online you can play offline with bots but I highly recommend playing online.

Well that concludes the first ever Ultimate Profiles Review so I hope you enjoyed and learnt some information about the game.

5210,"Counter Strike: Global Offensive is the second most popular game on Steam (only beaten by dota 2) and I am going to try to explain why.

Pros:
-Community: The community is friendly (for the most part) you will run into people that are assholes but they are rarer than you would think. I play on the NA servers so unless you are in the UK I wouldn't worry about Russians.

-Gunplay: The gunplay in CS GO is unrivaled by any other game in the FPS genre, it is fun and skill based with a unique (at least I havent seen it anywhere else) recoil system. (The bullets will always follow a set pattern with small amounts of variation)
 
-Community Servers: Many people and orginazations have CS GO servers, some are competitive some are DM and some are surf servers. Many different gamemodes mean that even if you dislike the competitive side of things you can find something you enjoy.

-Active Economy: CS GO has a skin economy which is part of the reason valve keeps updating it with new content (no it's not because Gaben loves you) this economy offers opportunities that are rare to come across, you can invest some money in skins and trade with other players to make a profit. (Don't expect it to be quick or easy though)

Cons:
-Gambling: CS GO has a system where as you play the game you get drops (Cases or low-grade skins) and if you get a case you have the choice to open it for about two dollars, or let it sit in your inventory, if you chose to open it you get a random drop of a random rarity, no-one ever makes their money back and I would recommend against case openings. Just buy the skins you want.

-Smurfs: Smurfs are people that are a higher rank than you and buy the game on another account so they can play with lower rank people, some do it to win easy games and some do it to play with friends I can understand wanting to play with your bros, but just wanting to shit on people's day is kind of rude.

-Its a Job: You have to play this game almost daily or at least play one deathmatch to retain your skill, I didn't play for about a month and I found that after coming back I was terrible (I still am but I was less so before) don't get it if you want to play it on and off (unless you just wanna surf)


While I can't say it is unique I can say it's one of the only FPS games to hold my attention in years and I would recommend it to anyone who has friends that will play it with them or wants to get into competitive gaming,",True

5216,"I have been playing CS:GO for a fairly long time and looking back on it I have a lot of memories both good and bad thanks to CS:GO, all those nights I stayed up solo queing or playing with friends, all the days I spent playing instead of revising for exams (RIP) and CS:GO allowed me to meet lots of people and become involved in things I never thought I would. The thing I still love to this day is that this game can be fun even if none of your friends have it or you have no friends. Solo queing can be risky as you can meet strange foreigners or just get bad team mates all round, ut thats part of the fun. I would also reccomend not buying this game if you have exams coming up.

I had met some great people and obviously once in a while you encounter the odd d1ckh34d, but the addiction of playing made me join teams and even start my own team with friends and eventually became a competitive team while being sponsored. This was something I never thought would have ever happened to me and its a memory that will stay with me forever. Happiness is when you play CS so well, that people call you a hacker.

Although CS:GO has lots of great aspects and the community has some great people...This game has become such a meme I can't even bring myself to play it anymore. The amount of Russians swearing down the mic, which by the way is potato quality and all the swedish 13yr olds thinking they will be a Fnatic or NiP player is unreal. The community has become so toxic and just unbareable that its essentially ruined the game for me. Feel free to disagree if you love the community but thats just me.  

Basically... Buy the game if you want an addictive tactical FPS game but bewarned the game is such a meme and the community is so cancerous that you may hate the game fairly quickly. 

Thank you for a great 1000hrs CS:GO but its time to grow up and move on from the cancerous 13yr olds",True

5236,"I am happy to join with you today in what will go down in history as the greatest demonstration for freedom in the history of this game.

1/10 score years ago, a great American, in whose symbolic shadow we stand today, signed the Valve Game Submission Contract. This momentous decree came as a great beacon light of hope to millions of Terrorist slaves who had been seared in the flames of withering injustice. It came as a joyous daybreak to end the long night of their captivity.

But two years later, the Terrorist is still is not free. Two years later, the life of the Terrorist is still sadly crippled by the manacles of the M4A1-S and the chains of Counter-Terrorists. Two years later, the Terrorist lives on a lonely island of poverty in the midst of a vast ocean of material prosperity. Two years later, the Terrorist is still languished in the corners of Counter-Terrorist society and finds himself an exile in his own land. And so we've come here today to dramatize a shameful condition.

In a sense we've come to our nation's capital to cash a check. When the architects of our republic wrote the magnificent words of the Trade-Up Contract, they were signing a promissory note to which every player was to fall heir. This note was a promise that all men, yes, Terrorist men as well as Counter-Terrorist men, would be guaranteed the ""unalienable Rights"" of ""Deagle, AWP, and the pursuit of Bomb Sites."" It is obvious today that Counter Strike has defaulted on this promissory note, insofar as her players of Terrorism are concerned. Instead of honoring this sacred obligation, Counter Strike has given the Terrorist people a bad check, a check which has come back marked ""insufficient funds.""

But we refuse to believe that the bank of justice is bankrupt. We refuse to believe that there are insufficient funds in the great vaults of opportunity of this game. And so, we've come to cash this check, a check that will give us upon demand the riches of Deagle and the security of AWP.

Valve has done an amazing job creating and developing the game, but at the same time they p1$$ed on all their work. 

I believe it's all business, and it's all for money.
Many players are banned because they cheat and are forced to buy the game again.
And people who don't cheat need to switch the matchmaking to Faceit , Esea , etc.
VAC is extremely weak. Anybody can cheat!.

I have reported cheaters on support.steampowered.com and no one replied.

I bookmarked the steamid of the suspect players to see when they get Overwatch or VAC but aren't banned because they play 1 game a day so they won't get into the overwatch session and they can't get banned even when they play with ragebot. 
Reports on the profiles and tickets are useless. 

I am now “training” against cheaters because I have no choice. I win/lose being able to maintain myself in Global Elite .
I don’t think there’s a match without me facing at least one cheater.

I came to the conclusion that Faceit has a really good Anti-Cheat , but it's frustrating that Valve refused to secure the game better against cheaters.
I feel like I play on Faceit for nothing. I can abandon any match because I don’t care, I have nothing to lose, nothing motivates me.

I really want Valve to secure the game and to eliminate the cheaters. It would be a much better game.
CS:GO could be the best game in the world if they would think about the community and if this wouldn't be only about money and people buying the game. I understand every game has cheaters, but if you really have the resources to stop them, why not? They created this game and instead of being proud of it, they just don't care, they just care about the money. Soon there's going to be matches like cheaters vs cheaters .

I am guessing that is the normal logic for calling out cheaters. But, if you can ignore the brain dead  little kids, and play the game, then your experience whatever you make it can be fun.

5281,"I stand there surveying the battlefield, full of my deceased comrades. During that time i had two things on my mind, one being that my fate determines on this moment, and that my AWP Redline looks intimidating with my newly added ""Welcome to the Clutch"" sticker. With that boost of confidence I ready myself for whatever comes next. I then instinctivly tap 'tab' to see what im going up against, and mutter under my breath, ""Pshhh 1v3.... eZ."" I then approach the bombsite where i come in sight of my prey. I stare the target down like a fat boy eyeing a stick of butter. Deciding to make my move I lick my finger, gathering as much saliva as possible, and cram it down the subjects ear. He screams in agonizing pain, and torture. I know I must finish him, so I grasp for his bloomers, and pull. Thus summoning an atomic wedgie which instantly incapacitates the man. Knowing what I have done I cannot help but tea bag the corspe a few times. Meanwhile I recieve a message stating that the bomb was planted. I suddenly stop the nonsense and move on to my next set of victims. Which were going to be tougher to crack than the first. I think of what I am going to do next, knowing I do not have much time, so I do what is best. I conjure my inner animal. Resulting to me being restrained to using the Deagle in a showy manner. I then come into sight of the bombsite, to abruptly run into my pursuers. My inner animal guides me toward my desiard location, and fires resulting in a collateral killing them both. In shock, I swiftly head towards the bomb knowing it will go off at any moment. But all worries fade when I am quickly informed by a gentleman on the opposing team, that F10 is a shortcut for instant defuse. Before executing the task, I mutter,""idiot."" And spam the F10 key as fast as I can with my right index finger, overcome with joy I begin my victory chant to celebrate our win.

5293,"Death is a great teacher. Failure in Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is, as it always has been for this series, the greatest way to learn where you should have gone, what you shouldn't have done, and how you could have done better. Counter-Strike players spend a lot of time learning -- consequently, they are always getting better.

 Growth is an important factor in Global Offensive, especially if you're coming into Counter-Strike fresh or after a sabbatical. This is an extremely hardcore, skill-based first-person shooter, and it forces you to think differently than other modern shooters. If you’re a Call of Duty player, you’re going to need to change your play style to succeed here. Counter-Strike also tries developing into something new here as well, despite doing little to push itself beyond what it’s always done best. Global Offensive modifies old maps to keep veterans on their toes, and introduces official new modes that encourage different play styles for the first time in almost 15 years.

 For the uninitiated, Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is a small-scale, team-based first-person shooter with permanent death. When a counter-terrorist kills a terrorist planting explosives in a classic Defusal match, or a CT escort swallows a sniper round in Hostage Rescue, the victim is dead for good and doesn't respawn until the next round. As such, players on both sides must exercise skill and care. The bomb objective, meanwhile, gives everyone a purpose. Of course matches end when everyone on a team is dead, but a clever and coordinated terrorist team will give the CTs the slip, plant their bomb, and protect the bomb site. Between rounds, everyone spends earned cash on better gear and guns, and the cycle continues.

 Pieces of the Counter-Strike formula are dated at this point, but the superb heart and soul of Global Offensive is timeless. Teams are small, guns are lethal, and rounds are short. There's an addictive just-one-more-round quality to it, because there's a constant desire to do better than last time, to earn a satisfying kill, or to win in a new way. Call of Duty and Battlefield vets will wonder why they can't sprint to escape enemy fire or look down the iron sights to improve aim; Counter-Strike players will feel like they walked into their redecorated home. Certain map redesigns will catch hardcore fans off guard, but the changes are for the best -- the underpass choke point in de_dust, for instance, has a new escape route.

 Even in the face of genre evolution, Global Offensive doesn’t care to adapt. CSGO is so dedicated to Counter-Strike's aging ideals despite market and trend changes that it brute-forces its way to success. Part of what makes it such an engaging competitive game is that killing in Global Offensive requires a wholly different skill set than other shooters. Everyone is limited to what they have and can see, with little room for character modification or on-the-fly advantages. Running and gunning is a useless play style, even if you've bought a helmet and kevlar that round, to the point that someone standing still is more likely to score the kill. Walking, crouching, or standing are your best bets to reduce the inaccurate spray of machine-gun fire.

 Consequently, killing in Global Offensive feels good. There's a sickening sensation to dropping someone dead because you know they're not coming back. It's also satisfying knowing you used limited resources to play smarter than your victim. If players aren't watching corners, providing covering fire, or using smoke grenades and flashbangs, they're more likely to take a headshot from a more delicate and patient triggerman. The desire to experience that distinct feeling is a strong motivator to keep playing, even when you're getting steamrolled by an obviously better team.

 If you've played Counter-Strike before, Global Offensive probably sounds a whole lot like Counter-Strike. Like Counter-Strike: Source before it, Global Offensive exists simply to modernize the look of the classic competitive shooter, while doing little to disrupt the core form and function. At the same time, it does enough to color outside the lines of tradition to justify your time and effort.

 Fire is one of the most interesting new combat variables. Molotov cocktails and incendiary grenades either roast groups of guys or force them in another direction. Flames are a useful distraction or scare tactic, too. They're particularly useful during Demolition matches, which focus the fight at a single bomb site rather than giving terrorists two to pick between. The new and modified maps in this mode aren't as big as classic Counter-Strike arenas – entire sections have been cut off to direct teams toward a central location – but their thoughtful design is as intricate as ever. The Lake map is a standout -- there's a wide open yet densely populated yard around the bomb site, which is inside a sizable lakeside home with plenty of vantage points and hiding spots. To separate Demolition from Defusal, players can't buy between rounds. Instead, it takes a cue from the other new mode, Arms Race, in which each kill unlocks another weapon instantly. The better you do, the more you have to switch up the way you play, and because Demolition is so fast you'll need to be quick on your feet.

 Unlike other game types, Arms Race allows for respawns. It's the most chaotic and care-free mode in Global Offensive, with players throwing caution to the wind for the sake of climbing the kill ladder as quickly as possible. It's a shame there are only two maps in Arms Race -- a problem that will more likely persist on consoles than PC.

 If you have the option, playing the PC version is unquestionably the best way to experience Counter-Strike: Global Offensive. Mods, mouse and keyboard, and the usual PC-only options are better than the ports. Plus, Valve is much better about long-term PC support -- it abandoned Team Fortress 2 on consoles, and Portal 2's level editor was PC exclusive. If you prefer to play on consoles, Global Offensive is the same great game!",True

- Good Graphics.
- Balanced.
- Good Match Making System.
- Good Trading Community.
- Steam Workshop Support.
- 5 vs 5 Combat.
- 1st Person Shooter.



[h1][u]Cons:[/u][/h1]
- People Trick the Match Making system so they play with lower ranked people so they never get out of their tier.
- People Troll and Mic Spam a lot.
- No Single Player.
- Missions coins that you buy will Permanently expire whenever Valve wants them to so you can no longer play Missions.



[h1][u]Conclusion:[/u][/h1]
This game is a Team-Based shooter that has not single player missions, it is a Multiplayer Only game. This game has nice graphics that suit the style of the game and also has well made maps. Some maps are made by the Community and so are almost all Gun Skins, gun skins are very well made and are the little bit ion top that makes this game a lot better. This game is nicely made and it mainly consists of 5 vs 5 combat with other people. The only this that makes this game a little bit worse is the lack of help that is given whenever you report someone for being trolls and things like that.

5323,"""It's like Skyrim with guns!"" - IGN 

The game really does offer the decisive RPG role that very little First-Person games offer. Unfortunately, it incorporates a lot of mechanics from the popular MMORPG, World of Warcraft and can at times feel like a complete clone. If you haven't played WoW, you will enjoy it, but if you have you will feel some obvious and uncomfortable similarities. The game's singleplayer is really expansive and really allows the player to explore the mystical world, known as ""Pandora"" and offers you to play as 1 of 4(at one given time) playable characters, all with unique personalities and trates. Brick - A slow tanky character, who at times can seem very stupid but as the game progresses his soft side opens up and you can see him as a caring personality. Roland - A military-type, honorable character who at times can seem like a pervert, who spies on young children. You can often find him stealing other characters televisions and smoking blunts. Mordecai - The only homosexual member of the group, can be found in massive orgies. His fetish is bleeding anuses. Lilith - A complete autistic, psychopath who can be found having sex with skags and fondling herself. 
The characters enrole in the US military, where they will fight their way throughout a Chinese insurgency.  The campaign really demonstrates the power of the games ""Frostbite 3 engine"" and really drops the players jaw at any given moment.


The multiplayer can be described as ""Call of Duty with swords"" and offers 4 playable classes, Knight, Vanguard, Man at arms and Archer. All of which are equally effective in the art of combat. The mutliplayer takes place in 14th century Europe where being heterosexual was a crime and gay orgies were public(which later resulted in the spread of the black plague) so don't let your kids play, because they might immitate the gay orgies that the NPC's participate in.

There is nothing like being the last one alive on your team and clutching it. It's not an easy game to learn, as a former CoD player, I had to adapt to the more realistic accuracy. Even with over 600 hours of it by the time of this review, I'm nowhere near good. I'm a silver elite and I seem stuck at a certain skill level. With gamemodes such as deathmatch, arms race, and casual, there is plenty to check out. The market system is addicting and you will soon find yourself broke, but it all feels worth it when you get a great skin. It really isn't because of how much you had to spend, but all that matters is if you are enjoying yourself. As for the community it's...ugh. You want racism? We got it. You want annoying memes? We got it. You want 5 year olds screaming? We got it. You want mic spammers? We got it. You want sexism? That too. Long story short - it sucks. But it has the ""block communication"" feature so use it. It isn't all bad though, you will find great teammates who will back you up, give good callouts and are overall decent people.

5344,"Counter Strike: Global Offensive is one of the best FPS (First Person Shooter) game i have ever played. This game requires alot of time if you want to be better at it. Not only aiming at the head, this game requires a Team Work, Strategy, Game Sense, Knowledge, etc. There's 5 game modes on this game, like Deathmatch, Casual (10v10 Players), Competitive (5v5 Players), Demolition and Arms Race. In competitive mode, theres a rank system from =
      1.Silver 1 (Lowest Competitive Rank)
      2.Silver 2
      3.Silver 3
      4.Silver 4

To get your ""Real"" rank, you have to win 10 Competitive Matches to see what rank you are in.

First thing you're going to want do in this game is turn on the developer console! 

Do so in the options then proceed to type: [code]voice_enable 0[/code] and [code]ignoremsg[/code] in the console

No more toxic game :) 


So, I hate this game, and I also love this game. It's my marmite.
Skins, don't get me started on skins, they've become an obsession, gambling, buying from websites - All of it. I love the skins, I hate the addiction, seeing 12 year old little kids betting and begging on gambling websites is a sad state for Valve to leave this situation. The bans on gambling did nothing, gambling sites still run, case sites still run, and daily you can watch people literally take a match to a stack of thousands of dollars in virtual skins. Don't get me wrong, I'm not against gambling in general, just the unrestricted unmoderating gambling we have at the moment, where addicts and children are doomed into a circling the drain every time they get skins or money - Gamble fucking responsibly and you can end up with an inventory like mine.

But skins aside, CSGO stands out in the FPS genre because of the mechanics. I came from Battlefield and Rust, this was a hard game to get into, rewiring my run and gun mind into being stationary and shooting took a while, along learning the spray patterns, finding guns you're good with, and staying the fuck away from the ones you're not. So GoldNova/MG (my rank) was always filled with horrendous smurfs and hackers pre-prime, it was horrendous, but now with a mechanic to link accounts to a phone number after you reach X amount of levels, it's awesome! Gone are the days when someone would get VAC'd and purchase another copy off the grey market.

Now matchmaking or casual? When I first started I spent my first like 15 account levels in casual, it was easy, pretty chill, and no risks if you drop out early. But it gives little xp, and little reward for taking part. At most learning the guns in casual is the best thing you can do when you join.

Matchmaking - the sum of all my rage in-game on CSGO. Mind you, its a lot of fun, when it is going good. Tactical, fun, thrilling, everything you want out of a game. But when its not, when you think you're up against a hacker, or a smurf, it's enraging, I've heard people smash screens, throw phones, punch stuff, the usual competitive shit, and with a community like CSGO sometimes has, it just fuels the fire. However, 75% of the players are awesome: vocal, friendly, helpful. Everything you could want out of a game that takes a lot to learn. And on the other hand are the people that need to be kept away from the internet, I'll leave it at that.

Now I could get into the broken mechanics and how Valve only focus on money making methods because this review would end up 3 or 4 times longer. But in all reality adding different gun sounds? gloves? speaker configurations? Really...Cashcow

5386,"CSGO is a very enjoyable skill-based game that can keep you engrossed for a long time.  The essential thrill from this game comes from the competitive mode along with friends which can only be explained through its actual experience.  CSGO has a variety of maps, controls, and skills to learn.  In my experience, these prerequisite steps into the the immersive world of CSGO takes around 100 hours at most.  On the other hand, mastering the game will require an abundance of hark work; the game has a very high-skill ceiling for the competitive skill-level varies vastly in the community.  Mastering takes impeccable aim, game sense, reaction time, and teamwork.  Thankfully, there are hundreds of innovative community servers that can help you reach these heights.
   
Secondly, the game has an interesting skin mechanic by which users can alter the semblance of their own guns.  My personal favorites are the Marble Fade, Hyper Beast and Bloodsport artistic design.  The main criticism of CSGO is perhaps the need for a better developed VAC (Valve Anti-Cheat System) ban system because hacks such as Aimbot, wall hacks, and Triggerbot can ruin the whole experience of a competitive game.  Overall, CSGO is, compared to other FPS games, unique because it is packed with many different features and excitement, so I would definitely anyone recommend to try this game out.",True

5392,"Me and first person shooters have had a love hate relationship for a very long time, starting out on halo and competing in a few tourneys in it started my descent into it, though after Halo 3's release I felt sort of let down by the genre, attempting to move over to the Call of Duty franchise left me feeling bored with easy gameplay, and constant hands grabbing at my wallet which made me leave FPS in general
Then a few months ago I build my first PC
looking around during the steam sale for stuff I found the Valve complete pack which had L4D2 and Portal, which I knew and love, aswell as half life which I had yet to try
one night when bored I noticed this game in my library and was like, hmmm I wonder what this is
I have not returned from that moment, this game has had me so in love, more so then my early days in Halo
it is proof for me that graphic fidelity is not the be all end all, the mechanics in this game make it one of the most intense games I have ever played
that moment where you start defusing, you hear someone behind you and turn and get that quick lucky headshot, then turn back and start defusing again, as the beeping gets faster and you feel your heart racing hoping that you dont see that green light that marks your demise
No matter how many times I have had this moment it has not lost a cent of its love and intensity from me
As I said earlier it is not the most visually pleasing, if your looking for over the top visuals, go elsewhere
however if you want a well constructed game that runs silky smooth on 90% of machines, and will challenge you to get better.
A game where Skill conquers nearly all besides raw luck on rare occasions
a game that you dont just pick your favorite gun and keep spawning in with it, where each round your paying to get that gun off of your past performance from the last rounds, and you have to decide, do I just not buy anything or do I get a sub par gun in an attempt to get some real kills
CS GO forces you to think smart
you cant just walk and spray in a straight line, there is recoil, and there are true tactics here that cater to the well prepared and well coordinated
there are also casual modes, which I have little interest in, I play them when I havent played in a few days and want to get myself back in gear before moving back into Competitive
I really do enjoy the community market place on here, I have spent way to much on gun skins, but there is absolutely no pressure to buy anything, however I feel its nice to have a gun and name it once in a while and be like ""THIS, this is mine""
I hope more people get in on this game, especially at this price there is almost no reason not too, I have sold guns on this game for over $60 which then got me a whole bunch of other cheaper gun skins and a game or two

Once you learn how to play properly like control ur recoil with every gun and things like that, you might find it hard to stop playing the game and not get addicted :D. I think it's a great game because it has great maps and Dust II is my favourite by far, however the maps aren't exactly balanced I would say. The game is quite funny at times and there is proof in some of my screenshots :D. The only reason why I don't give it 10/10 is because it's not exactly balanced with the maps. The maps have like different camp areas for each team and some areas are better and things like that, bomb spots, hiding spots, etc. But, apart from that, this game has made me play 1500 hours already and I think I've only been playing for a year!

This game is all about personal progression, since it comes with a high learning curve, it's not about unlocking some stupid grip or scope for your gun. It's about you, that has to learn.

The game is updated almost once a week with new features and content, Match Making is great when you are playing with friends.

The real game for people that love to play competitively, with a team or just solo.

There are also casual game modes available for the people that don't like to play competitively, such as Arms Race, Deathmatch, Hostage and Defusual missions which can be played on casual style, or mostly known as public or community servers. These modes are great to learn the game, and improve your play.


Pros.
◘ Match Making.
◘ Skill levels and ranks, play against players of your own skill level.
◘ Competitive scene, with ladders and tournaments.
◘ The CS feeling, transition from older CS games to CS:GO isn't that hard.
◘ Most old maps from CS, are in the game.
◘ No perks and other unnecessary clutter.
◘ Great spectator sport, easily to understand and interesting to watch!
◘ No pay to win model, all items are purely cosmetic.


Cons.
◘ Match Making 64 tick servers stability could be improved.
◘ Game could use some optimization here and there.
◘ Cheaters now and then, but that's online gaming for you.
◘ RiP Desert Eagle, as we once knew it.",True
5401,"[h1]Alright Little late *cough* BUT a review Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, and the entire Counterstrike series are amazing games it combines infinite user designed maps on custom servers for extreme amounts of fun, if you are not already interested in the competive mode the bare skin and bones of any counterstrike game to date. It is the core game inside this game that makes it so fun. The reason it it so fun is that urge to get better to be the best. Counter Strike is a game where you can always be better and there is always room for improvement and it is that skill and randomness of skill in the games even global elites the highest rank in the game. Can play like the lowest rank if they dont practice for say 3 months. It is that that makes Counter-Strike The game it is. Why we sink so many hours into the game. And why it is our favorite game. It is not for everyone... But it is for those people who strive to do better be the best and have a fun time with friends, through losses, and great victory...

There is no CS player that never raged because of this game it could be because of a hacker, a little kid yelling in the mic or because you suck and you just want to blame your team.
But it also has it's glory moments like getting that 360 no scope or clutching for your team.
CS can be like a drug once you start you can't stop because once you feel that adrenalin rush when you clutch 1v5 and win for your team you will just want more and more and more.

[h1]The Good Stuff[/h1]
++An FPS where strategy is key, a nice difference away from other FPS games like Call of Duty
++This game is played professionally for millions of dollars, so it's just a tad popular. Just a tad. 
+Multiple gamemodes, for those that are competitive, casual or play solo
+Graffiti is fun, you get quite a few drops of those
+Maps are balanced for all gamemodes providing fair play 
+Most maps, skins and stickers are created by the community on the Steam Workshop
+Just as good as the old Counter Strike games, just better graphics and better gameplay
+Updates often, for bugs and content

[h1]The Ok Stuff[/h1]
=The ranking system seems a bit off, as you have to win a solid 6 to 8 games, all of which you have to do good in to rank up and then simply lose 2 or 3 games and derank
=Sprays and sounds for guns change frequently
=This goes for any multiplayer game with a huge community... some people are toxic

[h1]The Bad Stuff[/h1]
-Gamethrowers, Derankers, Squeakers, Wallers, Spinbotters, Aimhackers and Smurfs. I have been in a game with all of them. 
-All Community Market items are scammy and pointless. I have like $5 to $10 worth of skins in my inventory but buying cases and opening costs $2.50 whereas most skins are simply 5 cents. Buy in game items off the market, don't open cases or capsules
-CS:GO Gambling sites (Which have basically died off due to multiple scams by YouTubers and other VIPs)

5471,"[h1]Hello! After 1132 hours, let me speak about this game.[/h1]
Firstly you shouldn't install the game if you don't have any patience and luck or if you can't speak English. Sorry but, it's a team game, not a singleplayer game. Don't trust your aim that much, you could do something with AWP when your team is eco. But until high ranks. You should watch your team's economy. I was playing solo queue until I become LE rank and saw some people didn't ask for a drop when I got way too money. I actually like Russian people and was trying to learn a few words from Russian. But of course, I had toxic teammates. Don't just be racist to Turkish or Russian people, please. Even English people are been toxic, flamer at us. This game has a really bad matchmaking system at all. My teammates were playing like NOVAs and enemies were playing like it's FPL match. Yesterday I one tapped one guy so hard and he said ""its hacker vs hacker now"" it was sad. Sometimes it is satisfying to be called a hacker. CSGO in general, can't beat CS 1.6 or CS:S. I played CS 1.6 since 2007. Yeah CSGO has awesome graphics but, it doesn't have CS:S or CS 1.6's awesome people. Only OG players play the old games. 

[h1]About Skins:[/h1] I used to bet in May 2017 a lot. I made a profit from 30$ to 260$ by small steps. Then I lost them all on 19 May. Then I paid 20$ again and lost all. After that Hydra Operation came out. I sold my TF2 inventory in the summertime to buy new CSGO skins in 2017. I changed my knife a lot. Besides the knife, I got 100$ CSGO inventory. I wanted to have a profit again in January 2018. I played coinflips. I won a few skins and lost all of my skins again. But I didn't play it with my knife. I had to sell my last knife to buy a new laptop. My total lost is 360$. I want to gather it again. I have 170$ CSGO inventory now. I'll never ever play bets or coinflips.

[h1]About CSGO's Esport:[/h1] As you know, I was betting in 2017 May. I used to follow esport matches at all. love Gambit, Immortals, Space Soldiers, Virtus Pro and I hated [i]Dignitas, LDLC, Immortals, SK.[/i] Probably of their matches but. I'm still following the HLTV forums. I didn't bet for ages. But I like to watch it now. I learn a lot of things. You should watch professional matches too. I like [i]Mouseports and Natus Vincere[/i] now. I like [i]Astralis[/i] team and their tactics but, they're getting old. Probably [i]Natus Vincere[/i] will try hard and win the [i]ESL One Rio Major 2020[/i]. I hope I'll find a friend who follows those things. I'm a fan of [i]s1mple[/i]. Not because he is good awper, besides he is a good awper, he has a really good personality. We can discuss whatever you want whenever you want about CSGO Esports. I know every team's history. I know every clip that shakes the world or troll things that professional players do.

[h1]About my Rank:[/h1] My wingman rank is [b]""Global Elite""[/b] and my competitive rank is [b]""Distinguished Master Guardian""[/b]. I was trying to be LE by playing it solo queue but as I said, people are weird. You should play the game with friends who have decent aim and game sense. I had one by one lose or win.

[i]I'll leave the game for 4 months. Don't worry, I'll come back for Major Pick'ems :p. But I won't sell my skins or leave it forever. I have to study. Thank you for reading all of those! [/i]",True

5480,"I've played cs go for a few years now. A lot is already said so I won't repeat myself.

I love cs go. It's high learnign curve and depth is something that's still incredibly fun. The only thing I wish was that the community was more friendly. I understand that this is a part of being in such a competitive community but I think it would be so much more fun if people wouldn't be so hostile and actually tried to help eachother more and just have fun.

Someone does or say something that's annoying just let it be. It's just sad that everyone goes into a fit over something small. What's even worse is that you could end up in a fight with one person on the other team and the next match he might be on yours.

There's no reason to be on the level of hostility that some people are and for no real reason. It's a shame, but luckily you end up with a nice group sometimes and communicate and joke around.

I used to play with my clan mates but they're all in their own group now, so I'm left having to solo-Q. Find some friends to play with, the game gets a lot more fun when you do. :)",True
5481,"What's bad about this game.

-Pistols shouldn't be able to one tap at any range by the exception of the R8 and Desert Eagle, they should do 91 damage at best for a headshot, making SMGs/Shotguns a viable if not better option, making gameplay more varied and money actually something you care about, not just to buy pistol armor every single time you lose a round ffs.

-Dualies are underpowered and deserve more armor penetration, for being also the one actually having recoil, meaning skill.

-Tec9/5-7/Glock-18 have too many spare magazines and need to have just as much as the P2K. They also have ridiculous accuracy while moving so the price is LITERALLY because you have more ammo and better accuracy in contrast of a quick and cheaper alternative known as the P250.

-CZ-75 needs to be 300$ again and / or provide 300$, if neither of these, an extra magazine for how stupidly of a no brainer which is better in between 5-7/Tec9.

-R8 needs a kill reward of 300$ or more ammo, otherwise it's again a no brainer to choose over the Desert Eagle.

-AWP needs accuracy penalty just as big as the Desert Eagle when people jumps and land, no scopes should also never be in the middle of crosshair period, why is this even allowed, there should be scope sway pattern to compensate, gun is absolutely the easiest to use and a lot of people just end up in higher ranks because they can AWP, takes little to no skill and it turns every games into a AWPfest at any rank which is no fun, why can people EVEN push with those and be fully accurate while crab walking, it's a sniper rifle meant to watch over area's, not meant to push. It should share the same EXACT mechanics as the Auto snipers, slow and forever to be accurate with. Also, a lot of AWP shots aren't even on point and they connect. What else if not for those. Aim punch for having your eye down a scope perhaps? Just anything. The AWP is not balanced and breaks the game in anyone's hands. Only gets worst with good players.

-Jumping once with a Desert Eagle is commiting suicide, the accuracy penalty is ridiculus and honestly all weapons should suffer from the same the heavier they are, not just the Desert Eagle. Especially the AWP in particular.

-CT auto sniper rifle being superior to the T auto sniper. It makes no sense for the Scar to have a reload speed so short.

-In fact, everything should have accuracy penalty for jumping, not just some casual crosshair spread that instantly recover, this isn't Quake.

-Of course you can allow people to jump and shoot, but RNGesus always be on their favor, why even allow people to shoot while jumping as it makes it at luck based in a ""SKILL"" game, FIX PLEASE? Insurgency does it right by not allowing this crap.

-Why the hell is people allowed to jump at the same speed while getting tagged, but if you're running, tagging slows you down almost 100%? Hello Valve? Fix?

-SSG 08 is fully accurate at any state INCLUDING no scope, but jumping, (Unless at the peak of jump.) why is this even allowed? THE HELL. Either give weapons the same mechanics or effin don't, nobody should have to buy a specific weapon to benefit some counter productive advantages.

-AUG needs to have a longer if not the same lethal range as pistols. (And remember to remove that lethal range from pistols just wtf.) Without forgetting how stupidly long is the reload time, why is that? The weapon is good but not THAT good to make the reload time among the worst of all rifles. Why is it this way? 3.8 seconds? Why not something like 3.4 that wouldn't make you feel like the trigger is stuck after the animation finishes while you have 5 T's rushing you with AK's that take 2.5 seconds to reload or even the SG553 that's 2.8, make the extra investment be worth equally, not just in one segment of the statistics with a massive nerf! Buying something more expensive can justify some downsides but not something like that. It makes the gun completely worthless in where it should exceed, DEFENDING. CT's rifles can be worst because they are the one holding sites but when the highest tier doesn't have it's purpose. It's not right. Was that a typo or something? Was it because the AUG needed a nerf in the early versions and the gun was gimped to hell? Fix it properly where it makes sense. This 3.8 seconds reload time is too long and does not corelate to the small benefits it has over the M4's 3.1 seconds or even the 3.3 FAMAS which with less ammo can be understood. Christ, even the Scar-20 takes less with it's recycled M4 animations. The CT auto sniper should be the one to take longer like the G3SG1, not the AUG.

-Why is the Sawed-Off movement speed slow as hell, but the MAG-7 isn't? Why can't it cost the same 1800$ or slightly cheaper with the same running speed and pellet range? It's wider spread is already bad and just enough powerful to be useful. No range just makes it WORTHLESS, plus if you get tagged you're literally being STOPPED from moving, why even add the option?

-XM1014 has so LITTLE pellet, just why. You paid an extra to have an ""AUTO""shotgun variant of the lower tier, not an underpowered downgrade. The spread of pellets makes it almost impossible to hit anyone because there's barely enough to hit anything. Christ as if it's not enough to have cheap pistols that can 1 tap in the face, shotguns STRUGGLES to do that.

-Instant crouching is game breaking and should be slower like it used to be in old CS versions, it simply screws up detection, people shooting don't get that lighting fast crouch in their screen and end up dying thinking there's no reg when the stupid lag compensation can't follow that the guy crouching missed every single shoots until he crouched and messed up your own aim that was on point to his head, making you think you suck at the game when it's just flawed badly. Just notice how everyone or even yourself do it and end up winning gun fights JUST because of that, server side just can't HANDLE it.

-Why is the MP7 movement so SLOW, you pay an extra for reliability that you can MOVE and SHOOT, it's an SMG. It defeats the purpose of it, making the MP9/MAC-10 and UMP-45 a better yet CHEAPER choice. Even the P90 runs faster, just why.

-PP-Bizon? Perhaps if it did have armor penetration as equal the MP9 it would ACTUALLY be worth paying the ""EXTRA"" for since EVERYTHING else again is a better option because it's a GOOD idea to make lower tier weapons superior to it, right Valve?

-USP-S is just like the M4A1-S are stupidly accurate on the move, because you have a silencer doesn't mean you'll be more accurate while RUNNING it's just unfair, I don't see why CT's can run back while shooting and tap you in the head while despite your effort standing still tapping slowly with a Glock-18 to someone's head none of your shots hit and if they do, they have a chance to survive.

The goods? Would be perfectly fun if all of the above was fixed. I can tolerate this crap, but I don't know how long I will, meta is dumb and everyone is mostly a scrub with an AWP, I can't improve anymore than that unless people actually have firefights with me which is the fun. I hate this meta because it ruins 75% of the content the game has to offer, strats and gameplay BARELY varies. It's always a terrible AWPfest of skybox smoke and flashes that you end up dying because some scrub can only use the same ONE BODYSHOT KILL weapon that has absolutely nothing needed to compensate and have to watch you coming in a VERY predictable position that despite your HARD efforts to jiggle peek and use of equipement, he will outgun you as soon as you try to engage him, while if he fails he can just run away until you are fortunate enough to have him miss a easy shot like all of the others.

VAC is also garbage.

5482,"It's another installment to the CS series and oh boy has it become a huge eSport title. I've always felt that Counter Strike was one of the pioneers of FPS Multiplayer shooters who did it just right. I often feel that Counter-Strike always had a better multiplayer than Call Of Duty. Of coarse, this is a subjective topic which I really don't need to talk about to be honest. A whole lot of new additions have been added to the franchise like the ranking system which sounds good in practice, but it's pretty broken if you ask me. Another addition to the franchise are weapon skins, which are of coarse extremely dumb, especially with the knives. Eventhough weapon skins are a little stupid, I still love using them in game. But out of all the things that they could've added to the game they had to add this. I mean come on! What happened the the moveable and interactive objects from back in the Counter-Strike: Source days? 

I mean those were the days, when you could actually strategically use barrels to your advantage, like hiding a bomb or blocking a passage in the doorway or something. Another nice thing is the graphics, I don't really bother that much.They are plain and simple (in a good way) compared to a game like COD, where you need to spend a bit to get enough money to play that game, let alone on the lowest settings at a decent framerate. Overall, I think this has to be in my top 10 most addicting games at the moment. CSGO is great (besides Xbox version) and is almost near perfect. I like playing games for the challenge and Counter-Strike is a worthy choice.",True

5498,"I have to say, originally, I did not want anything to do with this game. I have been a big fan of the series since starting with Beta 4 way back when. After CS:S was released, I was very content with the way the series had been progressing. The updated gameplay and graphics gave me a boosted interest in a game I had not played in several years. 

When Counter-Strike: Global Offensive was released, I was not feeling the same way. The frantic and well edited trailers made the game look spectacular, that is until I noticed it was still running on the source engine, albeit a modified version. Given the hefty price tag, I stayed away from CS:GO for as long as possible, until I noticed how many updates had been made since the first CS:GO beta, and the subsequent gold release. It was obvious, the developer planned on putting as much effort into maintaining the game as they were to keep the game fresh and even competitive. 

Once I finally bought the game on sale for a decent price, I realized what I had been missing. Competitive mode has changed the way the game feels and works. It was very easy to get bored playing CS:S, because as the popularity increased, so did the servers. Pretty soon you were competing against 32 players on the opposing team, making for a hellish free-for-all, despite the team based combat. CS:GO found the perfect solution by introducing a competitive game mode. Instead of having to play with your friends in 5v5 tournaments, CS:GO incorporated a 5v5 mode that mirrored the professional experience, making it a lot more fun to play. The fine-tuned competitive mode, coupled with officially supporting death match and the arsenal game modes, making CS:GO a game with a lot more re-playability, and a lot more fun.

Some people are critical about the inclusion of skins, turning CS:GO into Team Fortress 2, but they fail to recognize the importance of customization. The skins don't really impact the gameplay, and are not overly obnoxious like some of the content included in TF2. In addition to the developer created content, the inclusion of community created weapon skins and operations allow community members to profit while increasing the awareness and fun of the game. I am not a fan of DLC, especially since most DLC is lack-luster overpriced content that should have normally been included in the game at launch, but was separated out to pay-for downloadable content in the interest of pumping out sequels and printing money instead of focusing on quality. CS:GO however, chooses community content to include, and gives back to the authors who continue to breath life into the game.

Overall, I was skeptical when it was first released, but the developer's constant attention to detail and genuine intention to keep the game balanced and competitive has made this the best game in the series. I highly recommend fans of the series update to CS:GO and enjoy themselves.",True

The weapons feel more versatile and there are less ""worthless"" weapons like there were before, in Source there were really only 5 or so acceptable guns but in GO, I find myself picking up many different weapons for different situations. The new maps are a welcome, I always thought the original lineup was rather limited (Note: there are a few maps from CS:S that did not make it into CS:GO, however, they are not really missed).

Well, yeah of course , they kick  you out if you don't do what you should do, if you're not listening or keep arguing with them, but once you practice more on bots/death match you will learn and get used of how to shot/kill/play and by the time, you will see that there is no sense to argue, just do what you should do and don't waste time.
Second point, yeah, there are good players, and smurfs but you can still play and have fun, why not? What's the matter...you win/lose you can still make friends,for example I played it 4 times and i got 3-4 friends already so that's not a matter.

5552,"CS:GO is a highly competitive skill-based game. This is what makes it so great, learning the maps, all of the different tactics, improving your aim and managing the economy. This however, can be a long grind. Every map has its own calls, grenade spots to learn and positions to play.

CS:GO runs great(although every updates costs FPS), has some good sound design, and decent graphics for an older game. Updates come regularly to add stuff and valve keeps improving the game. A big downside of CS:GO however is the big amount of cheaters. If you don't link your phone number to the game and play in ""prime-matchmaking"" the game can be literally unplayable. This can be very frustrating, especially when you're doing your best to rank up and improve. 

Aim and sound play an important role in CS:GO, More than in most other shooters. every gun has it's own recoil pattern to learn and it's own unique playstyle. Since CS:GO requires alot more tactics than most other shooters, aim is more important aswell. Having your crosshair at the right position means you can take your opponent down alot faster. Alot of practice, and playing aim maps helps and using your sound to locate your enemy's footsteps gives you a big advantage. The CS:GO Esports scene is also massive, milions of people follow it and it's a great place to learn. Use this to your advantage. Wanna know those new tactics, boosts and smoke/flashes? Watch some games! You can honestly learn alot from watching the pro's play. 

Now ofcourse, you saw this one coming, the community can be really... annoying. Especially at lower ranks the community is full of toxic kids, people who have no idea what they are doing and teammates who refuse to work together. This can be harsh, especially because CS:GO heavily relies on teamwork. Thats why i recommend playing this game with friends, and practicing alot. The faster you're out of those low ranks the better! Once you get a bit higher you'll see the community gets better and better(with the occasional toxic/clueless player ofcourse). People work together, people give usefull information and are just a bit more nice in general.

Next to competitive, CS:GO also has some gamemodes for people who just want to have some fun and don't care about ranks or tactics. Gamemmodes like: Gun-Game, Team Deathmatch and Casual are great for this and the thousands of community servers offer cool things like: Surfing, Aim training, roleplay, minigames and more!

Now would i recommend CS:GO? Yea ofcourse! Especially for the small amount of money it costs. Just dont expect this to be another casual shooter. It's a highly skilled game and requires you to put in alot of time to improve. Pick this up with a couple of friends so there is less chance to be matched with annoying teammates.",True

Have no idea why am I still playing after 500h but I'd still recommend the game to a friend(the one I hate).

5577,"Counter-Strike Global Offensive is a Tactical Team Based FPS that is loads of fun if you're willing to put your time towards it.

I've been playing this game since release in 2012, and it has brought me some of the most memorable moments in my life. While I agree the game is difficult at the start, the satisfying feeling of winning and getting to the top is incredible. The rush of the gameplay always has me coming back for more, even with 2000+ hours in the game.

This game is like an abusive husband. You hate it, but at the same time you love it and you keep coming back for more.

This is my 3rd time editing my review, and I can still say that I highly recommend this game.

Grab your friends, control your sanity, and game on. For $15, this game is a steal.",True
5578,"As someone who grew up with the old CS, this is definitely a great pastime. Now with better graphics and more chickens.",True
5579,"Death is a great teacher. Failure in Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is, as it always has been for this series, the greatest way to learn where you should have gone, what you shouldn't have done, and how you could have done better. Counter-Strike players spend a lot of time learning -- consequently, they are always getting better.

Growth is an important factor in Global Offensive, especially if you're coming into Counter-Strike fresh or after a sabbatical. This is an extremely hardcore, skill-based first-person shooter, and it forces you to think differently than other modern shooters. If you’re a Call of Duty player, you’re going to need to change your play style to succeed here. Counter-Strike also tries developing into something new here as well, despite doing little to push itself beyond what it’s always done best. Global Offensive modifies old maps to keep veterans on their toes, and introduces official new modes that encourage different play styles for the first time in almost 15 years.Pieces of the Counter-Strike formula are dated at this point, but the superb heart and soul of Global Offensive is timeless. Teams are small, guns are lethal, and rounds are short. There's an addictive just-one-more-round quality to it, because there's a constant desire to do better than last time, to earn a satisfying kill, or to win in a new way. Call of Duty and Battlefield vets will wonder why they can't sprint to escape enemy fire or look down the iron sights to improve aim; Counter-Strike players will feel like they walked into their redecorated home. Certain map redesigns will catch hardcore fans off guard, but the changes are for the best -- the underpass choke point in de_dust, for instance, has a new escape route.

Even in the face of genre evolution, Global Offensive doesn’t care to adapt. CSGO is so dedicated to Counter-Strike's aging ideals despite market and trend changes that it brute-forces its way to success. Part of what makes it such an engaging competitive game is that killing in Global Offensive requires a wholly different skill set than other shooters. Everyone is limited to what they have and can see, with little room for character modification or on-the-fly advantages. Running and gunning is a useless play style, even if you've bought a helmet and kevlar that round, to the point that someone standing still is more likely to score the kill. Walking, crouching, or standing are your best bets to reduce the inaccurate spray of machine-gun fire.Consequently, killing in Global Offensive feels good. There's a sickening sensation to dropping someone dead because you know they're not coming back. It's also satisfying knowing you used limited resources to play smarter than your victim. If players aren't watching corners, providing covering fire, or using smoke grenades and flashbangs, they're more likely to take a headshot from a more delicate and patient triggerman. The desire to experience that distinct feeling is a strong motivator to keep playing, even when you're getting steamrolled by an obviously better team.

If you've played Counter-Strike before, Global Offensive probably sounds a whole lot like Counter-Strike. Like Counter-Strike: Source before it, Global Offensive exists simply to modernize the look of the classic competitive shooter, while doing little to disrupt the core form and function. At the same time, it does enough to color outside the lines of tradition to justify your time and effort.Fire is one of the most interesting new combat variables. Molotov cocktails and incendiary grenades either roast groups of guys or force them in another direction. Flames are a useful distraction or scare tactic, too. They're particularly useful during Demolition matches, which focus the fight at a single bomb site rather than giving terrorists two to pick between. The new and modified maps in this mode aren't as big as classic Counter-Strike arenas – entire sections have been cut off to direct teams toward a central location – but their thoughtful design is as intricate as ever. The Lake map is a standout -- there's a wide open yet densely populated yard around the bomb site, which is inside a sizable lakeside home with plenty of vantage points and hiding spots. To separate Demolition from Defusal, players can't buy between rounds. Instead, it takes a cue from the other new mode, Arms Race, in which each kill unlocks another weapon instantly. The better you do, the more you have to switch up the way you play, and because Demolition is so fast you'll need to be quick on your feet.Unlike other game types, Arms Race allows for respawns. It's the most chaotic and care-free mode in Global Offensive, with players throwing caution to the wind for the sake of climbing the kill ladder as quickly as possible. It's a shame there are only two maps in Arms Race -- a problem that will more likely persist on consoles than PC.

If you have the option, playing the PC version is unquestionably the best way to experience Counter-Strike: Global Offensive. Mods, mouse and keyboard, and the usual PC-only options are better than the ports. Plus, Valve is much better about long-term PC support -- it abandoned Team Fortress 2 on consoles, and Portal 2's level editor was PC exclusive. If you prefer to play on consoles, Global Offensive is the same great game, with the following special bits: 

PlayStation 3
For those who want to play on PlayStation 3 but don’t want to deal with the imprecision of analog sticks, Counter-Strike: GO supports mouse and keyboard, giving it a pretty noticeable edge over the Xbox 360 version. If you’re feeling saucy, Move is another option, although nuance dies with the motion controller. Move is accurate, and your quick reflexes will score kills, but the unavoidable instability of holding a remote will give your cursor some seriously unpleasant wobble. Worse, moving the wand quickly can confuse the controller, which often and irritatingly misinterprets basic left/right looks as a want to turn around 180 degrees.

Xbox 360
Aside from the lack of keyboard/mouse input, the Xbox 360 version of Global Offensive is functionally identical to that on PS3 -- the new radial user-interface on both platforms is as elegant as it is on PC. Because it’s a hardcore competitive game, Counter-Strike blocks party chat in an effort to combat cheating, forcing players with headsets to play with friends or brave the Wild West of obscenity that is Xbox Live.

The Verdict
Global Offensive is definitely a Counter-Strike sequel -- it looks and feels familiar, with minor tweaks here and there to help balance old issues and surprise longtime players. This is a demanding, skill-based multiplayer game that's as satisfying now as it ever was, but it's for a specific kind of player. If you're not willing to learn to play different than you're used to, look elsewhere. Otherwise, this is a top-tier tactics game that will probably share the long-tailed legacy of its predecessors.

No matter what new fps games I try this one keeps pulling me back because of the feel of the game, its smooth, feels snappy to respond unlike all other shooters and rewards good play and team work. 

Lacking a bit on the casual game modes, but the Danger Zone game mode is one of my favourite battle royales out there because games take ~5-10 minutes and feels fast paced. Also you will quite frequently face smurfs and cheaters, where facing better players can be over come by working a team which drives competitiveness for me unlike all else. The cheaters are far too common and would love to see Valve do something about them, for now Faceit seems to be a good way to avoid most of them but shouldn't be the requirement to do so.

5622,"""Anger"": an intense emotional response. Often it indicates when one's basic boundaries are violated. Some have a learned tendency to react to anger through retaliation. Anger may be utilized effectively by setting boundaries or escaping from dangerous situations. Sheila Videbeck describes anger as a normal emotion that involves a strong uncomfortable and emotional response to a perceived provocation.[1] Raymond Novaco of UC Irvine, who since 1975 has published a plethora of literature on the subject, stratified anger into three modalities: cognitive (appraisals), somatic-affective (tension and agitations), and behavioral (withdrawal and antagonism).[2] William DeFoore, an anger-management writer, described anger as a pressure cooker: we can only apply pressure against our anger for a certain amount of time until it explodes.[3]

Anger may have physical correlates such as increased heart rate, blood pressure, and levels of adrenaline and noradrenaline.[4] Some view anger as an emotion which triggers part of the fight or flight brain response.[5] Anger becomes the predominant feeling behaviorally, cognitively, and physiologically when a person makes the conscious choice to take action to immediately stop the threatening behavior of another outside force.[6] The English term originally comes from the term anger of Old Norse language.[7] Anger can have many physical and mental consequences.

The external expression of anger can be found in facial expressions, body language, physiological responses, and at times in public acts of aggression.[8] Animals, for example, make loud sounds, attempt to look physically larger, bare their teeth, and stare.[9] The behaviors associated with anger are designed to warn aggressors to stop their threatening behavior. Rarely does a physical altercation occur without the prior expression of anger by at least one of the participants.[9] While most of those who experience anger explain its arousal as a result of ""what has happened to them,"" psychologists point out that an angry person can very well be mistaken because anger causes a loss in self-monitoring capacity and objective observability.[10]

Modern psychologists view anger as a primary, natural, and mature emotion experienced by virtually all humans at times, and as something that has functional value for survival. Anger can mobilize psychological resources for corrective action. Uncontrolled anger can, however, negatively affect personal or social well-being.[10][11] While many philosophers and writers have warned against the spontaneous and uncontrolled fits of anger, there has been disagreement over the intrinsic value of anger.[12] The issue of dealing with anger has been written about since the times of the earliest philosophers, but modern psychologists, in contrast to earlier writers, have also pointed out the possible harmful effects of suppressing anger.[12] Displays of anger can be used as a manipulation strategy for social influence.[13][14]

Psychology and sociology[edit]

The Anger of Achilles, by Giovanni Battista Tiepolo depicts the Greek hero attacking Agamemnon.
Three types of anger are recognized by psychologists: The first form of anger, named ""hasty and sudden anger"" by Joseph Butler, an 18th-century English bishop, is connected to the impulse for self-preservation. It is shared between humans and non-human animals and occurs when tormented or trapped. The second type of anger is named ""settled and deliberate"" anger and is a reaction to perceived deliberate harm or unfair treatment by others. These two forms of anger are episodic. The third type of anger is called dispositional and is related more to character traits than to instincts or cognitions. Irritability, sullenness and churlishness are examples of the last form of anger.[15]

Anger can potentially mobilize psychological resources and boost determination toward correction of wrong behaviors, promotion of social justice, communication of negative sentiment and redress of grievances. It can also facilitate patience. In contrast, anger can be destructive when it does not find its appropriate outlet in expression. Anger, in its strong form, impairs one's ability to process information and to exert cognitive control over their behavior. An angry person may lose his/her objectivity, empathy, prudence or thoughtfulness and may cause harm to others.[10][16][17] There is a sharp distinction between anger and aggression (verbal or physical, direct or indirect) even though they mutually influence each other. While anger can activate aggression or increase its probability or intensity, it is neither a necessary nor a sufficient condition for aggression.[10]

Afferent development[edit]
Extension of the Stimuli of the Fighting Reactions. At the beginning of life the human infant struggles indiscriminately against any restraining force, whether it be another human being or a blanket which confines his movements. There is no inherited susceptibility to social stimuli, as distinct from other stimulation, in anger. At a later date the child learns that certain actions, such as striking, scolding, and screaming, are effective toward persons, but not toward things. In adults, although the infantile response is still sometimes seen, the fighting reaction becomes fairly well limited to stimuli whose hurting or restraining influence can be thrown off by physical violence.[18]

Rage[edit]
The words annoyance and rage are often imagined to be at opposite ends of an emotional continuum: mild irritation and annoyance at the low end and fury or murderous rage at the high end. Rage problems are conceptualized as ""the inability to process emotions or life's experiences""[19] either because the capacity to regulate emotion (Schore, 1994)[20] has never been sufficiently developed or because it has been temporarily lost due to more recent trauma. Rage is understood as ""a whole load of different feelings trying to get out at once"" (Harvey, 2004)[21] or as raw, undifferentiated emotions, that spill out when another life event that cannot be processed, no matter how trivial, puts more stress on the organism than it can bear.

5680,"CS:GO is without a doubt my favorite game in my steam library! It offers hour after hour of fun. Personally as a person that owns Call of Duty Ghost and BF4 I can easily say this game beats them. 5 different game modes, tons of unique maps just make it better! One aspect of this game that I dislike is skins. I have to confess that I have spent around  50 bucks on cases and that I have not made any profit yet. At first it is hard to start of because it is harder than CoD and BF but eventually you will get the hang of it!

Pros +
+hours of fun gameplay
+buyable add ons that add missions and easy ways to get skins
+the concept of skins
+fair game
+balanced weapons
+efficient money system

5700,"--------------------------------------My CS:GO review---------------------
Oh CS:GO, how much you've changed. When I first Pre-ordered the game I thought ""Man, another one in the series. I bet this is going to be the BEST! 
And so I was right. 1st day it came out: Played it. Won my first round myself. I still rememeber the feedback I got, ""Game came out and someone has already skilled it."" Oh the wonderful comments.
But, something happened. I started leaving it. I don't know why!?
Then, I wouldn't read what gamemode I was playing, started leaving, getting a cooldown, not caring. 

And now up to this point, I've reached a 7 day everytime.
Then I started leaving the game again. 2 days, 4 days etc.
I've left it for sooooo long, I finally came back when Chroma case came out. Now I go back to find the game not like it used to be. Screaming gamers. 12 year olds 'getting the game because they wanted to be cool'. Salty Casual people who rage at everything. And last but not least. Unboxing. I knew it would happen. Just like TF2 (Which is already ruined with hats and miscs and crates). The game I used to know has been ruined. People buying crates, unboxing, selling,skins, they run the place. Now, I'm here with people thinking there better then anyone. Now, of course I've fallen within that catergory, I've unboxed, bought skins and I feel guilty that the, happy, excited, me has fallen within this pathetic part of CS:GO. 


However, I still like the game, gamers still try to be the very best like no-one ever was. Others want to play for fun. Others want to be rich or make subscribers out of unboxing. I respect that. But, it annoys me how this is becoming a thing with 'MOST' Popular Valve Games, (not hl2). Now, all the people who dislike this review, I don't mind. People who likes this review agrees with me. I honestly don't want to have a fight in the comment section. So, I give this a. Thumbs Up. Because the gaming community can get better if we stop buying skins and just appreciate what a wonderful game is under there if we stop raging,unboxing,caring about trading. And look within what a awesome Game this was back when it came out.

5706,"Counter-Strike's newborn.

Weapon handling and Movement are nearly perfect.
No Aiming down Sights (besides the Sniperrifles) and really hard Recoil/Bulletspread that you can learn to control.
It has a hard learning curve but after some time you can get the hang of it.

The competitve Matchmaking is really easy to use and you get most of the time people who are in your skill group. After 10 competitive wins you get thrown into a skillgroup. Now you can rank up or get downranked, depends on your skill ingame.

CSGO still gets updated regularly and if you ignore all the cosmetics and questionable accounts you can still have good fun with your friends. Don't take it to serious and have fun.

You can collect Skins for you weapons. They don't have a advantage. There are some skins called Stattrak that you can just get through opening cases with a key. They have a little killcounter on the weapon that well, count your kills that you made with that weapon. Cases can drop , just like skins, after a match. (BUT NO AFTER EVERY MATCH AND THERE IS A DROP LIMIT PER WEEK!) If you really want a fancy dandy skin or a special knife(rarest thing you can get) you can either gamble and open cases with bought keys, buy your favourite skins on the Steam market or use the trade-up contract. With the contract (that you can find in your Global offensive inventory ingame) you can trade 10 weapons from one collection for a new better quality weapon from that collection.",True

5722,"What is Counter-Strike: Global Offensive?

Quite possibly one of the biggest and most popular first-person shooters of all time! Originating from Counter-Strike and Counter-Strike: Source, Counter-Strike: Global Offensive brings back familiar gameplay with improved visuals and mechanics. There are 5 main gamemodes.

[h1][u]Deathmatch[/u][/h1]

Deathmatch is a skirmish where you can practice with various weapons. In deathmatch, you instantly respawn after dying, with the main goal being to have the most points. You are given ""Bonus weapon"" prompts which give you more points for killing enemies. There is a spawn protection system which grants you and your enemies ~10 seconds to move/shoot before they become vulnerable again.

[h1][u]Arms Race[/u][/h1]

Arms Race, similar to Deathmatch, is a quick skirmish among 2 teams. the main goal is to be the first one to get a kill with every weapon and kill someone with the golden knife. A counter-measure to prevent the person in the lead to easily win makes that person visible to other players through walls, disallowing 1/2 players to easily win the game and allowing everyone a chance to get to the top.

[h1][u]Demolition[/u][/h1]

Demolition is a toned-down version of the classic Counter-Strike gameplay. The main goal is to eliminate the enemy team or to plant and detonate/defuse the bomb.There are two teams of 5 with 1 bombsite. Weapons are granted by achieving at least 1 kill in the round. Gaining more than 1 kill grants a grenade. This is a great gamemode to start learning the fundamentals of the main game.

[h1][u]Casual[/u][/h1]

This [i]is[/i] Counter-Strike. 10v10 lobbies of player-voted maps with 2 bombsites/hostages. The main goal is to eliminate the enemy team or plant and detonate/defuse the bomb. You can buy various rifles, pistols, SMGs, shotguns, machine guns, and grenades. You gain money to buy weapons from getting kills, completing objectives, and winning/losing the round.

[h1][u]Competitive[/u][/h1]

Competitive mode is considered, by some, what Counter-Strike is and only is - 5v5 teams with friendly fire enabled, best of 16, and knowledge of your weapons, teamwork, and money-management. In this mode, the stakes are high. You'll need to execute everything you know about the game. Recoil patterns, grenade spots, communication, game sense, and more. After winning 10 competitive matches, you are placed in a ranked skill group from which you will then play with people of similar ranks.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
[h1][u]NOTE: This next section talks specifically about the community; not the game itself![/u][/h1]

In addition to all these 5 main modes, there's also an option that allows you to join community-made servers. These servers are run by fellow Counter-Strike players. Popular gamemodes on these servers include scoutzknivez, 1v1 Arena, Mini-games, Jail-Break, and more.

However, Counter-Strike is notorious for having one of the best and the worst communities in a videogame.

On one side you have those who are truly enthusiastic about the game, wanting to improve their skills, help others improve theirs, host servers, and more. Some actively talk about not just the game, but the impact it has on the Esports scene.

On the other side, you have trolls, scammers, phishers, racists, the list goes on! Some are known to actively bet on professional matches and do some questionable and dangerous actions when they lose.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
[h1][u]Conclusion[/u][/h1]

Despite all these ups and downs, I can, without a doubt completely recommend this game. It has addictive, yet, simple gameplay; an active community, an amazing Esports following, and more!

Sometimes you'll meet some people who you'll still talk to for years to come, sometimes you'll meet people who make you want to quit playing Counter-Strike, but no matter what happens just remember -

[h1][b]Good luck, have fun![/b][/h1]",True

5765,"So a good friend bought this game for me, and after playing it a month(~70 hours) I'm completely hooked. I'm not that good at it, after the update with the new rankings I'm Gold Nova Master, but I love playing it, even though I mostly play with MG2 or MG1 players, because I mainly play in a full team with my friends.

The graphics are good enough, they would work on a potato. The sound it realistic, especially if you have a 7.1 sound system like I do. The only problem I have with the game after a month is the matchmaking system, and its many many foils. My team mostly gets matched with MG1 or MG2 players, who play like they are basically gods, that means they either cheat or are smurfs. 

Other than the funny matchmaking and the odd troll who makes you wanna just turn off the voice chat the game is seriously the best multiplayer game I've played in a long time. I had to get used to having no iron sights, because I've played a shit load of other multiplayer games, and I had to get used to the completely unrealistic spray patterns, but other than that this game is the ultimate multiplayer experience.

Yes I said ULTIMATE, because:
1. People will play it for years to come (not like Evolve, Titan Fall...) 
2. It's being constantly updated with new stuff.
3. It has skins (f**k you skins ;))
4. It's 10€(5€ when on sale) and for 10€ you get more content than most 60€ multiplayer games.

Overall score: 9/10

It was Round 29, we had match point and the one kid went on a killing spree and got 4 of them, he kept screaming ""LET ME GET THE ACE."" I didn't know what that meant, and found the last guy and killed him.

5878,"Like the previous games in the series, Global Offensive is an objective-based multiplayer first-person shooter. Each player joins either the Terrorist or Counter-Terrorist team and attempts to complete objectives or eliminate the enemy team. The game operates in short rounds that end when all players on one side are dead or a team's objective is completed. For most game modes, once a player dies, they must wait until the round ends to respawn. Players purchase weapons and equipment at the beginning of every round with money awarded based on their performance. Completing objectives or killing enemies earns the player money while negative actions, like killing a teammate or hostage, takes money away from the player. In addition, when a round ends all players receive some amount of money, with players on the winning team receiving substantially more.

Counter Strike Global Offensive adds new weapons and equipment not seen in previous installments, most notably the firebomb for each side (Molotovs for Terrorists and incendiary grenades for Counter-Terrorists). These temporarily cover a small area in fire, dealing damage to anyone passing through.",True

Pros: It's fun. It's more serious than your average shooter, with spray patterns, carefully-thought-out-on-the-fly-tactics and whatnot and it needs you to keep your hand in on a regular basis. Not the prettiest to look at of it's kind, but it's nowhere near ugly and it makes up for that in other ways. Wide variety of maps - both original and fan made - to play on. Lots and lots of things to practice with, ranging from Bot matches to actual fan made training aids. Mechanics (such as the aforementioned spray patterns for each weapon) involved. EVERYthing needs to be thought out and practiced on - from PoE (points of entry) to how you're going to get best usage out of whatever weapon you are holding at the time, even to how you personalise your mouse settings! Even the training is fun (mostly). Possible to make (lots) of money playing this game (if you're lucky). Achievements are wide ranging - ranging from easy to damn near impossible without luckand they DO encourage you to play with different weapons, maps and styles. Medal system as well as rank. Mission based coins to purchase for extras.

Cons: Due to the way it's set up (with fair reson behind it), a noob can get lumped in with absolutely anyone in matches - which could pit you with: people around your level of ability, people WAAAY in advance of your level of ability and complete £#@&tards (strangely, the game never seems to put you in with people lower!!). Playing with people can mean you end up playing the same maps over and over and over again (which is good for learning, but can be a pain, especially if it's a map you don't particularly like) LOTS of training involved. A personal con (literally) for me is the money you have to spend to get keys to open chests. Not a lot, but it all adds up (and also increases your chances of finding a valuable weapon to sell for REAL £££'s!! Which sort of turns it into a Pro - dependant on viewpoint)


The cons could put a lot of people off, but let me just say this - I pretty much at fps's. I don't really play them much and even then they tend to be things like the bioshock/half life/fallout/dead space type of shooters rather than your hardcore Call of Shouty or Battlerage (sorry for the dig, console peasants, mwahahah!) but if even I, pathetic as I may be at these games can have lots of fun, then the game must be doing something right.

If you love CoD and Bf to death, stick with those. If you fancy chancing your (shooting) arm on something a little more serious, OR, if you're an ARMA fan, why not give this a shot (pun intended). It'll either broaden your horizons, give you a bit of a challenge or be a nice diversion from your normal shooter of choice. Or all three, as is my case, old and crap as I am.

One last thing I will say is that this game has cracked time travel. I start at say around 9pm and then, after only a couple of matches, it's half past three in the a.m!! Also....  {that's TWO things!}

Two last things I will say, is that the game has cracked time travel and if you feel that things aren't going your way (i.e a bad round or two, or you can't find any enemy) then my advice is to take a 20-30min break - HOWEVER MUCH YOU DON'T WANT TO - trust me, it helps!",True

5947,"For those of you who're new to the Counter Strike series, this game has been around longer then any Battlefield or Call of Duty game. Most commonly known to now as CS:GO, this game has been around since 2012 and the previous one, Counter Strike: Source since 2004.

Counter Strike Global Offensive features a sufficient amount of gamemodes such as Demolition, Hostage and Defuse missions which actually require teamwork and co-orindation to win. CS:GO has its very own competitive play system which you're placed into a 5v5 match of people the same skill level as you (which is determined by your ranking on official VAC Secured servers) to fight it out on a gamemode and map of your choice. 

This game isn't for people who like to give up easily, it required skill in knowing the maps, how to handle recoil and working as a team to achieve victory. I'd highly recommend this game to anyone who's looking for a challenge in FPS shooters.",True
5948,"CSGO is a cultural icon, it is valve doing what valve does best; making timeless classics. The game has a good formula i.e. it is easy to get into but difficult to master and this constant need to master the game is what keeps you going. The game is no stranger to criticism or bugs of which I will cover in this review.

The new inclusion of battle royale and change to a free to play model is quite welcoming actually despite the large community backlash. I like to think of this update as WarOwl said in a recent YouTube video; CSGO is like a water park, you have your Olympic sized pool for all the grownups (competitive classic CSGO experience in this case) however you also have to cater for the kids with some cool visually good-looking water slides (Batlle royale in this case). It’s not like Valve is forcing you to play the BR mode, and to be honest it will never replace classic CSGO competitive, it’s just a bit of differentiation. The mode from first impressions seems good with it’s classic CS gunplay incorporated, however it is quite concerning that your fps currently drops significantly when playing this so maybe consider lowering your in game graphics.

The change to free to play is a bit questionable on the hand. Due to the influx of players and no need for a monetary investment there will be more cheaters and I am unsure if valve has the best anticheat to stop this. I however think that most cheating will happen on non-prime due to the grind that’s still there to get to level 21 and get prime status. From a personal experience so far I haven’t encountered a cheater actually in over 3 months (maybe because I’m Legendary eagle?) which is a great improvement however with the large influx of players I am unsure what will happen, I guess we have to wait and see.

People say this is a dead game, all over forums and game sites you’ll see people complaining that valve shows no love for the game and that its support is lacklustre compared to the likes of dota 2. This is true to an extent; sure, valve isn’t updating CSGO every month with new revolutionary game changing mechanics because they tried this with the r8 revolver update and various nerfs to which the community responded with fierce criticism. Truth be told valve has made a surprisingly balanced game and making and huge changes will drastically affect the classic counter strike gameplay we as players have come to expect. Some guns can be broken such as the one hit potential of the awp and ak47, and at first you would think that you can never reach that level but with a little practise you’ll realise that you were flaming over your opponents for no reason.

The player base can be disappointing at times. I would highly recommend making friends on this game as it will drastically help you become a better player as solo queuing is a coin flip, some day you might get the best teammates you could have imagined for, other times you could be stuck with a team of people from all corners of Europe raging at who’s baiting who via their abomination of a microphone. Toxicity is a big problem with the game along with smurfing and frankly it’s just something you get used to, my advice is just to power through it, you will have some bad games but there is a shining beacon of global elite at the end.

From my review you’ll probably see all the criticisms and must think I’m crazy to recommend the game, to which I should agree however there is just something about this game, whenever I turn my PC on I instinctively boot up CSGO and next thing I know I’m in a game having fun just like that. I have over 1000 hours in the game which is dwarfed by the amounts some players have put in, you would think that’s more than enough time to bore someone of a game where you realistically play the same 7 maps and use the same 5 guns most of the time, but it doesn’t. I think it’s the fact that you can see yourself progressing as a better player, you will learn to spray, learn to clutch and gradually you’ll look back and have a sense of accomplishment which in turn activates a drive to play more and become even better.",True

5951,"Counter Strike is back, with CS: GO – Counter Strike: Global Offensive – the newest line in a decade of first person shooting games from Valve.

I must start off this article by saying that I first played CS (Counter Strike) when it was a beta. It was a mod for Half-Life that my friends and I loved playing on sweet 64MB Ram – 256MB of ram powered computers. Counter Strike, Day of Defeat (years later), EverQuest for them and Dark Age of Camelot for me. My childhood friends and I loved the games that we could get our hands on because they were all the best at the time. Sometimes we would spend our boring lunch hours as freshman in high school at Futureshop checking out the games we were going to buy and play. We played on DSL and cable connections and for the unfortunate of us that were still in internet yesterday – 56k dial-up lines. That’s when AOL was pumping out CD’s in the mail of free copies of their dial up software for every Tom, Dick, and Harry to use.

We were nerds in our very early years and you could say we were very young gamers. We did have computers but we had to get our parents to drive us to LAN parties most of the time. Sometimes, a group of us would ride our bicycles or walk to each persons house and help carry back computer components. We’re not just talking mouse and keyboard combinations. We’re talking giant 17-22″ CRT monitors that weighed 25 pounds or more.

I mention all this because back then we were just grateful to play video games. We felt a privilege that our parents didn’t know and probably would never know. We could become submersed into any fantasy world that we wanted and do whatever we chose. What was even better was that we could do it in an online environment with our like minded individuals. Or at least individuals with a common interest in that particular video game. It was amazing what we were able to do so we didn’t troll, we didn’t grief, we just played our games. When they became boring and we became overly skilled that was when we knew we could get away with some TKing action and still complete a level, or a little friendly fire that leads to a failure of a match premature to a failure that was likely to occur a few more minutes down the road.

This leads me into the era of video games today. Our precious game that became dominated by hackers and impossible to truly know how good you were because you never knew if the person on the other side of the internet was looking through a wall at you has been remodeled. I say remodeled because I feel as though that is the extent of it. The game’s graphics have been improved and polished and the game includes many new features. It’s new in game features make Counter-Strike Global Offensive an easy game to play with friends and a fun game to watch if you don’t feel like playing. However the underlying problem is still there – you don’t know what the person on the other side of the internet is doing. With the game running $4.00 over Christmas it was a steal and I wish I had bought it for all of my friends but I didn’t think about it at the time.

The problem and it may change in the future is that Valve will never have a way to secure their games. They update, the hackers update, as with the world of technology. Back to the game itself though because I do not wish to take away from its positive qualities.

Counter Strike Global Offensive is available through steam. The game allows you to play as a terrorist or a counter terrorist in many online matches. There are hostage rescue, demolition, and arms race maps. I never checked to see if my all time favorite – THE VIP MAP!!! – is still around but I’m sure there are some servers still running it.

The game is now centered around in game skins which are sold by other steam players in the marketplace, are won randomly in game, or purchased through steam itself. I can imagine that steam is making money hand over fist with these new promotions and their addition of the in-game trading cards. We will never know though since they are a private company.

So Counter Strike? GO. Go should stand for Go Buy it. Even if the game is still riddled with questionable players, it’s still fun to play with friends and still as highly addictive as it was for me 14 years ago. So if you’re peddling your bike to a LAN party, sitting at home drinking by yourself or doing illicit drugs, put down $4.00 – $20.00 for this classic game and relive some old time memories.

Overall rating 8/10 Based on the game, mechanics and memories it was able to conjure up. It lost points for a poor match making system and no way to leave a game without being penalized in competitive mode. This makes it a 45 minute grief session if you get paired up with a bunch of griefing or annoying voiced kids on your team.",True

It's the purest FPS shooter that money can buy. No killstreaks, no deathstreaks, no commander mode, no marksman bonuses, nothing. You buy a gun, aim it at someone's head, and BANG; the person with the highest skill level level will make it out alive. That's why the game is still so popular.

There are no radical changes – only a very obvious lifting, and this series is in trouble. CS:GO is a great game only because the original CS is a great game.

Since i was 7 years old, my brother led me to play CS 1.6 in his PC and I felt pretty shocked at that moment, because that is my first time i play FPS on PC. Now, i found a brand new Couter-Strike called ""CS:GO"", this is an awesome video game anyway, but it's totally different that compare to old Couter-Strike which i usally play. In my opinion, ""CS:GO"" has the best engine and epic graphic performance in all series of Couter-Strike right now, and in this game, you needn't worry about to buy the paid items, because this game only have skins and every guns's characteristic are the same, so that you can using a defult usp to kill a guy who using a $999 awp. By the way, I recommend this game, I'm pretty sure this game is worth buying for you. 10/10",True

6013,"The true successor to 1.6. VALVe really went out of their way to make sure this game came out the way it did, catering both to the grizzled ancients and newbies alike. The engine feels just right when it comes down to firing your weapon and landing the shots, if not rewarding, but expect to be punished for careless mistakes as it always has been on the series in general. The skill ceiling is a high one, as expected, but the game does its best to prepare you for online play with the increased range of difficulty levels for the bots (with 'casual' being nothing short of a shot gallery rather than an actual bot match) as well as the general course; this last one I think works as more of an introduction to the series than an actual tutorial for those already familiar with the basic game mechanics. While I still remain iffy about the introduction of microtransactions to the series, I think VALVe has done it just right by limiting your purchase of skins to the marketplace (a completely optional feature of Steam in general) and, of course, their infamous ""crates"" first featured in Team Fortress and relabled as ""Cases"" for the sake of consistency with the in-game universe. 

As always, Counter-Strike isn't a game for everyone, but whether you're a veteran to the series or just interested in seeing what the fuzz is all about and make a first break into the games, I highly recommend CS:GO.

Also, I apologize for my incessant use of run-on sentences.",True

6057,"I honestly don't understand the mentality of people who have hundreds or even thousands of hours in this and now want a refund. You payed $15 for literal days worth of game while there are plenty of people that will pay $60 for maybe 20 hours worth of game, like are you kidding me? The worst ones are the people with the 5 year veteran coins and like 500+ hours. Why should you even have the right to be refunded at that point? That's like buying a toy and having/using it for 5 years then returning to the store and saying ""Well now you're just handin' em' out so gimme my money back."" It makes absolutely no sense.

Do I feel cheated? No because I enjoy the game and now the people I've always wanted to try it can on their own profile. I can finally have a team to play with, not that I don't like playing alone (clearly given the playtime.)

Is this a bad update? Yeah, it is but at least it's a separate gamemode and not core game changes. 

Would I rather have things like more new maps, an operation, or server upgades? Of course, any of those would have been 10x better but Valve is company and the choice they've made makes sense from a buisness standpoint, which is to attract new players to revitalize the community and more importantly to them, the market.

Should you play it? I enjoyed it as you can see, so of course I would recommend it, especially since it's free now. Just understand that this game is complicated and not for beginners to pc fps or the fps genre in general, it will take a bit of time for you to properly learn this game but I think it's worth it.",True
6058,"It's k, I guess..",True
6059,"I made a review long time ago, but I try my best to rework this and tell a honest opinion about this game.

So Counter Strike: Global Offensive is a FPS game, where 2 teams fighting with each other on different maps / gamemodes. This is prefered to play online. This is well known franchise, also a well known genre, the online shooters.

So, graphiclly this game still on point. Came out in 2012, the game changed a lot, but still looking pretty much good.

Sounds and music is also all right in the game. You can customize the music in the game with music kits, atleast it makes less boring after some time.

Controlls are nothing special either, works fine, and you can customize it.

Is it worth playing this game? Because I hear lot of hatred about this game, either because of the toxic playerbase, or cheaters or both... is it worth playing? I have more than 3000 hours in this game, I have this game in my library since 2015 and I can tell you, if you enjoy the game itself from the beginning, not bothering about the previous said aspects, then yes. If you just think about this game, just as a game, you won't have a problem.

Well, it's a bit complicated now, like it was 3 years ago for example, because of the trust factor. For me, I have okay matches with legit players and I have no problem, but for someone, who just started to play this game, will have bad time to play in non-prime. This is why I really don't like this game atm, new players hardly can join and continue playing this game.

Lot of people also raging about the skins, cases which are coming non-stop, and ""there are no good updates"". If you dob't like skins, then ignore it. About the fact, that we don't have 128 tick servers or Source 2 engine... well, do we really want that? I mean, what would have been if we got it? I don't mind it, but I'm okay with game right now.

You can be better in the game everytime you play, and you can keep playing it to time to time, but remember that it's much better playing in a team, with players who you know. I recommend to play with friends or find others in the game, who are okay to play with, because you don't want to get into a team with full randoms, who sometimes can't even talk in English (not everyone).

Basically, this game is like a cheating girlfriend... you know she is cheating on you, you start to avoiding her, even you broke with her up, but you keep getting back to her. This is the case with me in this game. I'm not a good player, if we compare how many hours I have, but I still like to play this game, helped me a lot in different ways, and I met lot of nice guys through in this game.",True

""Fine"" you say, ""I will just mind my own business to not anger it anymore."" This feeling slowly creeps in more day by day. Whenever you get abused by it, the feeling gets stronger and stronger until you finally break. You shout back at it. You say mean things to it. You try to make the game feel bad. It feels good to relieve all that negative energy that built up inside of you over the span of all these hours that you was abused for, but then you start to wonder: ""When did I become this toxic? Is this really me?"" You start having an existential crisis. You leave the game alone for more and more time.

6156,"Counter-Strike: Global Offensive (CS:GO) the newest addition to the Counter-Strike franchise supposedly takes the best from both its most famous predecessors, Counter-Strike 1.6 and Counter-Strike Source. I as a person who has played 1.6 for approximately 8 years cannot confirm that wholy, but I can at least say that the game is fun to play, with the biggest advantage it has over it's older brothers being the matchmaking. I would easily pay Valve $100 for 1.6 with the matchmaking from CS:GO. But that is not gonna happen so for the time being I just have to settle with what CS:GO offers.

I might have sounded a little more negative than I wanted. The graphics are nice enough even though well aged Source engine, although with the newest tweaks, cannot compare with latest AAA production. Apart from new look you will find your all time favorites from previous Counter-Strike games, same goes for weapons and game mods. However there is not only an old content. You will find couple of new guns and what I appreciated most were new maps created by community and published in buy-able packs by Valve providing the creators with part of earnings.

Later on the game suffered an attack of ""dropable"" content. Fortunately Valve did not step over cosmetic changes, so you can only spend your hard earned bucks on different weapons skins, at least for now.

6180,"This is a great game and in fact one of my favorites. It's a game focusing on tactical strategy, not just run and gun. If you are the king of person that likes run and gun, there are other gamemodes like deathmatch and arms race (gun game) or you could go with tactical things like casual (search and destroy) or competitive (very serious and tough search and destroy). It's a tough game but one of the best ever. Although it's really fun and a great game you need to watch out for some things. Things you need to be very careful about are: 
        Cases. My gosh Valve has to make thousands off of people buying case keys. You will get rewarded cases in games for free, but to buy a key is $2.50. That doesn't seem like much but you'll probably only get skins worth less than what you paid for (yes people pay momney for skins make sure you don't pay too much either.) If you don't care how your gun looks in game you should just sell the cases on the community market. It's okay to open one here or there but the moeny adds up fast. And don't worry you'll get gun drops too.
         Skilled Players: You will rage so hard when you KNOW you hit someone ten times in the heart and did 597 damage but it only registers 3 shots of 23 damage to their arm. People that are skilled are, well, skilled. I guarantee you will get mad at this game at some point. If you want to be paired with people with equal skill play competitive.
         Competitive: When you play competitive there are 30 rounds each 3 minutes long (if you tie the whole game) and you have to accept not to quit the game for the whole length of the game, or you won't be allowed to play for 30 minutes, then 2 hours, then a day, then 7 days and so on if you keep quitting. If your game crashes or something you have three minutes to get back in the game. To avoid this (if you have to leave or something) you can ask your team to kick you. Some don't cooperate but it's always worth a shot.
Now that seems like a whole essay on why not to play, but after all, it's a great game and one of the best first person shooters I've ever played. It's unique, it's fun and it's about teamwork. Don't fall prey to it's clever buying oppertunities but other than that you're fine!

CS:GO keeps being updated after 3 years of its release and it will keep getting better. And i'm not talking just about graphics, which are great and not heavy at all for your graphics card.

SKINS
At this point in time it's obvious that skins are a huge part of cs:go. Me and some friends o'mine have made hundreds of dollars of profit trading/betting. Others have been scammed/lost they're bets/bought cases, but anyone mature should know how to manage their money correctly.

- It's CS 10/10
- The weapons sistem is nothing like the others cs, you can gain the skin weapons by playing or opening boxes or buying them on the market, and that's very cool.

Now the bad review, and this one makes me so angry:

- The competitive: 1 - The team, if can find those noob teams that kill their own partners or just be AFK the whole game!
                   
                              2 - The Competitve Cooldown, now this one it's just annoying and overwhelming stupid, because you get kicked by leaving the game and that's fine but imagine that your net goes down or our PC was turn off because of some lightning, you will get that same kick and you can't to nothing about it and that's makes me so angry because you get 7 days of penalty because you net was down and that's not fair.

6279,"Valve's Counter-Strike: Global Offensive (CS: GO) debuted in 2012, backed by a strong heritage of multiplayer FPS titles, including the original Counter-Strike and Counter-Strike: Source. Now, six years later, the fast-paced PC game still mostly holds its own against more modern titles, partly because of its established core gameplay and active community. Visually, however, CS: GO is starting to show its age and it's not as thematically rich as other popular titles, such as Overwatch. Still, many players will enjoy CS: GO's no-frills experience and competitive scene, especially now that it is free to play.

So, how does CS: GO retain its prominent role in an industry that has diversified considerably since 2012? A big part of its success is due to its massive esports following. It's always among the top titles streaming on Twitch and Mixer, and it benefits from a well-established (and financially lucrative) competitive scene. The game even includes a dedicated Watch section so you can follow and spectate tournaments.

CS: GO is now free to play after a recent update. Its previous $14.99 cost was not expensive, but this price change opens the game to an even wider audience than before.

6314,"I have a few things to say about this game. Firstly, and most obviously, it's free. I've got a bit of a bad history with free games: I have been scammed and they are often just not that good. However, CSGO is just as good as when people paid for it. My only complaint about it being free is that it introduced a lot more hackers into the game, especially in the lower levels. This obviously isn't very easy to deal with, but it can make getting out of the lower stages of the game more difficult than it would be otherwise.

I also really like how well balanced the guns are. The AK and M4 are still the main rifles, but there are other great alternatives that are well worth the price and still give you the bang for your buck. My only complaint here may be (very small though) is that after the Krieg and the AUG were nerfed, they still remained the most expensive CT and T sided weapons apart from the AWP. I understand why as scoped rifles are OP but if there is any case for making them cheaper it would be great to see the price go down by $100-200.

In my opinion, most of the current competitive maps are great. They are all designed very well and lend themselves to multiple types of tactics. One thing I would say is that they are all very CT sided, and the team that starts CT always has the upper hand. As well as this, get rid of the hostage maps. Seriously. Office and Agency are both pretty awful in themselves, and they are breeding grounds for hackers. No serious player actually enjoys these maps.

All in all tho I have really enjoyed this game and I would recommend it to anyone who wants to play a good FPS",True

*Edit after another 2000 hours of playtime:

There are many ways in which we can find CS:GO frustrating to play. Biggest problems (at least for me) to overcome were hackers and seemingly random ranking system in official matchmaking system. Other people get annoyed by toxic players, griefers, smurfs etc., but let's be honest, as long as you play any multiplayer game on any platform, there are always  people that enjoy seeing others in pain or anger.

Luckily, there are ways to solve all issues mentioned above. Third party platforms (Faceit, ESEA, Esportal etc.) are growing bigger than ever before after CS:GO became free to play and hackers are everywhere on matchmaking. Although their anti-cheat software systems are not 100% hacker proof, the amout of hackers is substantially lower than the amount of hackers cruising uncertain waters of matchmaking. Paired with their decent raking system there is one last problem these platforms are yet to solve - toxic players.

For me, it is not that big of a deal. There is always an option to mute and report that one annoying teammate screaming slurs in foreign language, but for a big group of people it does not solve the whole problem, since your experience is already ruined. On Faceit, that group of people is called ECL. ECL consists of many hubs, each having their own join requirements (required Faceit level, hours spent in-game, number of games played on Faceit, etc.), so no new accounts can't join any of their hubs. There is a caring admin team, always opened to help, willing to kick toxic players from ECL hub and always trying their best to make sure you have a good time playing CS:GO.

So after all my time spent playing CS:GO, I found my new home at ECL hubs. For me it is the best place to play CS:GO since you play on 128-tick, anticheat protected, decent ranking system having servers and in a hub, where all rules and admins make sure you can calmly click heads in this glorious game with an insanely high skill ceiling we all love.",True

6359,"Well,this is a game full of hacker,swearing people and noobs, but if you are a noob like me, you can just ignore first tow kind of people. Just have fun,laugh at each others , aim the floor and shoot every thing move. Yup, I mean the chickens. Try to keep alive in Deathmatch and kill every chicken you see, and that's the most re-tarded thing I've ever known……Do I say re-tarded? I mean funniest. Nothing is more funny than killing chickens, except you are the silver one level. If you are in that level by chance, don't be sad, keep going, and you well see what well happend. Yes,0-0-16 and you loss.
       Just kidding, you well grew up. 
       You well learn many things like what is a teamwork, why a reliable friend is a treasure, what I've done lead to my teammate type ""c-y-k-a"" to me. And the most important thing you may learn is how to make a smart choice. When you choose to spend 5200$ in game to just buy a M249 machine gun while you teamates only have pistols, when you choose to reload your god damn Ak rifle while there are 29 bullet left,you well get a shock that how retard your chooses are. Alomst everyone is a noob, because we are not stupid hackers,this guys' technology skill is too high to catch uo with.
As a reward from Valve, they got VAC and loss thier game with skin use permission.

6372,Great game!!!,True
6373,"Well.. This game is Great.. Really to be Honest.. No matter What Valve.. Added into this game.. There's always a way out..
Theres always.. a Depressing times.. Theres always.. the Good times..
This Game is Hard.. I know.. This Game teaches you Patience.. Never Give up.. This is Counter Strike.. And we play it..
We love it.. but for the love of God.. Developers of this game really needs to listen to some good Ideas.. and think about it for a second.. Now let me Rate this Game since i already wasted my Years on this Game.. Spend it Mostly in the Game without Idling it..
My Highest Rank is Legendary Eagle Master.. Yes.. I never went to Global Elite yet..

Gameplay : 
- 9/10 ( Before Spray Update )
- 8.75/10 ( After Spray Update )

Hitboxes : - 6/10 
Pray more.. You need luck in this one

Video Settings : - 8/10 
Graphics doesnt really change much in this.. But its already Great 

Connection : - 9/10 
This is Stable, but Sometimes its really Shit, They should have like the Option to choose  Region

Anti-Cheat : - 5/10 
I admit, i used to cheat with other accounts.. But i stopped because i dont want to waste alot of                                 money.. and I get good and I must say.. The Anti Cheat kinda Sucks sometimes.. If it only depends on the.. Massive VAC Wave.. then.. Its okay.. But there are Cheaters out there.. 
Alot of em 

Prime Feature : - 8/10 
I kinda see this Prime Matchmaking helps the Anti Cheat.. Legit Main Account player Usually
play in this Prime Matchmaking because ever since the.. Steam Mobile Security.. Its hard to get                                      hacked and.. You shouldnt even really have multiple accounts.. 1 is ENOUGH PEOPLE! 

In-Game Microtransaction : - 7.5/10 
This is Great.. You dont even really need to Spend lots of money to Earn Money..                                                           Because.. like this game Gives you money.. For a Small chance i think you will get                                                           that AWP Dragon Lore for Free.

Community : - 6/10 
Theres alot of Salty Players, Cheater, Smurfer.. but i appreciate the Normal people who always                                  gives Feedbacks to the Devs to make this a Great and Balanced Game, and more people are                                  interested in this game so this Game becomes more.. Alive.. But i never knew the whole                                Community like in Reddit and Such Forums, my Country Internet Provider Blocked Reddit and                                 Those Forums and.. Sorry if im wrong.. Who am i to Judge.

Tournaments : - 9/10 
Seeing Professional Players plays this game and Earning money each every Minute of it??                                   This is the game where you get to Watch people Play and Scream and CELEBRATE and 
Earn Money.

Ranking System : - 7.75/10 
This Ranking System.. Is Balanced now.. Since its really Hard to get Boosted.. and People                                             have been complaining about it but i dont get it.. Its Fair.. you want to rank up, fine                  you'll derank anyways because that aint your skill level. Im a Solo Player... 
So my Rank depends on me.

That's all for This Review... Thank you for Reading.. I Hope this is Helpful..
I will not Give up on Counter Strike since.. The First game that my Father introduced me into is Counter Strike 1.6..
And Im hoping this game will Live on to the Future.. and the Community will Grow.. Larger and Better and Stronger.

6376,"[h1] REVIEW OF THE REVIEW : [/h1]

If you never played this game, then this review is for you.

Counter-Strike have been on since early 2000's when steam didnt exist.
Ive been playing this game ever since. This game is probable the best competitive game ever created. 
The way you play the game with your teameates, 5 vs 5, in matchmaking is so satisfying. A 30round ( 16 best match )
with Terrorist VS Counter-Terrorist playing for a full team elimination or a bomb explosion. This game is from far the best FPS shooter game ever made. This game is not for everyone, it takes a while before you can actually be good.

The strategical way of playing each round with the adversity, elements and the surroundings of maps, creates all kinds of ways to eliminate, counter, juke your opponent. The game has so mutch content to learn that even today I keep learning new stuff. There are so mutch ways to get better, by practicing by yourself in close maps with bots. Learn new flashes, smokes. And i can go for hours.This game is a TEAM game in wich you need to always communicate every moove you do, everywhere you look. Know how your teameates plays. The best way is to play with your buddys.


I will try to not get deep in the game when explaning because it can go for hours, so here are the basic stuff you need to know about this game.


When you will start playing this game for the first time, you will cry, scream, be inrage. You might brake your computer in pieces. Here is the tip for you : you will need alot of time configuring the game at first before starting playing it, 
for example ; Getting the good sensitivity with your mouse, choosing a good crosshair, ajusting your graphics ( I would recommend everything on low except for shadow quality, THIS IS A FPS GAME ). 

Learn your sprays with :

- AK
- M4 / M4-S
- ALL SMGS.
- AWP

Once you've learned the basics, you can try to hop on Match making but still will have lots to learn again.

[h1] This game is all about those 5 facts : [/h1]

[list]
[*]YOUR MOVEMENTS ( The way you moove in maps, jumping, cutting corners, bhop, perfect peaks. )
[*]YOUR AIM ( Sprays with guns. )
[*]GAMESENS ( The way you play when using your brain can have a big advantage. )
[*]TEAMWORK ( Communication is the key to moove up in ranks on matchmaking. )
[/list]

[h1] Now here are the bad stuff about this game : [/h1]

[list]
[*]Community is so toxic its unbelievable,
 i mean you can probably get kick in a game for not doing what they asked you or su cking really badly. ( at low ranks ) This is a problem for some people but you dont see it that often.

[*]Vavle is su cking everyones money with skins, and all kinds of crap to buy ingame. It doesnt change anything if you have some or not. Please dont feed Valve.

[*]When you get higher ranks ( gold nova to legendary eagle ) you will go threw lots of hackers, people leaving games,
trolls, or just people that suck at this game. Thats why i recommend playing with your friends is the best way to enjoy it the most.

[*]When you think your good, your actually bad, you can always get better and there always be someone better than you.
It can be frustrating but actually that is what a like about this game. It is all about the person in the back of the screen.

[*]Vavle never release updates to help the game it self, ( hitbox, anticheat, ect ) Like i said Vavle is a money machine.

[*]This game has a really fast paste, it is not for everyone. Some people have played for years and are still very bad at this game ( even if they think they are good ).
[/list]

[h1] IN CONCLUSION : [/h1]

I would recommend this game to everyone that loves shooters, If you can play with a couple of your friends.
There are LOTS AND LOTS OF good times and fun.

6413,"Picture this. You can hear the cars outside, your laundry machine is making noise while you casually strut down de_dust2's curvy parts. Suddenly, silence. Your whole team is dead, you are left with your expensive ak47 skin, 30 bullets and a dream. The world seems to hold it's breath, watching you spend every expensive second on the clock, trying to get a grip on a situation that all your team sees as hopeless. Your brain tries to block out the noise of your russian teammates, discussing how they will f**k your mom if you fail. Comforted by the fact they've pretty much done it with everyone's mom, you keep going. The light sweat starts pearling on the left side of your forehead as you drop down into ct spawn, warming your hands with the flesh of an afk player. Knowing you've revealed your position, you hide in a little corner looking left and right as you can feel the imminent danger. The clock ticks. Determined to never let anything happen to that ak redline, you soothe it with comforting words as you casually press the inspect button, showing off your stickers. You realize there is 20 seconds left. The sudden adrenaline makes you forget about the walking key. You start running like a rhino towards A site, knife in hand like in 'survival tips with rambo'.  The chills penetrate your spine as you hear the sounds of an autosniper in the background, but you keep running. Finally, you reach the bombsite, you check the time and you see there isn't enough time to plant the bomb. You gulp loudly as you fall back to your senses and prepare for the incoming ear rape of your teammates, a bunch of underrage homeschooled squeekers. The silence returns, but only for a second as the whole team votekicks you, pulling you back to the homescreen. Your eyes start to blubber as you feel that, deep down, you did deserve it. You close the game and launch a game of minesweeper to forget the tough times that you have just endured.",True

",True
6424,"There are two ways to review Counter-Strike: Global Offensive.

The [strike]easy[/strike] Silver way, and the [strike]hard[/strike] any other rank way. First off, I'll start with the Silver way.

Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is a good, low cost game, that is often featured at the top of Steam's top seller list. However, be aware, the price that you are paying when you initially hit the purchase button is not the games true price. You [i]will[/i] spend more on this game. Just like when the Counter Terrorists face the Terrorists - this is not a time for negotiation. Get your/your mums credit card ready, because it's going to be used. 
 The first thing I bought was a single key. I got a case drop from my first game, and I thought that the £1.49 investment would be meaningless. I was wrong.
 I was lucky enough to get an M4A4 Howl, in the ""Minimal Wear"" condition. Pretty lucky, when you consider that the current price for it is around £250. It wasn't at the time, it was 10 times less. I still sold it, and invested in more keys. Before playing Counter-Strike: Global Offensive I had no idea what it was like to be a compulsive gambler. I do now.

This isn't the end though. Before I played this game, I enjoyed speaking to people of different cultures, and nationalities. Now, however, I have a burning rage inside me whenever I discover that somebody is from Russia. I'm just glad I finished my A Level in Russian history before I started playing this game. The Polish are a sort of wildcard - some of them you love; they are friendly, helpful, just like your local plumber. Some of them though... You know that they are down the job centre whittling away your paycheck by claiming benefits, then using the computers there to log some hours in CS:GO, to push through smokes, and to buy an AWP in an eco round. You know you shouldn't hate them - everybody makes mistakes, but you are in a blind rage.

You need to win. You need to get out of the Silver ranks. You are now in too deep - you are in the ""other ranks"" stage. You feel you need to prove that you are better than everybody else. First the silvers, you criticise every mistake they make. Even if they aren't Silver... they are now. You rise up the ranks - Gold Nova I, II, then III... you get so close to Gold Nova Master... that fourth star... but before you know it, you slip. You're falling down the ladder... you don't know why. 

People believe that Match Making is a pit. It is not a pit, it is a ladder. Many who try to climb it fail, and never try to climb again. The fall breaks them. Some who are given the chance to climb high refuse - they cling to their rungs, their Master Guardian IIs or their Legendary Eagles. They are content with not believing they can go higher.

Only the ladder is real, and the climb is all there is.

Be warned, once you start climbing, you must keep looking forwards. On the way, you will learn much about yourself - that you have an innate ability to shout curses in foreign tongues, and that you can go weeks without eating as long as it means putting another hard earned sterling towards getting that god damn Asiimov. You will doubt the ability of all those around you, just as they will doubt you. Some days will be good, some bad. Some are easy, but many are hard. You will cry, but you will enjoy every moment of it.

You will make friends and enemies on the way. Children, boys, girls, men, women. Some you will love, many you will like, and even more you will hate. Often you will close your game hoping to ravage a beautiful Norwegian girl, other days you will want to take up arms and burn down entire Eastern European nations. There will be plenty of salt on the way, and it will be used for many different things. You will bury it into the earth, so Russia can no longer sustain life, freeing up valuable space in the EU servers. Often, you will become the salt, as you can no longer hold in your anger - yet you must realise the truth. It was your fault. It was your lack of skill, or your poor reaction time. You're just having a bad day. Many will not admit this, and seek to blame others - on this day, they are the salt. 

Once you begin, as I have mentioned many times, there is no stopping. Many people believe that there are many ""Counter-Strike clones"". There is actually only one. Counter-Strike: Source and Counter-Strike 1.6 are nothing like Global Offensive. The only game that comes anywhere close to representing Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is, in contrary to popular believe, Katamari Damacy. This is because only Katamari Damacy represents Global Offensive on a wider scale - a ball that gains momentum, and keeps growing. You cannot stop the growth. You can't stop, for the ball has grown too large. You reach a point where you are unable to stop your balls from stealing your money, and sending it to a small country thousands of miles away. Your balls give you hatred towards minorities, and towards people who are of not only a lesser skill level than you, but a greater one. Your balls keep growing... until you get to the top.

When you reach the top, you will look back and question yourself. Was it worth it? Should I have alienated my friends? What do I do now? What is that smell? When did I last feed my cat? Where should I bury him? Is it too late to get the game refunded? 

Or, the most important question of all...

6433,"* 10/10 * I'm addicted. This game is so much fun. It's great to play with your friends, easy to learn, and has multiple features that keep you coming back. There are five differnt game types, so there is always something you can play. Even if the game types get old, there is custom, where you can play user made maps, with endless different types of things to do. Something really cool about it is that there are two versions of the main game, competitive and casual. In casual you can practice and it just for fun, with nothing ever being saved. In competitive, wins and losses affect your points, the higher points you have the higher rank you get. People in competitive hope to one day make it to Global Elite, the highest rank possible which very few players ever make it into. Another interesting thing is skins, and using the market. I can't really explain that, so you will just have to play and see. I don't often give a perfect score, but this game is a 10/10.",True

I've lost so much money on skins it's crazy and I'll always regret it.

The game is really well balanced, where the most organized and skillful team wins, but of course there might include a bit of luck, like in any game. That's how CS:GO engages so many emotions in a single match, it's incredible that such a great game is at our reach.

The thing that causes people to hate CS is because of toxic people, before you have a greater trust factor, hackers, and also griefers. All of that can make some people rage (Me included), and that's why it's better with friends, CS:GO is a great, it's community isn't.",True

6563,"The Counter Strike franchise was introduced to me by CS:GO. Several friends of mine were constantly playing so I decided to buy this game. One of the best decisions I've made! This game is the best competitive fps out there and one of the best fps games. It's not a game where you play to unlock guns, attachments, scopes etc. The only thing to work foward to is getting better. This game has a pretty big emphasis on death because the fact you live once per round and you must buy guns at the start of a round, you do not spawn with them. This game also has a huge emphasis on strategy. There is strategy everywhere from how to defend bomb sites to where you plant the bomb on the bomb site. There are two competitve gamemodes: A bomb scenerio and a hostage scenerio. In bomb scenerio the terrorist are trying to plant the bomb on site A or site B and the counter terrorist are trying to stop them. In hostage the counter terrorist are trying rescue the hostages while the terrorist are trying to stop the counter terriost. Both gamemodes are fun and require strategy and map awarness. The competitive match making system makes it easy to hop in with friends or your clan and find a match fast with eneimies around your skill level. The gameplay is very smooth. The shooting mechanics are one my favorites parts on this game with a pretty big emphasis on recoil and headshots compared to other fps games. A downside to this game is the visual element. It's not bad it is playable just not the best the game could look seeing how it was released in 2012. Counter Strike has a decent community most people are open to new players and will give them tips to help them out. I highly recommend this game for people who enjoy competitive fps games. If you enjoy this game you will most likely find yourself pouring countless hours into this game to improve your skill. I rate this game a 9.8/10",True

6599,"It was a pleasant discovery to see the Counter-Strike mod is still if not the most popular technical fps shooter 20yrs on. I tried CS Source some time back and to me it felt like a clunky update from 1.6, just didn't have the smoothness or the glide 1.6 delivered, idk maybe my hardware wasn't up to scratch and I should revisit it simply for the retrospective comparison. This is where I feel CS:GO shines, it really feels like a smoother, much brighter and updated Counter-Strike over the predecessor while maintaining all the sounds and goodies that make Counter-Strike such a great team game to play. The main improvement however as CS and weaponry always felt good in game is the networking social aspect of it. The integration with steam, matchmaking, trust level and player rank really helps a more balanced and equally challenging experience online which is what makes CS:GO competitive in a fun or more serious sense if you enjoy that. Counter-Strike:Global Operations also has a couple of new fun modes such as arms race a type of top fragger deathmatch scenario that changes your weapons as you progress, demolition maps, new fun scrimmage maps, scout wars and casual modes. Once in a blue moon Valve will also release a special operations challenge which are weekly missions to obtain certain medals. I missed the last one which was called Operation Shattered Web and we all anticipate the next one as it kind of takes away the repetition of playing the same maps and level types.

Moving onto some negatives. Be warned as a new player and not having unlocked the trust recognition or prime in CS:GO, the servers are plagued with cheaters and unless you pay upfront for prime you will be matched up with no history accounts and more so likely trolls and exploiters. No matter how many times Valve release an update and anti-cheat, trust enforced boot of CS:GO such as the one back in mid 2020 for example. This release disabled by ability to run FRAPS (an in game frame rate overlay) tool. The update felt promising but within 2 matches there was already someone using exploits and cheats in the game. They either use them upfront and are totally obvious or they are losing rounds and toggle them on. Valve have incorporated and invested a fair bit of money against cheats, lots of servers and overwatch admin to help combat the problem, but it does not fully keep up with the rate of disgruntled and new cheaters out there. There is still plenty of room for improvement and matchmaking with more reliable and experienced steam accounts would certainly help. Also as a new or returning player another hint of warning. In the lower Gold Nova and Silver ranks you will get a lot of hot headed angry players that can be pretty toxic or annoying. Sometimes in a 4 player team up you are always at threat of being kicked from the match, even if you are the most productive player while they blast their mic's in a foreign language making no effort to communicate with you, they wait till its a definite win and kick you. Valve really need to incorporate protection for players against that but I guess it would be hard to gauge what protects you and what does not, though I am sure it could be done.",True

It's a fun FPS game with great matchmaking and balanced guns, with the exception of P90.
Aim is needed for this game, for sure. Once you get the hang of it, using a gun that's hard will be fun and rewarding.

This game is a lot of fun if you decide to play with your friends and have fun while winning than keep blaming your friends. I used to be salty, once. Not anymore!

+Almost everything is a plus
-The uselessness of XP, seriously, why bother adding experience system if people dont get any sense of achievement after leveling up? If you get a skin, most of the time its going to be a really ugly skin, and if you get a case, that's it, either you sell it, or you buy a key to unlock the case.
-Money-hungry devs. I'm not gonna lie, almost everything costs real money here. Yes, it's just cosmetics, but that doesn't justify Valve's money-hungry behavior. Even sprays cost money. Some of them might be cheap, even so, you can run out of sprays, and if you do run out, you'll have to buy it again. It's not permanent.

All the XP things aside, this game is still a 10/10 in my book.

When you will play on low tier like Silver & Gold Nova you may lose many games because of your teammates. They may do basic mistakes like Run & Gun, Team Flash etc. But never rage on them. Always remember we used to do the same basic mistakes when we were beginners. I know this game involves lot of emotion but keep your calm & make sure to teach the beginners. Our community is already toxic, lets not make it more.

You win or you learn, you never lose.

6633,"Decided to re-write my review of this game, this time being a much more well-written review.

Well, here we have the latest game in the Counter-Strike franchise. And it's a damn good one.

Graphics: The graphics are very nice, and it shows definativeily in several of the maps, like Aztec.

Gameplay: The gameplay is solid, fun and at times intense. The way the weapons work is one of the reasons i like the game, they're less accurate when you shoot while moving or if you spray bullets all the time. This forces you to shoot in controlled bursts most of the time.

Music: The music is epic, and i honestly didn't expect that in a Valve game.

You can also obtain skins in the game through random drops. They're completely cosmetic, equipping a skin won't make the weapon more powerful. But it makes them look cool.

Overall, CS: GO is worth every single €. Get it if you like FPS's.

A warning though, if you've played a lot of CS: S and CS 1.6, getting used to GO can take a while.",True

6659,"I've determined that Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is from another dimension. It's a game that doesn't need to exist. PC gamers (thousands of them, according to SteamGraph ) are perfectly served by Counter-Strike: Source and CS 1.6 , content with the decade-something of tuning and attention those games have received.

But here's GO: full of doppelganger Desert Eagles and de_dust déjà vu, quantum-leaping from some parallel timeline whose game industry briefly intersected with ours. Playing it is like running into a college crush at the supermarket. You immediately notice differences. Oh, you're married? Your hair looks different. But that experience of reconnecting is pleasant—they're mostly still the person you admired during geology.

In other words, GO's familiarity helps and hurts. Minor deviations from the CS you might've known or loved are easy to identify. The MP5 is now the MP7, but it lacks the same clicky report and underdoggy “this is all I can afford, please don't kill me” personality. The TMP is replaced by the MP9. Ragdoll physics don't persist after death, curiously. You can't attach a suppressor to the M4 for some reason.

I'm not particularly bothered by this stuff; I don't need the MP5 reproduced precisely as it existed in 2004 or 2000 to live a fulfilling life. What does bug me are some small but significant changes to firing feedback. When you shoot someone in GO, they don't wince. There's a sneeze of blood, and audio that conveys that you're hitting them if you're within a certain range. But they don't do this , and I don't understand the decision to omit a flinch animation on character models.

Especially at long range, it takes a little more effort and squinting than it should to tell if I'm hitting someone or not. And counterintuitively, bullet tracers, new in this version of CS, are an unreliable source of feedback. They seem to trail the path of your actual bullet by a few microseconds. With rifles and SMGs, my eyes would wander away from my enemy and crosshairs--what I should be watching--and try to interpret where my bullets were falling based on the slightly-delayed, streaky particle effects. The small upside to tracers is that they mitigate camping a bit.",True

6662,"Counter-Strike Global Offensive ist das Spiel, welches den Ruf hat, skillbasiert zu sein. Diesen Skill kann man in Valve's Matchmaking-System messen. Das Ziel des Spielens ist demnach das Erreichen einer möglichst hohen Skillgruppe. Jedoch wird man auf diesem Weg als neuer Counter-Strike Spieler sicher merken, dass je höher man kommt, man immer mehr Hacker trifft, die einem den Spielspaß nehmen. Seitdem Valve das Prime Matchmaking eingeführt hat, lässt man den neuen Spielern, die mit non-Prime spielen müssen keine Chance sich spielerisch zu entfalten. Nun könnte man argumentieren, dass diese Trennung aus dem Grund sinnvoll sei, dass die erfahrenen Spieler sich nicht mit dem Hacker Problem beschäftigen müssen, was jedoch keine schlüssige Argumentation ist, da es auch sehr wohl auch im Prime MM viele Hacker befinden. Nun können jedoch MM-Alternativen wie ESEA oder FaceIt viel geringere Anzahlen an Hackern vorweisen. Aus diesem Grund muss Valve definitiv an ihrem VAC noch einmal kräftig Hand anlegen. Valve's Dienst Overwatch kann von Cheatern ebenfalls gemieden werden, indem man in 24 Stunden nicht auf seine elf Reports kommt, weil diese anschließend gelöscht werden. An dieser Stelle wäre eine viel bessere Lösung die Reports pro Spiel und nicht pro Zeit zu bestimmen, was es den Hackern deutlich schwerer mache, zu spielen.

Abschließend lässt sich sagen, dass das Prinzip des Spiels hervorragend ist, aber man jedoch noch deutlich an den Ausschlüssen von Hackern arbeiten muss.",True

6682,"The BEST Counter-Strike game so far! Instead of being a graphical reimprovement, and such, CS:GO is a HUGE reimprovement for an already great franchise, this delivers new things to the table. Such as the Desert Eagle now being one of the MOST innacurate guns in the whole game (Negev doesn't count), rather than being the 2nd most accurate. Everything is improved tremendously, the graphics, the lighting, everything! There ARE some things though that annoy me.

THE CONS
-It feels like there's STILL barely any content. Don't get me wrong there's a lot but it feels like the GUNS themselves could use more. Such as a Remington which increases damage but slows you down, or a minigun that deals MASSIVE damage as a SUPER fast fire rate, but makes you move 1/100 of your movement speed. It could also use more variations to gamemodes instead of the classic 'Bomb' and 'Hostage', such as, one I came up with myself, when the CTs take Terrorists as hostage, known as the Counter-Hostage, and escorting VIPs to special areas (Tactical Intervention, tsk) and more.
-Some maps, such as Lake, were graphical, lighting, etc. remakes of L4D's maps. A fan, whose name I will not mention, realized this and I felt that Valve was just being lazy. It's nitpicking, but it's also kinda true.
-UPDATE YOUR SOUNDS! Seriously! We've been hearing the same walking, gunfire, reloading, etc. noises for almost SIXTEEN YEARS! If you're gonna release a new CS game after 5+ years, update the sounds at least!
-There could be more bombsites instead of A and B. I also wish they did what L4D2 did, changed many routes to give maps a TON of replayability. Again, it's nitpicking, but it's true.

The final verdict for this game, IMO, is an 8.7 out of 10. It's a GREAT game, despite the bugs and exploits (Vertigo, tsk tsk) it's worth the $15. It keeps what makes the Counter-Strike series stand out (no regenerating health, very limited ammo, etc.) and I hope that the next is better. OH YEAH FUN FACTS: 1) Terrorists used the same password for over 10 years. 2) This is even better than CoD gameplay-wise.

The player base in match making seems mostly comprised of people who's main aim in life is to tell you how much you suck at video games and generally treat you with contempt and unfriendliness, but if you play with friends and ignore the unpleasant mob, you can find a rewarding game, and even some genuinely friendly people who are there to help you improve or just have fun in bad situations.

6735,"Death is a great teacher. Failure in Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is, as it always has been for this series, the greatest way to learn where you should have gone, what you shouldn't have done, and how you could have done better. Counter-Strike players spend a lot of time learning -- consequently, they are always getting better.

Growth is an important factor in Global Offensive, especially if you're coming into Counter-Strike fresh or after a sabbatical. This is an extremely hardcore, skill-based first-person shooter, and it forces you to think differently than other modern shooters. If you’re a Call of Duty player, you’re going to need to change your play style to succeed here. Counter-Strike also tries developing into something new here as well, despite doing little to push itself beyond what it’s always done best. Global Offensive modifies old maps to keep veterans on their toes, and introduces official new modes that encourage different play styles for the first time in almost 15 years.

For the uninitiated, Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is a small-scale, team-based first-person shooter with permanent death. When a counter-terrorist kills a terrorist planting explosives in a classic Defusal match, or a CT escort swallows a sniper round in Hostage Rescue, the victim is dead for good and doesn't respawn until the next round. As such, players on both sides must exercise skill and care. The bomb objective, meanwhile, gives everyone a purpose. Of course matches end when everyone on a team is dead, but a clever and coordinated terrorist team will give the CTs the slip, plant their bomb, and protect the bomb site. Between rounds, everyone spends earned cash on better gear and guns, and the cycle continues.

Pieces of the Counter-Strike formula are dated at this point, but the superb heart and soul of Global Offensive is timeless. Teams are small, guns are lethal, and rounds are short. There's an addictive just-one-more-round quality to it, because there's a constant desire to do better than last time, to earn a satisfying kill, or to win in a new way. Call of Duty and Battlefield vets will wonder why they can't sprint to escape enemy fire or look down the iron sights to improve aim; Counter-Strike players will feel like they walked into their redecorated home. Certain map redesigns will catch hardcore fans off guard, but the changes are for the best -- the underpass choke point in de_dust, for instance, has a new escape route.

Even in the face of genre evolution, Global Offensive doesn’t care to adapt. CSGO is so dedicated to Counter-Strike's aging ideals despite market and trend changes that it brute-forces its way to success. Part of what makes it such an engaging competitive game is that killing in Global Offensive requires a wholly different skill set than other shooters. Everyone is limited to what they have and can see, with little room for character modification or on-the-fly advantages. Running and gunning is a useless play style, even if you've bought a helmet and kevlar that round, to the point that someone standing still is more likely to score the kill. Walking, crouching, or standing are your best bets to reduce the inaccurate spray of machine-gun fire

Consequently, killing in Global Offensive feels good. There's a sickening sensation to dropping someone dead because you know they're not coming back. It's also satisfying knowing you used limited resources to play smarter than your victim. If players aren't watching corners, providing covering fire, or using smoke grenades and flashbangs, they're more likely to take a headshot from a more delicate and patient triggerman. The desire to experience that distinct feeling is a strong motivator to keep playing, even when you're getting steamrolled by an obviously better team.

If you've played Counter-Strike before, Global Offensive probably sounds a whole lot like Counter-Strike. Like Counter-Strike: Source before it, Global Offensive exists simply to modernize the look of the classic competitive shooter, while doing little to disrupt the core form and function. At the same time, it does enough to color outside the lines of tradition to justify your time and effort.

Fire is one of the most interesting new combat variables. Molotov cocktails and incendiary grenades either roast groups of guys or force them in another direction. Flames are a useful distraction or scare tactic, too. They're particularly useful during Demolition matches, which focus the fight at a single bomb site rather than giving terrorists two to pick between. The new and modified maps in this mode aren't as big as classic Counter-Strike arenas – entire sections have been cut off to direct teams toward a central location – but their thoughtful design is as intricate as ever. The Lake map is a standout -- there's a wide open yet densely populated yard around the bomb site, which is inside a sizable lakeside home with plenty of vantage points and hiding spots. To separate Demolition from Defusal, players can't buy between rounds. Instead, it takes a cue from the other new mode, Arms Race, in which each kill unlocks another weapon instantly. The better you do, the more you have to switch up the way you play, and because Demolition is so fast you'll need to be quick on your feet.",True
6736,"I thought CS 1.6 or Quake would never be outdated but CS:GO managed to make it. I'll go straight to the point: this is the best multiplayer shooter game.
A real game for esport and casual competition:
- a great gameplay for huge possibilities for whoever can appreciate fps games.
- an addictive game when you find a team or people to play with.
- graphics are great (cs source players, you're going to feel a change)
- a high required level of skill, strategy and game sense, so a really competitive community (that's not CoD, kids).

The first 500 hours of gameplay with the new meta consists of AWP throwing, fake flashes and cheaters with an occasional smurf. CS:GO is not a game for new-comers as non-prime is like your first extra hot chicken at Nandos, it fucks you up real good going down but coming out it makes you cry like you've never cried before.

The next 1000 hours of CS:GO is you either smurfing 90% of your time because you hit global and you are bored as fuck or you continue to play and become a CS:GO YouTuber and earn shit loads and scam kids out of their pocket money on gambling sites with your fake odds. If you hit Global you have to take a flashy screenshot and post it on your profile to show how egotistical and how much of an asshole you are.

Well, I don't know... This game is still one of my favourites for quite a long time and I think it will stay that way. There would be basically nothing wrong with this game if it didn't have so many cheaters or smurf , but despite that you can still enjoy it if you have prime and at least have 2-3 service medals , because then you are unlikely to get cheated . The graphics of the game are competitive wingman modes are impeccable . I haven't found any major bugs in the game yet except for a couple of hitbox bugs , but maybe I cheated my opponent or I looked in.
The whole point of the game is to enjoy it , but these constant annoyances , why don't you just give up is a bit boring in my opinion , because I don't know why so many people are looking at each other's rank when the point is not to enjoy playing together? I guess I will never find an answer to that , because there are few players who don't care about the other rank , but despite that I still think it is one of the best games !

Its a very good game and i have 3 reasons why

1.
movment mechanic, in cs go you can for an example strafe in the air and there for control yourself in the air. there is also one thing called bunnyhopping witch is when you jump and exacly land you will jump again witch makes you gain for momentum. If u combine that with strafing u will be zooming accross the maps.

2.
weapon recoil, cs go has recoil on every gun every gun has a specific pattern that you can learn. If you learn the reacoil patterns you can shoot almost straight but there is something calles nospread witch gets the accuracy to be on %94

3.
The cs go maps if you have the in game setting on high the maps will look very detailed there will be details that you will not even know is there but just makes the game so much better.

I have 532 hours in CS GO and have gotten over 150 wins in competetive and have overwatch witch means i am over gold nova so try to guess my rank in coments

Hey y'all!

I finally got VAC banned after cheating for a long time. Not gonna lie, I enjoyed this little ""trip"" and I even made money from it. Not only I got Prime Status for free (reached rank 21) but I got all the money back from Operation Broken Fang by only using the stars for Cases and sold them on the market (even ended up with a 5€ profit lmao). This was a really good deal Valve, glad that I made money by just playing CSGO. Thanks again Valve! For this reason I am gonna recommend this game!

I bought this game for the chickens, and was not disappointed. After exploring the countless lands the chickens have traveled far and wide, I realized their population was growing too large. The chickens had started to inhabit such horrid locations across the world, such as nuclear plants, and offices without cafeterias. I knew what had to be done. I bought a flip knife off of the steam market, and called PETA. I listened to In the Arms of an Angel in my Microsoft Professional Deluxe Gaming Chair 360 for about twelve hours with no response, so, I decided to take matters into my own hands. I loaded up de_nuke and started to put the chickens out of their misery. I cried harder that night than I have ever before.

The next morning, with tears in my eyes, I loaded up Counter-Strike: Global Chicken, and I saw a new item waiting in my inventory. My Flip Knife had turned into a Flip Knife Slaughter. At that moment, I realized what a horrible thing I had done.
With my hand shaking, I navigated my mouse, and uninstalled Counter-Strike: Global Chicken.

I thing you know what CS:GO is.
If you play it lemme tell you something.
So in some games we get hackers in opposite team.
So we get defeated.
But sometime you can chill and hangout with friends on community servers or on workshop maps.
If you have bad aim.
It doesnt matter.
Good aim is about flexing and being cool.
CS:GO is about having fun and chilling and just shooting.
It doesnt matter if youre bad.
So if your bad at aim just chill with friends or with bots.
And play chill community games like : JailBreak,Aim Trainer or something else

7607,"This is by me top 5 FPS shooter games that ever existed. CSGO have all aspects of game I was searching for. Teamwork, skill, economy, strategy and fun. All of those come with your mentality and how you deal with people. Why? CSGO have really toxic community in lower ranks. You need to deal with different types of people all the time. Thats why you have to practice communication skills too.

Prime status is your main goal when you start the game. Dont get discouraged by cheaters in non prime matches. They will get what they deserve and you stay cool and never be like them. After you get prime you will encounter less cheater, yes they still exist because they hide cheat well.

Advancing trough ranks is easy when you have your friends with you... soo play as much as you can with friends- game will be more fun and less toxic if you have full team(5 people).

remember to practice everyday essential skills on workshop maps like Aimbotz, Recoil master, Reflex maps YPRAC maps for smokes and other nades.

Practice, assemble your team of good friends. Train together and you will reach MG1 really fast.

Things CS:GO gave me
  1. Many great friendships
  2. Broken keyboards/mouses/mics/headphones
  3. Dumb Russians/Turkish people/ Hungarians that can't speak english or can't understand a simple command
  4. Kids that use cheats to feel great one time in their life and then to forget about the game forever
  5. A lot of wasted nights that I could have spent in bed but I always told myself ""Just one more game will give me that sweet rank"" ""I don't care that I'm carrying my team that rank will be juicy""

Do I recommend this game? No. If you are a new player that doesn't know that much about FPS games your experience as a non-prime player in silver will be horrible you will either get carried by smurfs which will make the game boring for you or you will get your matches ruined by cheaters. The one thing I recommend if you are planning on playing this game is: buy an account that is in gold nova and gather a good team of 5 [1 reserve] and try to have fun this game might be all about being competitive but trust me a few jokes make the matches pass like they are 10 minute rounds!

7732,"A game where two sides fight each other to be the victor. It has many game modes but the most played one is competitive mode. In this mode, Terrorists' goal is to plant a bomb at the marked site or to prevent counter-terrorists from saving hostages. It is  counter-terrorists' job to keep the peace. Counter-terrorists could win by defusing the bomb, saving the hostages, or eliminating the terrorists. 

CS:GO is the game that I played most. The game itself is very competitive, but majority of the players are not. Most of them are toxic and don't care about others. There are smurfers (Players who are actually high rankers but playing with low rank accounts), hackers and bullies. I would not recommend it for kids who are underage as these type of players could break their mentality and lead them to have bad morale. On the other hand, if you are a careless person, this game could be enjoyable. 

Their server is another issue that should be solved. Playing online with friends is more fun that playing offline. We, Indonesian, always have problem with connection. However our friends from other countries in Asia seems that they don't have problem with connection. It's either Indonesia's internet or CSGO's server is the problem. I hope Valve do something about it.

Still, I recommend this game because of the action and visual. The satisfaction you got everytime you succeeded to pull a difficult move will hype the whole team including yourself. 

Overall it's a good game with many upsides and downsides. My advice before playing this game is try to get the prime status so that you won't meet any hackers or smurfers. I hope this review could help you decide to play or buy this game.

So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join.

CS:GO or Counter Strike : Global Offensive isnt expensive, and can be afford by anyone with a computer. Dosent tage that much fps, if you have a bad computer. If you tho still feel you have bad fps, then you can lower so many settings, which makes CS:GO a really nice game. Every person can learn and play this. I've seen everyone transform from bad to very good, but practice and time is the key. Hook up with some your friends, and the experince will be better.

NOTICE! There are many scammers online on CS:GO servers. Never press links from someone you dont know IRL (In Real Life) or someone you dont trust. Many thoudsans gets scammed every year, and i dont want you to be that person.
Also get the Steam Autenicator, then you are even more protected.

7971,"I have decided after 3 years and well over 4500 hours (on 4 accounts) of on and off toxicity of this horrendous yet wonderful game, I should finally share my thoughts and opinions on what I find good and bad. So, grab a drink, preferably a vodka or a Eastern European varient if you really want to fit in with the others, and lets get started!

I bought CS:GO in the Summer of 2015, after I had just graduated High school and my friend told me I should get it to play with him. Enthusiastic me thought it was a great idea, after all I had a computer that could run it at a solid 80 FPS on high settings, and I always had a consistent 90+ ping to every server, what could possibly go wrong? Spoiler Alert: I didn't play it actually, I quit the game 3 hours in with the exact words ""Boring and predictable"". Man, I couldn't have been more wrong...

During the rise of Leafy's latest and greatest videos in 2016, I found myself curious of the surfing game he was playing, venturing onwards once more into the great unknown abyss to a massive expanse of fanboys and try hards. I couldn't complain though, right? Hell, I was just surfing for the first 400 hours, what did I know about this game besides strafing and looking around in a smooth mannered way?! Turns out, a lot. From Leafy, I jumped ship to none other than WarOwl, the greatest thing to ever help noobs in counter strike since the invention of aim lock. Now that's an adventure I'm not going to type up because you want to know why you should download this now free game, Hell it's free, but is the time investment worth it? Well...

Along the way of my adventures in CS:GO, I found these free modes that weren't competitive called Arms Race and Demolition, and from there I met the one person who brought me around to staying in this game for the next 3 years. That's all this game is for people, Friends and competition. If you're looking to come into this by yourself and turn out to be the next big pro, I'll go ahead and stop you now, you'll find more success asking out the girl in school who's a lesbian. (This is towards the majority of guys who play the game, go get em' girl) 

All in all, yes this game is wildly successful for a reason, and absolutely worth getting. Have I hated a majority of it, yes. Will I continue to hate everything about this game, probably. What makes this game worth playing then, it's not such an easy answer. In short, Friends, Friendly competitiveness, and all in all, the small 2% of nice people you'll meet.  I do recommend!

Big shout out to Mehbie, Nova, Jakob, Ozvu, Luckey, DJ, Colin, NoCashNoFriends, Jared, Shorty, Richie, Pepper, Didkimo, Mo, Lilli, and many many more. These guys made/make the game worth playing, every bit of it.

8019,"My name is Sebastian, nickname Vaken.I'm 18 and most of my life I've played a game called Counter-Strike.I got my first PC at the age of 6, when I also found out about this game.I was little, and didn't know there is a Competitive part of it aswell, mostly playing Counter-Strike 1.6 on Furien, Zombies, Jail Break, Surf and B-hop.

I was 11 when I first played a 5v5 game, I joined a new thing called...TeamSpeak?I was so nervous I remember cause most of the people there were way ahead of my age, but slowly growing with them.I was so good and so motivated to learn more that actually everyone was calling me a cheater, and ending up getting banned and unbanned from most of the communities that were active at that time.And no, I was not cheating.

I started playing Counter-Strike: Global Offensive back in 2017 for the first time, while I had a really bad PC, playing mostly under 60 fps.Got my first good PC back in 2019, and started playing faceit for the first time.I was obviousely way ahead of everyone, because of such an experience I had during CS 1.6.

I always wished to become a PRO Player, I still think I have the abilities and let's hope one day my dream will become true!

Thank you Valve, for such memories we've done togheter! ❤",True

CS:GO is a fun multiplayer game, the VAC system is superb at banning cheaters and the ranking system places you into the correct rank to play with players at your skill level. This makes it fair for everyone in the game! 

The Great:
+ Operations are released with new missions and maps
+ Various medals for collection
+ Huge range of skins to purchase
+ Multiple game modes to play 
+ Reporting cheaters does work and gets them banned 

The Bad:
- There are some toxic players
- Some areas of the game are infested with hackers
- No 128 tick servers 
- Trust factor placement is questionable 
- Hard to master

Its a hardcore skill-based game that takes weapon recoil to another level, and in Counter Strike, you can't just turn your brain off and run around not knowing what you're doing, it requires skill. The game requires teamwork with your teammates to win, it's a team-based game in which every team is trying to achieve their objective. I think that CS:GO is one of the best FPS's out there. Definately one of my favourites.

8281,"Since starting TF2 in early 2013, CSGO has become my all-time favorite multiplayer game and the best competitive experience of any game I've played. I have a blast playing Wingman and competitive matches with all my friends and seeing how we've grown in skill and playstyle. As well as learning new strategies and the little things that can make a difference. This game has a steep but fair learning curve and rewards patience and tactics like no other. It's rigorous but enjoyable as long as you have the right state of mind and perspective.

In conclusion, it's a great multiplayer co-operative team based game that executes to its strengths very well. After all, Valve has pretty much pioneered the industry from over 20 years of Counter Strike. So you know they know what's up. Just stick with it and give it time and soon you'll be a bona-fide, first person shooter, BOSS.

8286,"Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is overall a pretty good game, but naturally it is not flawless. I've been playing this game for about a year now and I run into quite a lot of problems, the most prominent one being cheaters and griefers. This game has a massive cheating problem, but VACnet is doing a decent job. It learns about new cheats fairly quickly, and doesnt the job pretty well. Now that the game has gone free to play, VACnet needs to be better and more efficient. I imagine the cheating problem will be much worse, and Valve has probably taken this into consideration. Then, they made a Battle Royale type gamode recently and they have done a really good job on it. But, now that the gamemode has been implemented, AMD users are experiencing regular crashes and sometimes cannot start the game. The servers are 64tick, meaning that the hitreg will be slightly inaccurate. I personally think that valve should upgrade their official servers to 128tick, so the gameplay and fairness will be improved.",True

Let's not talk about the times the game goes up and getting to the news,
Even if that's because of the gambling or the game being on ESPORTS..
This game is a classic, First-Person Shooter (FPS), i got ton of skins,
a lot of experience in the game, gamesense, friends, fun.

I recommend this game not because the russians or cheaters, or hitboxes problems that there are and i don't deny it.
I recommend you to play the game to have fun, meeting new players, challenge yourself

Even in online mode you can change the panorama ui background, the font, you can use a text color mode which adds colors to different texts and change up the texts and the best thing is you can chnge the viewmodel, crosshair and gui with only commands inside csgo or in an autexec file.

No wonder CS is 20+ years old. This game is so addictive. I was never really into gaming but this game changed my opinion. This is one of the most accurate FPS games ever made with 128 tick servers. This game requires passion, dedication, hardwork, skill & a lot of practice because every pixel counts when you trigger you gun. 

When you will play on low tier like Silver & Gold Nova you may lose many games because of your teammates. They may do basic mistakes like Run & Gun, Team Flash etc. But never rage on them. Always remember we used to do the same basic mistakes when we were beginners. I know this game involves lot of emotion but keep your calm & make sure to teach the beginners. Our community is already toxic, lets not make it more.

After 2.5k hours in this game i can say that this is the game with most fucked up community, You will see people spinning like fucking bey blades and shooting you through walls (Recent update reduced the number of Hackers), Still the Anti cheat is just a joke, can't detect shit. 

- If you are a new player, Forget having a good time unless you love to get rekt.
- 14 year old Nibbas will threaten you about how they will have intercourse with your mother.
- Everyone is smurf, you will never have a match without someone with at least 1000 hours in the game. 
- Each skin you purchase in the game or through cases, can be converted into real money. 10/10 for skin market and resale values.
- New operations always give you more than enough for what you paid for and that money will also be recovered. 
- Battle royal is shit, as it supposed to be. 
- You will see scammers every month trying to give you different links so you can lose all your skins or your account. If anyone talk to you politely in chat, Block him. He is a scammer. 

- If you fade up with the hackers or the toxicity or the fact that you suck at this game then you can switch to Valorant or Apex for a while, But you will get back to CSGO after some time. 

It is what it is. Just play, Abuse players, Waste money on cases(you can make a fortune if u r lucky with them), Repeat.",True

[b]This game is kind of a mixed bag for me. In and of itself it's kind of mediocre and the game developers don't seem to pay that much attention to it anymore. However, the game's biggest strenght, the simple mechanics, is what really carries it for me. The game is really easy to get into but has a really high skill curve due to it not featuring any sort of aim assist or bloom and overall being very punishing against inexperienced players, especially against higher elo players.[/b]

I probably won't have a popular opinion here but it is how I feel none the less.
I played CS a lot when it was first released as a mod for Half-life. I put hundreds of hours into both pub matches and matches with my friends in private servers. I stopped playing it at about the time that it was about to make the move to a retail product

Counter-strike as a franchise is something of a time capsule. It is a example of a late 90's shooter frozen in time that never really changes and that is probably what makes it both novel for the average gamer and important for the competitive scene that has formed around it (and taken control of it in a lot of ways).Because a e-sports style competitive scene has formed around Counter-strike, it puts Valve in a difficult position because they can't really change anything without facing harsh resistance from the veteran players. Even minor visual changes are met with extreme criticism because they may upset the carefully cultivated meta.

It was not always like this. When I was playing, the idea of e-sports level competitive play was only just starting to manifest and thus it was more rare to find the ultra-competitive players who get wrapped up in memorizing spread patterns, researching dominant strategies and reading up on the established meta. A lot of players back then were just there because it was fun to play and had a huge playerbase (thus meaning that servers were always reasonably available).Playing Counter-strike back then was not the commitment that it can be now. The overall behavior of the playerbase was different. You may have gotten the usual smack talk during a match but you did not have people telling you to do things exactly this certain way in order for the whole thing to play out like a E-sports match either (at least not in any great number).

[i]The game's matchmaking system is very simple and is pretty much comparable to any other game's in the industry. If you win enough, you rank up, you loose enough, you derank. This ranking system is what has held this game alive for all these years. It's REALLY difficult for people to reach the top and as someone who has only reached LE (Legendary Eagle), the 4th highest rank in the game, I can safely say that the game demands dedication, and much of it. This might scare newcomers but it's what in my opinion makes the game so appealing, especially after so many years of playing.[/i]

[u]Overall I think the game is a very skilldemanding game with a huge skill curve which is very rewarding whilst you've mastered it. With decent graphics and great mechanics it still holds up today in this fps-crowded landscape. And also, it's free! <3[/u]",True

8549,"CS:GO - a game that will make you win-greedy.

CS:GO used to be a great game, always had fun playing mostly comptetitively.
It's a game for people that are looking to become really good into a game and like slow-paced gameplay.
Don't expect that being good in Overwatch will automatically make you good in CS:GO, since the gameplay is very different.
CS:GO, also standing for Counter Strike: Global Offensive has a long story of rise and (somewhat) fall. You will have a hard time getting out of the no-rank zone, where you must play with people that are first-timers, like you, or people that have 1000+ hours just warming-up.
Do not expect this to be a friendly game for people to relax. Competitive gameplay is just the kind of fun people have. And yes, you heard me right. People that play this game have more than a 1000 hours on it. I know people that have more than 3000 (some of which make a living off of this game). And this game does have lootboxes but worry not, they are just cosmetics that do not affect the gameplay in any way.
Some people also make a living off of trading. Which is also very advanced.
----------------------------------------------
How the game works and what you're expected to do:
If you're a newbie (noob), you might stay away from the competitive matches and learn how to:
~Strafe,
~Peek,
~Flank,
~Positions,
~Grenade shortcuts,
~Maps,
~Team build,
~Recoil patterns of various weapons,
~Crosshair placement,
~Team placement and 
~How different weapons behave and when to use which.

This might seem like a lot, but most of them are things that take about 10 minutes to learn, but of course, you have to practice them. And don't worry, you can play this game as a hobby.
Most of these stuff can be learned through YouTube videos, chats, coaches/friends, the community on Reddit, Steam and verious different websites or etc.

When you think that you are ready for competitive gaming, you will realise that most of the people you're playing with are kids or people that don't talk your language and have completely no knowledge of the game.
Most of the time you shouldn't worry, because you can also find good teams on special website to build teams.

After winning 10 matches, give yourself a pat on the back. You have reached your first rank! 
Silver 1.
Now, one thing that you should worry about in competitive matches are smurfs or hackers. This is why you should almost never play solo if you want to win.
Smurfs are people that have a higher rank, silver 5 for example, but play on a second account or intentionally lose to rank down so they can play vs. lower-skilled players.

Also, after getting through, let's say Silver 2, and you're now Silver 3, it's time for you to start warming up!
You can warm-up by playing stuff like Deatchmaches, or casual (the place where you started) or download maps from the workshop page. The workshop page is a place full of nicely put togheter maps for different purposes.
There are maps for learning how to Strafe, throw grenades or anything from above!
And of course maps for warming-up!

Community servers:

CS:GO is not jsut a standard shooting game, you can also do things such as surf, bhop or play various different mods, that can be found on the community servers.

I really hope that this review helped you decide if you want to play this game or not.

8555,"Counter-Strike makes you work to enjoy the content, and you'll have to put many hours of play into it before enjoying the feeling of conquering it.

Weapons are a huge part of the series too, with CS:GO not an exception. Each round provides a cash sum based on your previous performance, and with this you can purchase armour, projectiles and weapons. Firearms range from standard assault rifles to shotguns and sniper rifles, and you'll want to experiment with each one to see which works best.

What makes Counter-Strike such a popular series - and what will no doubt make CS:GO the next big PC shooter - is the thrill of the ego chase. As you die, often continuously, the frustration is outweighed by an aspiration to do better. In a game where success is pinned on attention to detail, death often triggers an internal failure analysis that the player will mull over while waiting for a new session to load. It becomes a spiral of egging yourself on to do better - and if you become a good player, the game becomes a stage for you to parade your skills.

Global Offensive builds on the CS series by going through a significant checklist presented by its community and marking off as many points as possible. Gun game as its own separate mode? Check. Competitive capabilities built in? Check! Map balancing here and there? Check, check, check.

As a result, there are numerous upgrades that will adjust gameplay while also making accessibility far better. The wide range of grenades, for example, will likely make play more tactical - laying down incendiary grenades will thwart rushes, while decoys, which fake gunfire and fool radar points, are brilliant tools for messing with the minds of established players.

The actual core shooting will be a huge talking point for many months to come. It has been tinkered slightly and gives weapons a noticeably floaty feel, which doesn't sit well to begin with. We eventually found ourselves enamoured by it, and the impact of hits add a real tactile distinction to play.

It's what doesn't work, however, that is most notable. Regular mode has no new maps added to it, while all the new guns seem somewhat cosmetic. Global Offensive has also removed some of its middling weapons such as the MP5, essentially pushing even more players to stick with the AK and the M4. Sometimes it gives the impression that there is in fact less valuable content than in previous CS releases.

If one assumed this was Counter-Strike Source with a visual mod installed, there would often be little to shake that impression.

There's also now a split between casual and competitive servers - however, many players aren't yet aware of the differences, mainly because the distinction isn't made obvious enough. It becomes even more confusing if you join a community server with all hosts of mods installed on it, which have perhaps taken casual mode, turned friendly fire on and essentially made it as close to Source as possible.

At times, arranging games in Competitive Mode feels like a chore. Joining a five-on-five war is simple enough, but attempt to lobby up with a group of friends and join a game, and you'll often hit a snag. Myself and a few others tried to find a competitive game with no luck, simply being told that no servers were currently available.

When you finally do join, it works fine, but the wait and work required to find a game seems like a drawback. We eventually gave up and resorted to using IRC to find matches, as we would with Source.

Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is not the key evolution point that we were hoping for, and the response from the community often reflects this view. On many occasions, other players used phrases such as ""same old"" to us.

This is elementally Counter-Strike Source with some fine-tuning under the bonnet, and Valve appears to have acknowledged this with the reasonable RRP attached to it.

And yet the core DNA of the game has not lost its appeal. This is still a glorious experience that sets a benchmark for all multiplayer shooters. Valve's objective with Global Offensive was to draw together the active communities of both the Source and trusty 1.6 edition. It clearly has a good chance.",True

8663,"Death is a great teacher. Failure in Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is, as it always has been for this series, the greatest way to learn where you should have gone, what you shouldn't have done, and how you could have done better. Counter-Strike players spend a lot of time learning -- consequently, they are always getting better.

Growth is an important factor in Global Offensive, especially if you're coming into Counter-Strike fresh or after a sabbatical. This is an extremely hardcore, skill-based first-person shooter, and it forces you to think differently than other modern shooters. If you’re a Call of Duty player, you’re going to need to change your play style to succeed here. Counter-Strike also tries developing into something new here as well, despite doing little to push itself beyond what it’s always done best. Global Offensive modifies old maps to keep veterans on their toes, and introduces official new modes that encourage different play styles for the first time in almost 15 years.

For the uninitiated, Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is a small-scale, team-based first-person shooter with permanent death. When a counter-terrorist kills a terrorist planting explosives in a classic Defusal match, or a CT escort swallows a sniper round in Hostage Rescue, the victim is dead for good and doesn't respawn until the next round. As such, players on both sides must exercise skill and care. The bomb objective, meanwhile, gives everyone a purpose. Of course matches end when everyone on a team is dead, but a clever and coordinated terrorist team will give the CTs the slip, plant their bomb, and protect the bomb site. Between rounds, everyone spends earned cash on better gear and guns, and the cycle continues.

Pieces of the Counter-Strike formula are dated at this point, but the superb heart and soul of Global Offensive is timeless. Teams are small, guns are lethal, and rounds are short. There's an addictive just-one-more-round quality to it, because there's a constant desire to do better than last time, to earn a satisfying kill, or to win in a new way. Call of Duty and Battlefield vets will wonder why they can't sprint to escape enemy fire or look down the iron sights to improve aim; Counter-Strike players will feel like they walked into their redecorated home. Certain map redesigns will catch hardcore fans off guard, but the changes are for the best -- the underpass choke point in de_dust, for instance, has a new escape route.

Even in the face of genre evolution, Global Offensive doesn’t care to adapt. CSGO is so dedicated to Counter-Strike's aging ideals despite market and trend changes that it brute-forces its way to success. Part of what makes it such an engaging competitive game is that killing in Global Offensive requires a wholly different skill set than other shooters. Everyone is limited to what they have and can see, with little room for character modification or on-the-fly advantages. Running and gunning is a useless play style, even if you've bought a helmet and kevlar that round, to the point that someone standing still is more likely to score the kill. Walking, crouching, or standing are your best bets to reduce the inaccurate spray of machine-gun fire.

Consequently, killing in Global Offensive feels good. There's a sickening sensation to dropping someone dead because you know they're not coming back. It's also satisfying knowing you used limited resources to play smarter than your victim. If players aren't watching corners, providing covering fire, or using smoke grenades and flashbangs, they're more likely to take a headshot from a more delicate and patient triggerman. The desire to experience that distinct feeling is a strong motivator to keep playing, even when you're getting steamrolled by an obviously better team.

If you've played Counter-Strike before, Global Offensive probably sounds a whole lot like Counter-Strike. Like Counter-Strike: Source before it, Global Offensive exists simply to modernize the look of the classic competitive shooter, while doing little to disrupt the core form and function. At the same time, it does enough to color outside the lines of tradition to justify your time and effort.

Fire is one of the most interesting new combat variables. Molotov cocktails and incendiary grenades either roast groups of guys or force them in another direction. Flames are a useful distraction or scare tactic, too. They're particularly useful during Demolition matches, which focus the fight at a single bomb site rather than giving terrorists two to pick between. The new and modified maps in this mode aren't as big as classic Counter-Strike arenas – entire sections have been cut off to direct teams toward a central location – but their thoughtful design is as intricate as ever. The Lake map is a standout -- there's a wide open yet densely populated yard around the bomb site, which is inside a sizable lakeside home with plenty of vantage points and hiding spots. To separate Demolition from Defusal, players can't buy between rounds. Instead, it takes a cue from the other new mode, Arms Race, in which each kill unlocks another weapon instantly. The better you do, the more you have to switch up the way you play, and because Demolition is so fast you'll need to be quick on your feet.

Unlike other game types, Arms Race allows for respawns. It's the most chaotic and care-free mode in Global Offensive, with players throwing caution to the wind for the sake of climbing the kill ladder as quickly as possible. It's a shame there are only two maps in Arms Race -- a problem that will more likely persist on consoles than PC.

If you have the option, playing the PC version is unquestionably the best way to experience Counter-Strike: Global Offensive. Mods, mouse and keyboard, and the usual PC-only options are better than the ports.

But not every one can bear the pressure there are some people in this world that cant co-op with anyone. and they start cheating, hacking. that is the only thing bad with this game, there are other problems (64tick-128 tick, sometimes stupid bots, maps not being optimized) but they are not as much compareble to the hacker problem. if you can co-op with the rare chance of having a hacker in your opponent team then this game is for you, but if you hate hackers 1 tapping you through stuff then you should kick the hacker carrying you  through the Match. as this hacker that is carrying for you is destroying confidence of the other team.

8684,"Hi, counter strike global offensive is a skill based game.
I played it now for nearly 2000 hours, so i am a very confident player.
The matchmaking system from valve is a nice idea but the preasure of a rank can make you very mad sometimes.
I played in nearly in every rank of matchmaking, and you often play against cheaters in the higher ranks.
Especially non-prime matchmaking is unplayable in higher ranks.
Overall you should just play and try to get better, ignore the cheaters and just report them.

There are a few more competetive modes beside matchmaking from valve, for example faceit.
Its based on the same bomb scenario , but it gets played on private servers from faceit.
That means less cheaters because they have a better anti-cheat system, There are also skill based ranks from 1-10.
Faceit is a good variety to matchmaking!

A little tip from my side, play with your friends in a 5 man lobby, or you will get russians with 3000 hours who can't even pronounce their names right...

Overview is good but with a bit of worrisome. I watch several video on people doing overwatch. Some did correct and the other is not. A friend of mine whom had a pc with good spec is running the game with good fps. He was vac because overwatch guy misjudge him.

8728,"A game with a simple objective but deep and complex mechanics, counter strike is a game for beginners and professionals, young and old and serious and casual players. If you've ever heard of ""video games"" in the modern time, chances are you've heard of counter strike. Be it the classic 1.6 that started it all or the upgrade source. Counter strike has been the most popular game in the last decade and has been dominating the market. However does counter strike global offensive (commonly known as csgo) hold up to all the hype and does it perform well to continue the legacy? The answer is yes. Cs go is a master piece of a game. And it certainly deserves to be one of the best, if not the best game of all times. I've been a player of 1.6 and played it for a long time, however due to a recommendation by a friend (shoutout to @ganjaboss) I decided to switch to go, and man I wasn't disappointed one bit. It certainly redeems it price and adds much more to the experience. The fluidity and gameplay experience was on point. After playing 1.6 it took a while to adjust to the mechanics but the out come of all the hard work and effort you put into the game is skill which no one can take away from you. 

Skills are a big part of the competitive scene of cs go, but to all the newbies out there, you don't have to play competitive right away. You can just play the casual mode of the game to get used to the mechanics. 

The mechanics of the game is the factor that seals the deal for me. The fluidity in the game play and the rewarding nature of the game is appreciated.

But the most important factor that has made the game so popular is the community involvement. Now while you may encounter toxic players every now and then, it is inevitable in every multiplayer game to encounter such players. However worry not those toxic players can't outweigh the good experiences you'll have during the game and the friends you'll make along the way.

So if you're thinking of buying the game however you fear that the game might be ""dead"", here's a statistic; csgo recently crossed dota 2 in player base.

Don't hesitate, buy the game, you'll love it.",True

8746,"Hello there, are you looking for some advice on the global sensation of ""Counter-Strike Global Offensive""?? Then look no further! I shall tell you exactly what to expect before downloading this shrine of a game created by Valve!

Firstly, I would just like to point out that I have been playing this game for many years along with achieving ""The Global Elite"" across many accounts (thanks shroud!). Across all of my accounts I have roughly around 12,456 hrs (and that isn't counting time in the menu!!). I hope this assures you that I know exactly what I'm talking about. :P

Counter-Strike has always had a place in my heart. When I would come home from school after getting bullied for watching too much anime, I would always log on to my pc and load up CSGO. It was amazing. The game helped me forget about the hard times I go through at my place of education, and my friendly English-speaking team would always reassure me that things were going to get better! If it wasn't for CSGO, I probably would have committed suicide back in 2003! I am forever grateful for this game as it helped me through the hard patch in my life, and it helped me continue to become stronger in the real world!
However, not too long ago, Valve decided to make this game Free-to-play, and my lord was that a terr-- such a good idea!!!
Hackers no longer exist in lobbies. TK-ing and griefing in general just does not happen anymore, IT IS AMAZING. I would like to meet the member of staff at Valve that suggested to make the game free-to-play and personally thank them and take them for a pint down at the local brewery.

To conclude, Counter-Strike Global Offensive is probably the best competitive rank-based game out on Steam! I will continue to play this game 26 hours a day and watch it grow into something even bigger. That's all from me today guys! Happy Hacking!!",True

However, There are some players who use hacks,it is not the only csgo's problem. Hackers exist all most everygame.

8877,"With all my playtime, and all of the fun I had with this game, I must give it a thumbs up, even tho since the beginning of 2016 I don't enjoy the competitive gameplay and the core of the game. 

Valve's money addiction made this a bad game, the issues are the same since a long time and valve still hasn't managed to fix them. They only care about cases and ridiculous updates with FUCKING GLOVES ????? AND SPRAYS ?
They use their playerbase to dig as much money as possible. And that is well known. + the whole gambling and money community has broken down the fun aspect of the game to me and really harmed the game.
This is why I only play on community servers at this time.
The matchmaking is unplayable at high elo and is not fun at all. 
The layout of the game has been the same for ages and so much could be done ! But no. Valve prefers releasing glove cases and etc.


Well to sum it up, this game has died to me since valve started making a lot of money in this game and it will not change.",True

8907,"Counter Strike: Global Offensive - Or as i like to call it - Counter Strike: Russian Aggressive
Just when you think you couldn't find a game more triggering than Call of duty, fifa or League of Nerdlands, CS:GOHome allows you to vent your frustration both to your Eastern European friends as well as the 4Q Stack of Russians in your team who do not speak a word of english except from profanities. They seem to all be reproducing with your mother,sister and brother, even if you don't have a brother. Next up we have the ranking system, why play against players of your own skill level when you can play against players who have 10X more experience than you? CS:GO allows you to do this with the HIDDEN smurf system. Great players create new accounts and play against players much below their skill level in order to teach these new players good lessons about smashing their keyboards off of their walls and breaking their vocal cords in rage. On to the next topic, Cheating. Counter Strike: Hacker Offensive includes an in-built VAC system or as i like to call it, Valve Allow Cheating. Why play against players with your own two hands when you can have a computer program instantly land head shots for you? Or the ability to see through walls to hunt down your enemies like a doctor carrying out an X-Ray scan on a patient.",True

8910,"I spend more time on playing Cs:Go then every other Pc game in the last time.
This game sure has its up and downsites but if you can get into it it will be one of the best games you will ever play.

Pros:
-More skillbased then any other shooter out there
-Most of the weapons are pretty good balanced (there are a few which should be rebalanced in my opinion)
-You really need to invest some time into the game to get better like practice aim, smokes, movement, recoilpatterns and all that stuff because its so much different to other shooters (for others this might be a con but I like it that there is always more you can learn about the game)
-Various different gamemodes (most of them are really fun to play)
-A great competetive matchmaking system

Cons:
-This game has a problem with hackers, although I face them by far not as often as others say in their review
- As I said, some guns need a rebalance (Why can you kill with one headshot with a 300$ Pistol but not with a 3100$ Rifle?)
- The 64Tick matchmaking servers 
-Not really a problem with the game itself but once you got a Cs:Go inventory worth 200$ or more you will get friend request spammed by scammers (Valve should really get rid of them)
-When you are playing non-prime matchmaking and/or in a lower skillgroup you will face plenty of smurfs who will totally f**** you in the a** without lube.



I can understand that some players on lower skillgroups rage about this game, calling it broken and full of hackers.
But once I got out of the silver leagues (I'm DMG now) it all got better and better.
The community isnt as toxic in my rank as it is in the lower ones and I even enjoy playing solo-q. 
From time to time you will meet toxic players who wont stop insulting everyone and everything while playing worse then a brain dead monkey.
But I also met great people in Solo Q and I still play hours of Cs with those randoms from Solo Q, who became friends by now.

If you are looking for a game which you can buy and immediately start stomping enemys just because you are naturally good at shooters then you wont have any fun with Cs:Go.
You will die... a lot.
And you may come to a point where you think to yourself ""I really want to get better in this game!"".
And when you reach this point, start training and investing some time into the game, then this game becomes one of the greatest games ever.",True

The only thing thats a huge downfall is the immense amount of people using cheats to get ahead of the game. It really does take the competative and thought-provoking aspect of the game and tear it from you.

But other than that, its a fantastic round based game. Once you get to a level where you can get Prime Matchmaking, things do go alot smoother, and the people you play against are 95% legitimate players. Your losing games are lost to players of proper skill instead of a random smurf or cheater. And thats something I can respect.

My biggest reccomendation is that Valve invests in an anti-cheat system that recognizes files from various cheating programs and work around trying to erradicate the pandemic. Another reccomendation would be making Prime Matchmaking Mandatory. A linked phone number to a CSGO account really does cut down on cheaters and smurfs by a cluster buttload. 

Otherwise, a wonderful, tactical, and strategic game mixed with a need to train your reaction time and precision. A perfect game for the focused gamer.",True

Ingredients
- To Make the Dough
375 grams (3 cups) plain flour
1/2 teaspoon salt
2 eggs
1/4 cup (50 ml / 3½ tablespoons) olive oil
1/2 cup (120 ml / 8 tablespoons) water
Extra flour for dusting 


- To Make Cheese Filling
15 ounces (425 grams) container Ricotta cheese
5 ounces (142 g/about 1/2 cup plus 2 tablespoons) ""3 Cheese Italian Blend"" (Parmesan, Romano & Asiago)
Note: grate these cheeses yourself and create your own custom blend.
1/2 cup cheddar cheese
2 eggs, lightly beaten
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon pepper


- Extras
Your favorite sauce for the ravioli (i.e. marinara/ marijuana)
Parmesan cheese
Basil
Fried vegetables
Shrimp
Fish slices
Chicken pieces 
Make the Ravioli filling.

- In a small mixing bowl, add the ricotta and mash with a fork.
- Add in the 3-cheese blend, Cheddar cheese, eggs, salt, and pepper.
- Mix all ingredients thoroughly until you have a smooth, paste-like consistency.
- Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and place it in the refrigerator for about 30 minutes. 

Make the Ravioli dough.

- Crack eggs into a large mixing bowl and beat them with a fork. Add water, oil, and salt. Mix.
- Add 1 cup flour to the bowl. Use a fork to mix the flour with the eggs, water, oil, and salt. Repeat with the rest of the flour. Mix until a smooth dough is formed.
- Clear and clean off a large work surface and dust it with flour. This is where you are going to roll out your dough.
- Take the dough out of the mixing bowl, shape it into a ball, and place it on your work surface. Knead for at least 10 minutes or until it becomes elastic.
- Dust a rolling pin with flour to prevent the dough from sticking. Roll out the dough until it is about 1/8 inch (1/3 cm) thick, or about the thickness of 2 stacked quarters.
- With a cookie cutter or upside-down water glass, cut out circles in the dough (will make about 15-20 dough circles).
- Ball up the unused dough and either roll it out and make a couple more raviolis, or wrap it and put in the freezer for another time. Dough can keep for weeks when frozen. Just make sure to wrap well so that it doesn’t suffer from freezer burn or absorb freezer odor. 

Fill the Ravioli shells.

- Take the ravioli filling out of the refrigerator and place a tablespoon of it in middle of a dough.
- Fill a small bowl with water, dip your fingers in, and moisten around the outer edge of the dough circle.
- Fold the dough in half over the filling, making a half-moon shape. Be sure all the filling stays inside. Pinch the edges together and then seal the edges of the ravioli with a fork. Make sure to press firmly and go all the way around. This will add a “homemade” touch as well.
- Repeat this process for all your dough circles.
- Dust the finished ravioli with flour to keep them from sticking together. 

Form the Shells and Fill Using a Ravioli maker.

- Roll the dough into two sheets
- Place one sheet on the ravioli maker, and form the filling cups.
- Fill with the ravioli mixture.
- Lay the second sheet of dough on top, and roll it out. This will seal in the filling.
- Remove and separate the finished raviolis.

Cook the Ravioli.

- Fill a large pot with water and bring to a boil.
- Place the ravioli in boiling water for 5-6 minutes, or until they float. You can also test for doneness by nibbling on the edges to test.
- If you don't want to make all the ravioli at one time, you can freeze the rest 
- Take ravioli out of boiling water with large slotted spoon and place on warmed plates

Serve it up.

it doesn’t matter whether you’re flicking your AWP, flipping your knife, or rushing B. you’re engaging in some of the most esteemed and elemental practices in Esports.

and whatever happens, whatever the future holds for the beautiful, ballistic thing that is Counter-Strike, it isn’t going anywhere.

• 1063 Hours
• 499 Wins
• Ranked to 'Glowball' about 10 minutes ago
• A decent understanding of the game

Lets start by saying this game is not for anyone with a short temper, nor anyone who is not willing to work as a team. The best advice I can give it to ""Communicate in Comp, be deaf in Deathmatch"". So let's tackle the CS:GO Stereotype... Russians. They are no problem, just like any other player you should never antagonize, annoy or shoot in the general direction of (Unless they do the same to you) I mean just mute them and let them do their thang gurl.

Cheaters... ""Nice Hacks, enjoy VAC and Overwatch ban"" I hear this too much... Like every game (Silver 1 > MG2) but truth be told they are just a better player. The amount of cheaters have decreased massively and if you are unlucky to play with one... Hang around or spin bot. You will lose but when they get banned you effectively win that game. And for Christ sake, if there is one on your team REPORT & KICK THEM!

What comes next...? Well I have no idea. I always expected the unexpected but this game keeps giving. New boosts, hidey spots, wall bangs and those bloody sound updates. WHO asked for those Volvo? Let alone 3 of them in 1 year. All this aside I am now Global and have only just scratched the surface.
This game deserves my ""Thumbs Up"" and I take great pleasure in saying...

9097,"Death is a great teacher. Failure in Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is, as it always has been for this series, the greatest way to learn where you should have gone, what you shouldn't have done, and how you could have done better. Counter-Strike players spend a lot of time learning -- consequently, they are always getting better.

Growth is an important factor in Global Offensive, especially if you're coming into Counter-Strike fresh or after a sabbatical. This is an extremely hardcore, skill-based first-person shooter, and it forces you to think differently than other modern shooters. If you’re a Call of Duty player, you’re going to need to change your play style to succeed here. Counter-Strike also tries developing into something new here as well, despite doing little to push itself beyond what it’s always done best. Global Offensive modifies old maps to keep veterans on their toes, and introduces official new modes that encourage different play styles for the first time in almost 15 years.

For the uninitiated, Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is a small-scale, team-based first-person shooter with permanent death. When a counter-terrorist kills a terrorist planting explosives in a classic Defusal match, or a CT escort swallows a sniper round in Hostage Rescue, the victim is dead for good and doesn't respawn until the next round. As such, players on both sides must exercise skill and care. The bomb objective, meanwhile, gives everyone a purpose. Of course matches end when everyone on a team is dead, but a clever and coordinated terrorist team will give the CTs the slip, plant their bomb, and protect the bomb site. Between rounds, everyone spends earned cash on better gear and guns, and the cycle continues.

Pieces of the Counter-Strike formula are dated at this point, but the superb heart and soul of Global Offensive is timeless. Teams are small, guns are lethal, and rounds are short. There's an addictive just-one-more-round quality to it, because there's a constant desire to do better than last time, to earn a satisfying kill, or to win in a new way. Call of Duty and Battlefield vets will wonder why they can't sprint to escape enemy fire or look down the iron sights to improve aim; Counter-Strike players will feel like they walked into their redecorated home. Certain map redesigns will catch hardcore fans off guard, but the changes are for the best -- the underpass choke point in de_dust, for instance, has a new escape route.

Even in the face of genre evolution, Global Offensive doesn’t care to adapt. CSGO is so dedicated to Counter-Strike's aging ideals despite market and trend changes that it brute-forces its way to success. Part of what makes it such an engaging competitive game is that killing in Global Offensive requires a wholly different skill set than other shooters. Everyone is limited to what they have and can see, with little room for character modification or on-the-fly advantages. Running and gunning is a useless play style, even if you've bought a helmet and kevlar that round, to the point that someone standing still is more likely to score the kill. Walking, crouching, or standing are your best bets to reduce the inaccurate spray of machine-gun fire.

Consequently, killing in Global Offensive feels good. There's a sickening sensation to dropping someone dead because you know they're not coming back. It's also satisfying knowing you used limited resources to play smarter than your victim. If players aren't watching corners, providing covering fire, or using smoke grenades and flashbangs, they're more likely to take a headshot from a more delicate and patient triggerman. The desire to experience that distinct feeling is a strong motivator to keep playing, even when you're getting steamrolled by an obviously better team.

If you've played Counter-Strike before, Global Offensive probably sounds a whole lot like Counter-Strike. Like Counter-Strike: Source before it, Global Offensive exists simply to modernize the look of the classic competitive shooter, while doing little to disrupt the core form and function. At the same time, it does enough to color outside the lines of tradition to justify your time and effort.

Fire is one of the most interesting new combat variables. Molotov cocktails and incendiary grenades either roast groups of guys or force them in another direction. Flames are a useful distraction or scare tactic, too. They're particularly useful during Demolition matches, which focus the fight at a single bomb site rather than giving terrorists two to pick between. The new and modified maps in this mode aren't as big as classic Counter-Strike arenas – entire sections have been cut off to direct teams toward a central location – but their thoughtful design is as intricate as ever. The Lake map is a standout -- there's a wide open yet densely populated yard around the bomb site, which is inside a sizable lakeside home with plenty of vantage points and hiding spots. To separate Demolition from Defusal, players can't buy between rounds. Instead, it takes a cue from the other new mode, Arms Race, in which each kill unlocks another weapon instantly. The better you do, the more you have to switch up the way you play, and because Demolition is so fast you'll need to be quick on your feet.

Unlike other game types, Arms Race allows for respawns. It's the most chaotic and care-free mode in Global Offensive, with players throwing caution to the wind for the sake of climbing the kill ladder as quickly as possible. It's a shame there are only two maps in Arms Race -- a problem that will more likely persist on consoles than PC.

If you have the option, playing the PC version is unquestionably the best way to experience Counter-Strike: Global Offensive. Mods, mouse and keyboard, and the usual PC-only options are better than the ports. Plus, Valve is much better about long-term PC support -- it abandoned Team Fortress 2 on consoles, and Portal 2's level editor was PC exclusive. If you prefer to play on consoles, Global Offensive is the same great game",True

CS is a slow-paced game -- funny thing is that it was pretty fast in the days of Rainbow Six - where two teams try to eliminate each other while attempting a secondary objective (rescue hostages or plant a bomb). The two defining features of the game are the permanent death that forces players to spectate until the next round begins, and the ability to purchase weapons and equipment at the start of each round with money earned from kills and victories. You can find these features in Call of Duty’s Search and Destroy mode as well as Shadowrun (2007), but outside a couple mods for Quake and Unreal Tournament no one has attempted to replicate the full package.",True

GO sticks to the classic maps, mechanics, and weapons, while adding a few new of each, but without diluting or harming what makes its gameplay great.

Der Einstieg ist bei diesem Spiel besonders schwer. Die Grafik erscheint veraltet auf den ersten Blick, die Physik unrealistisch, doch das hat einen Grund.

Es gibt dazu viele Tutorials auf Youtube. Ich kann euch auf jeden Fall sagen es ist das beste Gefühl seinem Team einen Sieg verschafft zu haben, vor allem wenn man dieses Team persönlich kennt.

9273,"CS:GO is a game made for competitive gameplay, but that doesn't mean it has to be serious all the time.
At one time or another almost every player has picked up a zeus and just ran around the map trying to taze someone and had the time of their life while doing it.
It's a fun game to play with friends for sure, unless you wish to take it to the competitive level instead of the casual aspect of the game.

It's a pretty straight forward game, you walk around shooting the bad guys, pretty simple right? That's how the game's played by the more casual player. Competitive players take the game to the next level. You have a somewhat realistic spray control (ignoring the fact that you have to aim at the floor sometimes), a complex teamwork involving grenades, timing and strategies.

CS:GO presents immersive graphics, realistic and well detailed while still having the ability to have a nice amount of FPS. It presents a really nice attention to detail, being able to notice every action from the character's movement to the weapons firing and even to the trajectory of the grenades being thrown, people even write things on walls with the bullet holes.

One of the most important aspects of this game is sound and Valve didn't miss a thing in it.
You can tell just by the sound where your enemy is and on what material he's running and with the recent updates to the weapons' sounds, it just got even more realistic.
The existence of Music Kits help the game music wise, adding a completely custom Main Menu music and in game sound effects change that can be chosen by any player according to their taste.

Playing this the competitive way like I did, I don't consider it a big time consuming game since a single competitive match takes about 1 hour to finish if it's a ""close"" one, while a match that you're completely mowing your opponents can take about 15 minutes. It's not an addicting game, you will still be able to have a life while playing this game.

I recommend this game 100% It's a whole new experience learning new things about this game, playing with different people from all around the world and just having fun. Many players have said that it's easier playing other FPS games if you first learned playing CS:GO an then moved to other games instead of the other way around.",True

Ingredients:
1. 6 tablespoons unsalted butter
2. 1/2 cup white sugar
3. 1/2 cup brown sugar
4. 1/4 cup water
5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon
6. 1 pinch salt
7. 5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced
8. 1 pastry for double-crust pie 

Directions:
1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.
3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.
4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.
5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.
6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing.",True

The show focuses on Cory Baxter, who moves from San Francisco, California to Washington, D.C. with his father, after Victor Baxter gets a new job in the White House as the official head chef. The series marks a Disney Channel first, as it is the channel's first spin-off. This is also the only Disney Channel spin-off series to be broadcast in standard definition for the entire length of the show. Reruns of the series have not been produced on Disney Channel, or on Disney XD; however they continue to air on the Family channel in Canada. Raven-Symoné guest-starred, reprising her role as Raven Baxter in one episode. In 2014 Disney Channel started airing a weekly block called Disney Replay on Wednesdays nights, during which episodes of Cory in the House air alongside That's So Raven and Kim Possible, among others.

9318,"Well after 600+ hours of playing this game it should be easier to write a better Review than 9/10 most Gametime in fewest time.

Now to the actual review:

Counter Strike Global Offensive or in the community the so called ""CSGO"" is a first person tactical shooter. 

I first played it in the Winter of 2016 and didn't really likeit.
 -Why?
Because I wasn't familiar with the gunplay and all the tactics. It was a difficult start in which someone had to force me to play. As I reached level 3 the fun began to rise. This was because I played against players on my skill level. So it was fair, not like the usual ""Casual"" Mode in which i first was forced to play.

After 200 hours I somehow got the gunplay right but still not perfect and now I'm still learning the grenade tactics and also still the gunplay. It isn't anymore like: ""I want to shoot down an apple from a head and hit the foot of my teammate standing 5 meters away"" but more like: ""I want to shoot down the apple and hit the body"".

Also there are cheaters but in my time playing the game I didn't encounter that many. The bigger problem are the smurfs here which got more seldom (At least for me).

If you look at my friends reviews you will see that they wrot a review about the game in which they don't recommend it. Mostly this is because they were toxic sometime because of not getting anything done. There also are these moments for me but I mostly blame myself and not the others which helps me with my aggression at those times and you should too. 

So for conclusion:

CSGO is a game which is hard to like at the start but easy to love after learning it. It is hard to learn and hard to master. But still fun when you finally can play in competetive. Cheaters and Smurfs are there but not as much as you would think.

The game has it's problems (e.g.: 32 tick Servers, microtransactions and bad cheat detection) but still it is fun to play.



I want end this review with a request:

Please don't be toxic.
You will only destroy the fun for yourself and your teammates.
If you are toxic take a break and do something else. (e.g.: playing Barbie Games that should help)

Updated 2/15/2017 - Game Optimization became worse for AMD users, severe stutters/fps loss when killing an enemy or randomly at any time within a map. after various updates recently the lag is increased. Previously I used to get 125 fps lock (from Raedon settings) but now it never goes above 100 fps at the same settings (Maxed 1080p) and instead drops to 20-40 randomly in game.

9366,"This is one of those games that you see and think 'How are people enjoying this?'.
I was exactly the same a couple years back; before I spent some time playing it. Originally, I was doing what a typical FPS player would do, running and gunning, hoping for the best. Only after around ~100 hours did I start getting into watching streamers and professional matches. This is when I became inspired to become better. 

As of now, I've played just over 2000 hours, making this (probably) my most played game. Ever.
It's given me so many memories of joy, relief and heartbreak. But one of the best things it has given is friends. And I don't mean this in the sense that I was completely alone before playing this but that I've gotten to know them so well and have met up with some of them now to go to a CSGO Major. I get frustrated at the game sometimes, blaming others but it is still easily one of my all time favourite games. I may find a new game. One that I enjoy more than this, but I will never forget the memories and friendships that CSGO has given me.

9405,"Ever wanted to play CSGO? well I'm about to tell you the very basics of CSGO.
In Counter Strike: Global Offensive there are 2 sides

Counter Terrorists and Terrorists, the Counter Terrorists have to win the round by either
killing all the Terrorists, running down the clock, or defusing the bomb.
The Terrorists have to win the round by either killing all the Counter Terrorists or planting
and exploding the bomb. There is also another Hostage gamemode that no one plays because it is
shit.
both of these teams have different items and
weapons, and unlike other games, you have to buy them. I won't get into the value
of everything ever in this video I'll just tell you the basics

For the Terrorist your options are the Galil AR, a 2000 dollar rifle that has
good tapping power, alright close range sprays but if you take this any longer
range than half a block then you're going to have some problems.
The 2700 AK-47, this is your bread and butter in CS, the AK is to CS what
the acoustic guitar is to music, if you want to get into the business, this is what
you should at least know the basics of. It's got amazing tapping power mid to long range
but the spray is wild, but you can learn to control it, I'll tell you about that later.
Basically the Ak-47 is a heavy duty assault rifle that'll cut through everything.

And for the Counter Terrorists we have the FAMAS, M4A1-S and the M4A4

The FAMAS cost 2250 and has 2 firing modes, burst and automatic, with burst you get incredibly
high accuracy on the first shot, but you need to wait half a second between each 3 bullet
burst. Automatic is best if you're trying to run somewhere, being able to fire more than
3 bullets will save your life, you can right click to change between these modes, and if you
pick up the FAMAS from a dead enemy, you can check the bottom right, just below your ammo
if it's in burst or automatic.

The M4A1-S is a highly accurate rifle with a silencer that removes the tracers your bullets
usually give, and it has a very easy to control spray, but is neudered by the fact that it only
has 20 bullets per clip and only 2 extra clips, amounting to a grand total of 60 bullets.

The M4A4 is as accurate sa the M4A1-S, and does as much damage but doesn't have the silencer,
so why do I prefer the M4A4? I spray a lot, because I've learned the spray patterns, so the 30
bullet clip and the way more reserve ammo allows me to worry a lot less about running out of ammo
It took 10 kills in warmup for me to run out of ammo on the M4A4 for the first time EVER.

Both the M4A4 and the M4A1-S both cost 3100 dollars and do less damage than the 2700 dollar
Ak-47. Why is this?

Because the Counter Terrorist side is an easier side to play on, you are playing defensively
and you don't have to be very clever to hold angles and tell where the enemy is, but at least
you don't have to buy helmets because the Ak-47 chews through it anyway, the only time you should
buy helmet is when you know the enemy has SMGs or Pistols, which can 1 hit kill you without a
helmet, so look out for that.

In addition to all of this, Counter Terrorist's Molotovs have a stupid and hard to spell name
And they cost 600 dollars, to contrast the Terrorist's Molotovs do more damage, and cost 400
dollars.

Once the bomb is planted, the remaining Terrorists have to hold the bombsite long enough for it
to explode, and the Counter Terrorists, depending on what the team's money is, what weapons they
are currently holding, and how many there are left after the bombplant have to do one of a few things

1. Retake the bombsite

This is if the people on your team who was holding the bombsite the bomb was planted at (normally
2 players) managed to take down 2 of the Terrorists on their way into the bombsite before they died.
And if you are holding a bombsite, your job is to stop the bombplant from going down with your life
never let the bomb go down, if you are holding a bombsite and they are planting, try your very best
to rush in there and take it. Now the job of the remaining players, who at this point are 3v3, is to
get back into the bombsite, which is a lot like the Terrorists taking the bombsite initially, and
defuse that bomb. Which is why you have to buy a defuse kit, because it normally takes 10 seconds
to defuse a bomb, doesn't sound like much, but a lot can happen in 10 seconds, a defuse kit cuts
that time in half, and if you manage to kill all of the Terrorists and defuse the bomb, your team
wins the round and the person who got 1 kill and defused gets the ""Most Valuable Player"" star.

2. Go for exit frags

This is if the people who were holding the bombsite went down without getting anything, and your
economy (your team's average money) is enough for a full-buy next round regardless, you set your
remaining 2-3 players on the exits to the bombsites and try and kill the enemy

3. Save

This is if the people who were holding the bombsite went down without getting anything, and your
economy is dogs bollocks. You hide in some distant and obscure part of the map hoping the Terrorists
don't hunt you down and kill you and steal your weapon.

Now you know all there is to know about the basics of the basics, now I'll tell you the VERY basics
of economy

If you win a round and then lose the next, force the next round, if you lose that too, eco, and then
on the next round, you can full buy. This is called the WarOwl buying guide.

Here's the reasoning behind it, and there's a bit of math coming now so buckle up.

If you lose 1 in a row you get 1400 dollars, now let's assume you lost in a buy round and you were
left with around 200-800 dollars after everyone had finished buying, this will leave you with around
1600 to 2200 the following round, this is not enough for a buy, or is it? Of course not, you force
buy this round so you can get 1900 next round, or win the round which gives you 3250, and considering
you just won a round and then lost, their economy isn't exactly fantastic.

If you lose the force buy, you've lost 2 in a row and you have 1900, if you full eco at this time
you will have 4300 for next round because the lose 3 in a row bonus is 2400, and if you lose again,
it's 2900, and then it maxes out at 3400. In addition if you're Terrorist and you plant the bomb
and lose, the planter gets an additional 300 bucks, as well as his team and himself gets 800 dollars
at the end of the round. But if you save as a terrorist you will get 0 extra money for the next round.

Now that's all you really need to know about CSGO that you probably didn't already know.

9464,"Where do I begin...?

After 2,000+ hours in this game, I have been in countless situations including: smurfs, hackers, toxic players, extreme try-hard players, trolls, and non-skilled players. So, here we go.



If you are a person who can ignore the community and its toxicity:

You will absolutely love this game! I don't have any reason to hate towards this game. The graphics for CS:GO are great for 'bad' computers and computers with insane capabilities. 
Learning the game is the hard, fun part. Every time you login, you may learn how to throw a helpful smoke grenade, or a new position for planting the bomb. 
The best part...clutching. The heart-racing moment when you are the last one alive against two or more enemies. Once you pull off an insane clutch, you learn more about your own, improving skill every single time.



If you can't ignore the community:

You might have a hard time with this game. 

You will encounter 'smurfs' (higher ranked people playing on a lower ranked account) that will tear your game into shreds. 
Hackers (this one is pretty obvious), the people who spin at insane speeds popping heads off where ever you go. This includes the people who can see through walls. 
Try-Hard players, the people who yell at you for not being good enough and ""causing your team to lose"". They may even get upset with the opponent team because they are doing well.
Toxic players (yep, the ones who get upset at the drop of a hat), if you speak, type, play, or breath incorrectly, you arise the Hulk out of them.
Then you have the trolls/derankers (the people trying to get their accounts to a lower rank by purposely losing the game), team killing, mic spamming, and 'knife only' players. *If you have a troll in your game, it is usually (90% of the time) game over.
Last, you have the non-skilled players. These guys decided to play on a higher ranked account even though they may be two-five ranks lower and play horribly. You usually don't encounter these people, but they are out there. (e.g. a gold nova master ranked player playing on a supreme master first class ranked account).



CONCLUSION:

This game is very enjoyable and can lead you meeting many new friends. However, there are people who want to ruin the game for you and your fellow teammates. The community is probably up on the scale next to League of Legends, but that is a story for another day. You will rarely get one ""good game"". 

One more thing...
If you are new to Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, you may have people telling you ""don't play competitive until you are good enough"". After going through the war-zone of casual and death match, you will be experienced enough to start playing to earn your rank. Play ""OFFLINE WITH BOTS"" until you are comfortable with playing real competitive games. 
Who knows, you may be part in the next generation of global elites. I mean, we all started somewhere.",True

Map design : 9/10
Maps are designed very well. New maps are added sometimes to keep the gameplay fresh.

Ranking system: 8/10
You are awarded a rank based upon personel skill level, not hours played.
Problem here is that some players with loads of hours create an alternate ""smurf"" acount to destroy noobs.
This somewhat destroys the ranking system.

Rewards from playing the game are skins for the weapons, not weapons itself.
This means that everyone has the same weapons and thus the same chance of winning.

It offers many game modes such as demolition, competitive (ranked games), death match and causal. Although the economy is way up there T^T I still appreciate the raw gameplay that csgo offers its fans. With constant updates from buffing or nerfing guns to introducing new operations cs go is nonetheless a prized jewel on steam. Double the experience by playing with friends as you begin your journey to become THE GLOBAL ELITE. *cough *cough I recommend this game to everyone. Even if you're a new comer to the cs franchise or an old fan who has played 1.6 and source WELCOME AND HAVE FUN! 10/10 (Hall of Fame)",True
9625,awesome game. will never die out and get boring xD,True
9626,"When you play this game on ranked mod, is very funny.",True
9627,"First and foremost, as this is a review, I should tell you the bottom line:

Do I recommend CS:GO? Absolutely.

That said, know what you are getting into. Counter Strike: Global Offensive is a highly competitive game filled with some of the biggest assholes you'll ever meet, some of the most braindead people you'll ever meet, and maybe two people who are actually decent human beings per week, but almost never in the same lobby.

It's best to bring your repetoire of Call of Duty-loving friends and have them sit through the torture of learning spray patterns and getting destroyed by smurfs with you, rather than braving the harsh world of the internet alone. Together, so long as you don't become too consumed in your competitive rankings, most every match will be an enjoyable experience filled with accidentally shooting one friend in the face, while the other bounces a flashbang off your big toe, and the other one spins in spawn to eat some sunflower seeds or grab his hotpockets as your random shouts at you in russian/spanish or complains about his ping.

Personal experience is a bitch.

Also be prepared to be subject to Valve's changing whims on how the game should be played. One week we're just fine, polishing our skills and getting ready for tournaments, and the next we get the ""Winter Update!"" in which the only good thing comes in the form of chickens wearing sweaters while you deal with the cons of a severely overpowered revolver a-la Clint Eastwood being added into the game, the rifle spray patters suddenly becoming luck of the draw, and pistols, known for good moving accuracy, suddenly being twice as inaccurate. 

On the bright side, they fixed the revolver in 2-3 days, and it only took them about a week to notice that everybody was preparing their StatTrak™ Pitchfork|Slaughter(s) to march down to Valve HQ and have a word with the design team.

As far as pros go:

- Feel rewarded for tactical play 10x more than Call of Duty or similar shooters
- Actually have to strategize and learn to use some skill by learning spray patterns that reward you for being good instead of lucky... most of the time
- Scum it up with a P90 or an Auto and watch the world burn as the people whose very existence you hate get their panties in a bunch
- Pretty Pretty skins for the low cost of an arm and a leg (and your right kidney if you're into StatTrak™)
- Feel rewarded for climbing a ranked ladder in a world where smurfs and hackers run rampant
- Uh..... 
- There's gotta be something.....
- I swear....
- OH RIGHT!
- Listen to ""Run"" every time the bomb is about to go off by buying a music kit. That's worth the game right there.

Sad/Angry moments include: When you get destroyed 16-0, When your teammate AFKs, When the enemy has a hacker(This happens more often than it should), When your teammates mic spam.

1) Waste an endless amount of money on pixels.
2) Speak russian.
3) Hate russians.
4) Cry.
6) Never seen the sunlight since I bought it.

9668,"I am a terrorist with a simple lifelong dream

To plant a C4 bomb with my 5-strong team

So I got in a queue and waited my turn

Till it was time for my match to confirm

So as the game loaded in I shook with anticipation

Until shrieks of 'cyka' destroyed my feeling of elation

For to my dismay I'd been matched with a clan

Of russian patriots who were stalin's biggest fan

So as the warmup ended they declared 'RASH B'

Their microphones obnoxious and loud as can be

But as they stood in spawn with the timer counting down

On the clan leader's face there began to form a frown

He glared into my eyes with his crosshair on my head

And asked me if I'm russian, for if I'm not I should be dead

But as I replied 'da' I knew I was in a trap

As him and all his mates started spouting russian crap

And I didn't understand a word so I just stood there and waited

Knowing when the round started I was going to be baited

When I found myself alone in tunnels I knew I'd been tricked

But as they rushed out long their leader got picked

So they all crouched in pit with their A rush dream shattered

Not to mention their comrade, whose brains had been splattered

Then along came an enemy with aimhacks and walls

And the russians screamed 'CYKA, THIS GAME SUCKS BALLS'

So they abandoned the match and I was left all alone

With a team of dumb bots who were sadly quite prone

To rush CT spawn with a bizon SMG

And I thought to myself; That's enough CS for me.

So I was playing a game and I HONESTLY got kicked for team damage, It wasn't intentional, I hate trolling in the game but it was fine seeing how it was only a 30 minute ban. I join a match a few days later with someone I've met on one of my games (good guy good player(I thought)) after I just made it to nova 3 I get stuck with 4 teams in a row that are intentionally thowing the match so it deranked me to nova 1 and if you play this game you know that getting out of silver is a M#!@$ F$#@ING B#&*% G%D D###IT so I was fed up at this point that the community really wants to play the competitive gameplay this way. So I asked this friend I met to play a match with me so I would have a better chance of not getting a A sh#t team because I f#cking hate sh#t people that do it on purpous and I think they are a bunch of c#nts for doing it. HE ENDED UP DOING THE SAME $&^#$#Y$&(#^@$(^#@($&^#@(*^ DO YOU GET THE POINT? HE SINGLE HANDEDLY RIPPED THE LAST NERVE FROM MY BODY AND WHEN I ASKED IF THEY WOULD KICK ME BECAUSE I PERFORM BETTER WITH A LOYAL TEAM THAT HAS SHREDS OF DIGNITY TO F#CKING ACTUALLY PLAY THE GAME THE WAY IT'S INTENDED TO BE PLAYED SO I PLAYED MY 20 YEAR OLD HEART OUT AND I COULDNT BEAT THE OTHER TEAM ON MY OWN. I JUST COULNT DO IT AND MY TEAMATES WERE SPAMMING CHAT AND I DIDN'T EVEN TRY TO STOP OR ANTAONIZE THEM BECAUSE I DIDNT WANT IT WORST FOR ME. SO I MUTED THEM AND ONCE THE GAME WAS 2-15 I WAS LIKE F#CK IT AND I JUST THREW A MOLITOV AT MY SH#T TEAM BECAUSE I JUST KNEW... I JUST F#CKING KNEW THAT I WAS ABOUT TO BE DERANKED BACK TO THE SH#TTY LIFE AS SILVER ELITE C#NTSTER SO I GOT KICKED FOR A DAY WHICH I DON'T EVEN FEEL LIKE I REALLY DESERVED BUT F#CK WHERE CAN JUSTICE BE SERVED IN THIS SCENARIO???? GUESS WHAT IT CANT so I waited the whole day... then I got a group of friends from my town on and we played 1 match and I was preocupied so I didn't do to great. Well the time came around late at night (This actually happened 30 minutes before I posted this) We play half a game and I'm having fun in my favorite game for once in a good minute again. We're talking on skype having a good time then out of no where... game lags... i'm in the main menu with a message "" AN ISSUE WITH YOUR SH#T COMPUTER IS BLOCKING THE VAG STSTEM. YOU CANNOT F#CKING PLAY UNTIL YOU RESOLVE THIS STUPID ISSUE WHICH MAY OR MAY NOT BE OUR G#D D#MN FAULT... SO AT THIS POINT I AM SCRAMBLING EVERYTHING I CAN DO I DISABLED MY FIREWALL, I RESTARTED STEAM THEN WENT AS FAR AS TO RESTART MY COMPUTER AND WITH SECONDS TO SPARE NONE OF THIS WORKED AND GUESS WHAT ELSE BECAUSE YOU'VE BEEN HAVING SH#T LUCK AND YOU'VE JUST HAD A BAD WEEK ON THIS GAME YOU SHOULDNT F#CKING PLAY IT FOR ANOTHER WEEK AND RECIEVED A WEEK BAN. I'VE PLAYED IN THIS GAME 150+ HOURS AND THIS SH#T HAS NEVER HAPPENED TO ME. IT INSTANTLY REDIRECTED ME TO A WEBSITE WHEN THE PROBLEM FIRST AROSE. BUT I DID NOT READ IT BECAUSE I HAD 5 STUPID MINUTES TO GET THIS SH#T DONE. THE WEBSITE ENDED UP SUGGESTING THIS SAME SH#T I TRIED +1 MORE HELPFUL HINT WHERE IT WOULD TAKE ME AT LEAST 2 MINUTES TO TRY THIS LAST STEP WHICH IS GO TO YOU'RE RUN MENU sorry I dont know why i'm still yelling in my head... anyways it asked me to type a command in which would repair steam. But I didn't even have enough time to try to fix the issue before my favorite thing to do told me you can't do it again for a week. In my eyes.. I think it was F#CKING SH#TTY AS F#CK and it just wasn't fair . Overall the game is good. I like it... play it every day.

9777,"This game is amazing. Its the best fps out there. You guys have to understand that the game is extremely hard. You wont get your first kill in the first 5 min. i got mine in the first 30 min >-<.

EDIT 5 YEARS LATER:

This game is ok. It's still one of the best fps games out there. Incredibly fun game at lan parties! You and your friends will create moments that you will remember forever. On the other side, this game will bring you down. It's toxicity gets to even the strongest men out there; If you think you can take it, go ahead. But be warned. They will take you. Anyway, the game has another issue: The ""bell curve."" This game's ranking system is supposedly based off of a bell curve distribution, putting most players at around the gold nova rank. This is blatantly untrue: I have 30+ friends who play CSGO and not a single one of them is a gold nova. We all lie in the silver ranks. In addition, it is extremely hard to climb out of the silver ranks due to cheaters and smurfs. This is nothing new. You have to put in serious dedication to climb out. If you do, in fact, climb out of silver, You will be left feeling accomplished: but not for long, as the grind will return for you.

In conclusion, this game is a BLAST with buddies!! The problem is the ranking system, which is not accurate in determining your actual skill level. Don't let your competitive skill rank bring you down; You know your better than that and prove yourself worthy. Go be a killer in retake; Dominate in surf servers; Excel in bhop. 

Oh yea, did i forget to mention? Shooting people is have the game in this fps. Community servers are the BEST, if not THE BEST. True men will embrace the opportunity to learn surf and bhop, and will take themselves to new levels in gameplay. This is for me one of the funnest factors of CSGO.

My rating is not based on game play it is real smooth however, I had rated it a bit low due to the fact people are so driven into the CS:GO market it's not even funny; it looks to me as if the thing is a bad addiction and I state as merely my opinion that the fate of CS:GO market is worse than death, heck If I gambled in real life I would have a better chance.

But you do have the option not to be driven into the market if you are not tempted by 2 dollar offers.

9834,"Perhaps the greatest Tactical shooter ever created, next to its predecessors CS:S and 1.6. 
Counter-Strike: Global Offensive requires hours of dedication, but there is n0thing(pun) more satisfying, than your first headshot, than your first ace, than your first 1v5 ace clutch. After putting in the effort, the game will reward you for your hard efforts, not only in rank gaining, but in skill too. Spray control is perhaps, one of the toughest things in competitive gaming, or gaming alone. And while the learning curve to master the spray control with each gun is insanely difficult, even learning the spray control on the AK or the M4 is an amazing feeling. This game is one in which, you put in the time and the effort, and you will greatly benefit from it. That is why I r8 CS:GO a gr8 8/8 no h8 just appreci8 and masturb8 to its cr8tion.

9842,"This game saved my life.

I am 42.

My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and adopted our son together. They are now both 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I found myself lost and miserable. I was self destructive. I got so mad one day from everything spiraling out of my control that I punched some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion. That caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand... my working hand... my games hand.. the hand that I held and carried my children to bed with.. The hand I desperately needed to make sure I could continue to provide.

After learning of the severity of my self-inflicted damage, I was borderline suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety. I have never had fits of rage, or been one to break down and cry, but I was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side.

Having nothing better to do, I searched for a game I could play, ONE HANDED while I recovered. I somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews. I decided that it had to be worth a shot... I must admit, I didn't beat the game, or play nearly as long as some of you. In fact, I may have only played this game a day or two.. With that being said, after doing so, I had a new found joy and hope for life. I was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me. I was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness. I was able to see the fruits of my ""labor"". I relaxed for 5 ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ minutes to this music long enough to realize that I was going to be okay.

After coming to that realization, I turned the game off, and I went back to work. It hurt my hand like hell but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself, and I became the father I needed to be in that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving as.

Today, I am close friend with my kids mother. We don't fight, or argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents, and friends.

I now have 3 kids. My third child is, wait for it, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my own separation, and we just stumbled in to each others life unexpectedly. We have been in a relationship for a year now, and are very happy together.

Moral of the story, you never know what life holds in store for you, and if I would have given up when all the odds were stacked against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

Thank you",True

The amount of time and money I've put into this game is very sad hence the state the game is in now.  Hackers are at an all time high, the hitreg, hitboxes, and community itself is trash (sometimes I disagree, but most of the time it is).  Valve was heading in the right direction updating the game after it was released.  The only thing saving CS:GO is the skins and the fact it is still being considered an MLG tournament game.  Weapon skins were nice, but new sounds, the R8 (pre-nerf), glove skins, and map revamps (Inferno) were not needed at all.  I still love CSGO, but I'm saddened to say it is nothing like it was when it came out 5 years ago.

The game feautres alot of important aspects to the game that a lot of games don't example (spray control,movement and so on) so the reason why i recommend this game is becouse it is worth those 11€ hell id pay even more my point is that this game is worth every euro you pay for it expecialy due to the growing comunitiy and all the workshop skins. I recommend this game becouse it is fun and verry competitive i find my self playing this game more than any other game in the world even a better side to it is that you can play it even on a potatoe computer like mine so yea this game rocks buy it now you won't regret it. :D",True

9920,"My most played game, with almost 1700 hours at the time of this review. A very fun, time consuming game that is not pay 2 win. Although there is a skin system, they do not effect your playing, just for customization. It consists of 3 main gamemodes (w/ 2 other gamemodes that nobody plays) Competitive, which you will be playing a lot of, a 5v5 first to 16 rounds. This game is based off an ingame economy, where you must manage your money during each round and decide what weapon you can afford, or if you're willing to glass cannon an awp. The next gamemode is Deathmatch. Deathmatch is up to a 10v10 literal deathmatch where players spawn randomly around the map. Different weapons give different amounts of points, and the player with the most points by the end of the 10 minute round wins. This gamemode is very good for warming up or practicing. The last gamemode is Casual, up to a 10v10 game where it's first to 7 rounds. It is very similar to competitive except for the fact that it's 10v10, and also you automatically start with armor, meaning you don't have to buy it like you do in competitive. The other 2 gamemodes are demolition and arms race, arms race in which you cycle through all the weapons by getting 2 kills, and demolition is basically competitive, but for all the kills you get each round you upgrade your weapon and also potentially gets you grenades to use for the next round. Demolition and Arms Race are very unpopular, and I would recommend Casual and Deathmatch over them. 

Rounds:

Each round consists of the Terrorists (T's) and Counter-terrorists (CT's). The CT's job is to defend a bombsite in gamemodes Casual, Competitive, and Demoliton, and fend off the attacking T's, who must plant the bomb in the designated area, eliminate all the CT's, or have the bomb explode. If the bomb is planted, CT's must defuse it to win the round. There is a very rare gamemode that you'll almost never play in low ranks, which is Hostage. In Hostage, T's must defend hostages and prevent the CT's from extracting them to a location.

Weapons:

Counter-Strike:Global Offensive consists of 2 main rifles, the M4A1-S/M4A4 (You can choose between either) and the AK-47. The M4's are for the CT's, and the AK for the T's. The AK-47 is a very powerful rifle, and I would recommend tap firing at long range in the head, because the AK is an automatic 1-shot in the head, no matter what range. All weapons have recoil, and to get better, you must master these, and be able to spray accurately. Every automatic weapon has a unique spray pattern and you'll need to compensate for recoil when spraying by pulling down. The AK-47 is $2700, while the M4's are both $3100. There is also 1 main sniper rifle, the AWP, a powerful 1-shot anywhere from the waist up. The AWP can penetrate the thick walls giving you an advantage. The AWP is $4750, making it the most expensive weapon in the game at it's current state. If you can use it right, you can make it worth it's hefty price. Keep in mind, moving while shooting is not viable with rifles or snipers, and your accuracy will pay the price for running while moving. However, there are other weapons, such as the SMGs, the MP9(CT), MAC-10(T), MP7, UMP-45, P90, and PP-Bizon. The PP-Bizon is complete shit, unless you can hit the headshots, which can barely 2 shot a player in the head at close range with armor. The MP9 and MAC-10 are counterparts, and are both viable while running and gunning. Then there's the shotguns, with the MAG-7(CT), Sawed-Off(T), Nova, and XM1014. The MAG-7 is a CQ shotguns to hold corners. Awards you with a good amount of money per kill. The XM1014 is a scumbag weapon, an automatic close-medium range shotgun. The MAG-7's T counterpart the Sawed-Off is complete shit, that nobody should use except for JW. Then there's the meme weapons, the Machine Guns. The M249 and Negev are shit and don't ever use them. There are also pistols, which you automatically spawn with at the start of each round, the USP-S/P20000(CT) and the GLOCK-18(T) The GLOCK excels at close to medium range, with a secondary burst fire mode, where you fire 3 bullets almost simultaneously. This is only viable in very tight spaces and while holding a corner. The USP-S and P20000(P2K) are basically the same, but the P2K has 13 shots in a clip, while the USP has 12. The USP is slightly more accurate, while the P2K is practically the same, but more ammo. The P250 is a great eco gun, that can close range 1-shot headshot armored opponents, with 13 shots in a clip. If you can aim, this gun is for you. If you can't aim, I would recommend the TEC-9 (T aka Rek-9) and Five-Seven(CT) They're both high ammo guns that you can fire as fast as you can click, with a 1-shot headshot on armored opponents, at close to medium range. The CZ-75 is the Five-Seven's counterpart, which has 2 clips of 12 bullets, but is automatic, good for close range, as it can spray down enemies. I would recommend the Five-Seven, as it is easy to use, while the CZ you must manage you're ammunition and hit your shots more often. There are also the dualies, which are pretty shit unless you can aim for the head at CQ, but are usually just for meme strats, like the NiP crabwalk. I wouldn't really use them, as they are like the Rek-9 and Five-Seven except do much less damage and armor penetration. Then, there's the Juan Deag. This skillful weapon can only be viable if you can aim very well. The Desert Eagle is known for it's crisp Juan Deags that can take out almost any oppenent with 1 shot to the head. If you can use it right, you can kill everyone while also looking like a complete badass. - Señor Juan Deag 
Last but not least, the Famas(CT) and Galil(T). The Famas and Galil are almost neck and neck, as they are counterparts and are only a $200 difference. Both are viable, not as an M4 or AK, with 2 shots to the head against armor, but pretty good. If you can't afford an M4 or AK with armor, the Famas/Galil is for you.

Maps:

CS:GO consists of a shitload of maps, but the only map you'll be playing if you're in silver is Dust II, which is a very iconic map that goes back to CS 1.1, as it takes place in a Middle-Eastern area. The other somewhat played maps are (in no particular order) Mirage, Overpass, Cobblestone, Inferno, Train, Cache, and Nuke. Recently, Nuke and Inferno got a reskin, and look fresh, but Nuke is very dead map and most feel like it was changed too much.

CS:GO is a fun game, with 18 different ranks that you can rise up to, and challenge the best. I will say, it is very hard to get out of silver, unless you're doing very good in your placement matches. Make sure you're ready for competitive, as if you quit in the middle of a match, timeout, lagout, or disconnect that you're willing to take at the least a 30 minute competitive match ban or up to a 7 day ban. *There is team damage in competitive, and you can get banned for killing or doing too much damage to teammates*. Try your hardest and make sure you know the game before doing your placement matches, as once you achieve a rank, you may become stuck at the rank for quite a while. To rankup, you need to focus on MVP's. Kills, Deaths, Assists, and time played does not effect you're possibility to rankup.",True

9982,"How to CS:G0:

1) Buy the game
2) Get a skin as a drop
3) Think that skins are amazing and waste lots of money on skins (more than you brought the game for)
4) Get a case as a drop
5) Try to open case with tiny, weak, puny hands
6) Realize that you need a key to open the case
7) Buy a key
8) Open case and get sh*t
9) Cry and realize you need to open more cases
10) Spend all your pocket money on cases and keys
11) Still get sh*t
12) Sell all your skins for more cases and keys
13) Get a red and then sell the red to buy more cases and keys
14) Get sh*t and cry
15) Actually try playing competitive
16) Get crappy silver rank
17) Devote your life to getting a rank like MG I or something like that
18) Take the mic out of crap silvers
19) Make a smurf account
20) Smurf
21) Smurf
22) Smurf
23) Realize your smurf account is too high so start deranking it
24) Your profile now has at least 10 messages saying hacker
25) Go back onto main account thinking you are god
26) Play sh*t cause you spent ages playing with crappy silvers
27) Cry
28) Buy hacks
29) Become Global Elite
30) Get signed by Fnatic
