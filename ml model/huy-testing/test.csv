10025,"I played the game for 400 hrs at least in the online as of this.
now I did had my fun and all messing around for a tiny bit, but the amount of modders
and the lack of server is just terrible.

servers- most of the time I have to get matched inside chinese server despite the fact that I'm not even close to that region, the chinese have bots that haven't even been banned for a while, spamming the chat in chinese, the chinese players have lack of communication making it hard to even type as most of them are uneducated as it seems (for some reason it seems like many of them relate to the devil by spamming 666 and such) I just start to dislike them more and more.

modders: some can mind their on business and its nice, some of them go into rampage killing everyone or just in missions ruin the fun of actually having to do anything because they teleport and god mode and bullet explosive with minigun making your screen shake like the highest earth quake richter scale.

cash - as it is, payment in this game is pretty sad, as everything cost a huge amount and in my opinion the balance in payment in heists just doesn't add up, everything seems overpriced as to some of the luxury stuff that cost 10M which are for people to say ""yeah I bought it since I already have anything else"" I don't have huge problem with the cost of stuff, but just the payment of some missions are just terrible.

why I choose to bad text? well the story begins when I was roaming free roam with my vigilante and tons of my chars npc with green hair just started to spawn on my vigilante and I blew up from that, as soon as I respawned I saw ""(my name) killed (player)"" like all the server, I'M NOT MODDING but as soon as I saw all those deaths i just insta left the server, now my friend that was in the server said now someone else is killing all the server, not sure what it was, but oh boy how I knew I'll get ban for something I didnt even do, yup I got PERM BAN for something I didn't even do the funny thing is I can't even appeal for that, it's just a joke to play gta v now.",0

10042,"[h1]Overall GTA V[/h1] is a great game. With high definition and smooth lighting unlike the previous GTA IV. Its a good game with hours of fun. Great for modding too lol. The map is also very large vs the previous version and the cars are well designed even though rockstar tries not to copy the exact design of the cars in reality.

 [h1]I Played this game on[/h1]: [b]PS3 , PS4, and now PC[/b]. It’s really wonderful how rockstar Managed to build a world that really feels alive. Everytime I replay story mode, I have to remind myself that the characters are just video game characters and could not have been based on real experiences. It obvious has its flaws, like the slow devolution of GTA Online to a no-grinding-allowed scenario and the lack of expansion packs for story mode.

[h1]Story mode[/h1]
I love the online version on GTA 5 because it's more updated and more work is put to online than story mode.Witch is a problem for story mode players since they have litreally been playing the same game for about 4 years because they updated the game about 4 years ago but it was only to some new cars witch then makes it a minor update.But considering the fact that R* said that they where going to release a DLC for GTA story mode and then went on to cancel it in earlier 2019 must have to upset story mode players a lot.

10050,"As a player that plays the Online mode only, my advice is to invest a lot of your in-game time in finding reliable players to do missions with. The online mode is unplayable when you have to rely on strangers for things like heists. 

The multiplayer lobbies are saturated with modders, which can be annoying. Other than that, I'm happy that I made the switch from console to PC. The people are much less toxic and actually look out for each other. Sometimes.

8.5/10 would wait another 20 minutes to join a session

10052,"Fun with friends, can do a lot of stuff and don't get bored. I highly recommend playing it on winter when there is snow in lobby. Easy to get money and easy to spend it but there is bonus that you have spent a good time with friends.",1
10053,this game is not bad you can play it for hours and hours and have fun with your friends but it has a lot of bug,1
10054,"PROS:
-Story is excellent, modding single player is always fun.
-Online *can* be extremely fun, open world- especially with friends.
-Plenty of cars and customization for gearheads, as well as a variety of different weapons to choose from.
-Both easy and challenging missions/heists.
-Community can be go either way of being toxic or extremely fun.

CONS:
-Modders. If you play this game expect to run into some modders. Whether they're friendly or not is up to luck. They can either spawn in vehicles and be fun, or, give everyone money and destroy cargo you're trying to sell for some odd 100s of thousands of dollars. I meet one almost everyday. My suggestion is to play in an invite only session when you can, or, if you need a public lobby with only you, there are ways to make your own that google can help you find.
-Griefers. When you aren't getting harassed by a modder, you meet a griefer. There are people who will blow you up over and over until you go into passive mode, or that destroy your cargo. Note that these people don't get anything out of destroying it, except to just be mean. The excuse that the games tells them to doesn't make them less of an ding dong.
-Crashes. I'm not sure if this is due to modders or my own game, but sometimes, about once or twice a day I'll get the random crash and have to wait through the 10 minute loading screen. Note that modders can boot you out of a session and crash your game however.
EDIT: I haven't crashed as of recently, but I am still looking out for this one closely as I believe it is on Rockstar's side.
-Game age. While I admit I'm surprised to see this game as lively as it is right now, no game lasts forever. If GTA 6 has an online feature, gta 5 online won't be getting as many/if any updates and most of the playerbase will switch. So, if you're brand new it might not be worth the effort to get into a warzone as this, especially in it's current state.
-MK2 Oppressor. Do you think missiles are bad enough? What about jets? Now, imagine making a jet and compacting it into bike form. That's right, you have the oppressor mk2. A flying jet bike that can shoot missiles. One of the most adaptable, pretty fast vehicles in the game is also used for griefing. (For obvious reasons.) Anyone that plays gta should- maybe if needs one of these. While they are fun to move around in, they can also be very annoying.

This concludes my text of the game. As far as rating would go, I have a decent amount of fun on this game when I'm not being tormented by modders. If it were free of modders I would give it a 7 or 8 out of 10. In its current state however, I would say a 5 or 6. If you can make your own public lobbies then it isn't too much of a problem though. Thanks for reading. :) I would suggest getting the game IF IT IS ON SALE!!!!! and only if it is on sale, and trying it for the time steam allows you to before you can't refund it.

10082,"The entire game is just a gigantic mess to begin with as it's clear the game is just under a greedy publisher which I guess was evident from the existence of shark cards. What's worse is that the game forces you into one of two boats which is either A: Grind out the games content for money be attentive to when and where there are bonus money events. Or B: Just pay for shark cards. There's no real middle man for people who just pick up the game and want to play for fun. Like come on, just look at the store page IT HAS PURCHASE OPTIONS FOR IN-GAME CASH, SERIOUSLY MAN.
Terrible, truly terrible.

It's not just the absurdity of the price tag or the shark cards, it's also the absolute dogshit of a DRM that they've... Upgraded as of mid-late 2019, which I believe was partly responsible for consistent mid-game crashes regardless of what you were doing (the game would/will crash straight to desktop regardless of what you're doing.)

I think one of the highlights for me in all of my time spent playing this game, was when I wanted to mod the game. (Be prepared for a long story)
Now, admittedly I never get first installs right all the time whenever I'm modding a game that I have no experience in modding so respectively it's a bit of user error. As well as, I bought this game originally off of Greenmangaming, which didn't supply me with some sort of Steam code or anything and the installation itself was a tiny bit clunky, but it worked. 
None the less, I tried modifying the game files to have some obscure weapon mod from memory, I managed to fuck this up big time to the point where the game just didn't boot up at all. So as a result I just wiped my hard drive of any trace of the game, decided to reinstall in order for it to function.
So did it work?

Nope, it took a lot of screwing around with just to even function at all, and by the time I even had the game functioning, it was throwing me a DirectX error that I just didn't understand outside of ""DirectX something or rather here's a bunch of numbers you don't understand.""
So it was at this point I had given up all hope of trying to fix it myself, all of the error fix videos on youtube failed, Google supplied me with nothing helpful and, to rub it all in I was out of ideas.

In my infinite quest to try and make the game work, I filed a support ticket being the ABSOLUTE end of my road here to try and make the game work consistently for more than... 30 minutes at a time... 
At the time my specs weren't the best either but the game did in fact run perfectly prior to my failed modification.
(AMD 6300FX with a GTX 760, worked for a time, threw it out the window recently... Metaphorically speaking.)

Now, I told their customer support the exact details of what I did. ""I failed to mod the game, reinstalled the game can get it to function for 30 minutes at a time get a directX error."" And for some reason, EVEN WHEN I had told them ""the game ran PERFECTLY before this"" they opted for the easiest answer of them all.
""Check the game specifications.""

Needless to say, I bought the game on Steam at this point because neither the developer nor the software functioned properly for some reason.

tl;dr Player fails to mod game re-installs only for game to function 30 minutes at a time and gets told to ""get an upgrade"" by the developers.

So in spite of saying tons of negative stuff, do I have anything constructive/positive?
It's designed in such a simplistic manner that it being enjoyable to a monkey wouldn't be surprising at all. The guns use ray casting, (except when they don't do that for obvious reasons, Missile launchers ETC) the cars have unique handling characteristics that aren't actually too hard to get a mastery of. It's casual game, so it gets the usual casual stuff thrown at it. Don't expect be some 'professional racer' or some crap. Take this at your own whim as to whether or not you'd like it.

The Story was enjoyable, made sense where it should've (at times) and in it's typical fashion was comical at its best. But don't expect the story to hold a majority of the content, as you should ideally be playing the game for either the Online or Mods.

Honestly, if you've ever heard the whole ""it's about the journey not the destination"" then I think this games online component captures a bit of that. It's somewhat grindy and requires a high level of consistent attention to it, at least until the point where you're loaded. However this is dependant on you're outlook, as once you're loaded with cash you can spend it on stuff like A-10 warthogs, and other forbidden military/high tech hardware to kill players with. However bare in mind, this is only if you decide to go about it the hard way.

At it's peak Online is also entertaining when played with friends, as randoms actually make this game not only tedious but an absolute chore to play, so be sure you have people you know playing with you.
Of course there are instances where playing with randoms is your only option, but don't expect it to be 100% either or. Just bare in mind that in the instances where randoms are, they often add a high level of stupidity to the game often making osmium look far less dense by comparison, with comments like ""I can't do this without my minigun!""

Look even when I'm trying to find something positive say about this game, I really can't find anything other than ""if you're bored give it a go"" but honestly. Keep your 40 (AUD), as this game is just fucking horrible, and I'd only recommend playing it with friends. There's no legitimate reason to want to play something like this outside of that.",0

10084,"For the most part this game is pretty fun. When you finally get into a session, because that will take a while, you are greeted with a beautiful open world in which you can pillage, murder and mutilate (In that order). While the game itself is fun, it is also a ridiculous grind in order to get things. Most players end up modding or hacking it seems in order to get in game weapons, businesses and vehicles. Can I blame them? No. Am I one of them? I don't know if I should say. R* bans any and all players who are associated with hacking or hackers so its not really a great system and makes it hard to continue enjoying the game. Overall I would recommend this game, however don't get too invested or into the grind as you will never come out of it. You could likely never earn enough money to buy everything legitimately.",1

10104,"Best value for money spent on a game for me. There's literally so many activities to do in the game you simply won't get bored. Single-player is a must play if you haven't completed it yet. Once you're done, you might want to install mods - there are innumerable mods available online.

Although the mode that keeps the game alive is undoubtedly the online game-mode. It's been six years since the release of GTA V and the developers still provide the users with frequent content which is free of cost. Yes it does require some grinding to afford the luxuries provided in every update but that can be accomplished by playing heists with friends which has great story-line and gameplay. And when you're with friends, it simply does not bore you. Apart from that there are so many official and custom fan made playlists which you can play with upto 16 friends (or more, not sure).

10117,"This game sucks:
In the beginning there was nothing to but be mean so people cheated. My first cheating offense.
Heists came out only in special apartments making small apartments useless and extinct.
Heists required 4 people so it sucked but were kind of fun for the first 10 times. Only way to make money.
When special cargo came out it didn't pay enough for how much work went into it.
Vehicle cargo was to expensive if you spent all your money on special cargo and still didn't pay well.
Motorcycle club came out and it needed way to much work and had no scaling or value. The drugs took way to much supplying to get any sort of money out of it.
Bunkers came out and was ok.
Dooms day heists came and required only 2 people but the heists were not fun at all. Following a agent in a helicopter for 30 minutes while you are in a missile truck. Sounds cool but wasn't. you spend a whole day grinding the mission for ok pay only if you did it with the two people though.
Hangars looked cool but were to expensive to get. Never got to use them.
Arena workshop was a scam. no one played and it wasn't fun. It was just revamped game modes 
Nightclubs looked cool but didn't pay well and the fact that the terrorbyte was used to upgrade one vehicle and do small missions was doo doo.
Vehicles at this point succumbed to power creep. everything new had guns built in and were more armored and were quicker. Everything before it just became out dated and unneeded. 
At this point the grind for money just to pay my rent, fees, snacks, and armor were to much to bare with the need to get cool stuff. 
The money that you earn didn't have value unless you hired a real life finance manager to make sure you make a profit and use your time to the fullest just to get a building you will regret buying because you were to lazy to read or watch a video about what it did. 
Around this time the fact that players can suckle at the teat of modders just to make money bothered me. I couldn't bare the fuel someone's god complex because they spent 15 dollars on a mod menu. 
I just grew more and more angry at every little thing at this point thinking that everything was specially designed to make you want to play a 100 of dollars for 8 million in game cash. For what 8 million can buy you 1 thing.
I grew agitated so I got a menu from a friend and used the stealth cash option to get millions of dollars. This was me and 3 other friends finally having fun in this god forsaken game. I got to customize all the cool new things. I finally felt happy. Then after the 30 minutes of fun it landed. We were banned all four of us. I got hit the worst because of past bans when the game came out on xbox and you had to do an ip glitch. I was perma banned  After 800 hours of the awful game i finally had fun for 30 minutes and it gets deleted like that. No support ticket just to complain either. Bans are non negotiable. I report every modder I see and I bet their 15 dollar menu kept them safe and I use a menu and i got a small window of fun. 
Out of the 800 hours I have on this game I have only had 30 minutes of fun. Perma banned for finally having fun.
My 3 other friends don't get perma banned but their characters are completely reset. No sense in playing after that point except to cheat again. Another way of making you spend more money.

10125,"GTA V represents the video game branch at its best. Tense and dramatic when it wants to be so-and happy and surprising when the player wants it to be .

(it's 50-odd gig for a reason) I've had so many nights laughing my ass off at this game regardless of whether I'm winning or not.

The online part of the game is endless fun and hilarity if you can get over the initial complexity as there's just so much to do. Regular updates and additions even 5+ years after release. The community ain't bad either - if you can stomach CSGO this will be paradise in comparison.

The only downside I can think of is that running it on Linux still exacts a noticeable performance hit compared to native Windows, but it's still playable.",1

10154,"Have over 2000h online and I Can't give this game positive feedback because they don't deserve it. Have only 300h on record on steam for playing gta5, that is because I was playing the social club version first not steam. After some time I decided to switch on steam, had to buy another copy of gta5 so I can text GTA online mode. Basically bought this game twice for the same account so I can have gta5 in the steam library with all stats and progress saved. The Story mode is fantastic no argument about it. In another hand, Online mode is still broken. Innocent players still getting banned for no reason at all. Modders still roaming in online mode. I merged from SC to Steam just to make a text about terrible online gta5. A Few years back got banned because modder force-feeds me with 2.5m. Was LVL90 I had to delete my character so I can start from scratch. Since then R* customer support is shit. You always typing with a bot that is scripted to type every time the same shit. I am LVL 500 online and I don't know if and when I will be banned again. Modders in online can frag you as a cheater that result in online Ban. Note to my steam friends don't buy this game is not worth it. Just download the pirate version much safer for your wallet. Their customer support is 0   not even trying to help back. Don't bother buying shark cards they will not help, you can still get bananed. They should make Gta with the story mode only for a cheaper price, and GTA 5 + online for a regular price. Believe me when I say all those negative feedbacks are not from hackers themselves. Innocent players wasted lots of time online and got hammered by C0ckstar. Avoid this game in online mode, not safe for your pc either your privacy. You have been warned.",0

But if you want more fun, action & colorful story and game Grand Theft Auto V is for you
Single Player side
-It is good overall but except the cop AI (It was better in Grand Theft Auto IV)
Now let's see the Online side of it
I do not like Online a lot, here is why:
-Unbalaced Economy (some cars are overprice or OP)
-Connecting to servers are too slow 
-Chinese dudes(they spams chinise letters when they are joining or leaving, and mostly Cheating)
-Servers player capacity is 32 i think for a massive openworld game 32 is too low

You can't hate them, but you also can't like them to a point where you would want to see them in another game. Lamar was likable, I'll give him them that though.

10231,"One of the most complete open world games out there!
Story is enjoyable and so are most of the characters..
The city of Los Santos is like a mini version of California and I love playing in it! As an early 2010's game, it is way ahead of its then competitors..
Then there is multiplayer.. It's like a whole new game with different characters, objectives, missions and also slightly different gameplay optimized for co-op. There are some server issues and it required top notch system and internet for online, also there a a few mechanics that are a real pain in the butt, but overall the game experience is unlike any other!
This is one of those games that one never gets tired of playing!!

10278,"Sorry for my terrible English, but I try my best. 

 I am finally able to play this hidden gem from my library since I upgraded my PC a couple of months ago!:)
 I am a 90s Kid, so I knew GTA since I was a child and grew up with it, remember the good old days playing GTA San Andreas on my Playstation 2 with a Sheet of Cheat Codes written with a pencil in the Box of the game:D
Since Grand Theft Auto V is one of the most played and and even streamed games to this day, the text should have a higher level of criticism like the average Steam Game. 

The start was a bit bumpy for me. The first mission is a driving mission and I really don't like the vehicle handling in GTA V. It feels too extreme. For example when you drift a bit too much, your car will get compeltely out of control and you will often crash into other cars (other cars behave like moving bricks obstacles in a jump n' run game, doesn't feel very realistic too me). Even after a couple of hours, if you master your driving style and rush trought the traffic, it doesn't feel as satisfying as back in time, when you crush into other cars, it just feels annoying because you get out of flow and need to gain control of your car again. I prefere the old driving style which feels a bit more static and not that realistic, but it's just more pleasing for a video game (Like in ""Saints Row: The Third"" for example or the old Grand Theft Auto titles) Same goes for planes and helicopers. Just Cause 2 Multiplayer handled it even better in my opinion...

What I also don't like is that so much story happens during car driving. Yes, the game is called ""Grand Theft Auto"", but when they have such great radio channels like ""Radio Los Santos"" with some of my favourite rap artists, I wanna hear that A$AP Ferg, Ace Hood or The Game Song while driving the wrong way on a highway like 50mph too fast and feeling like a real OG in that stolen car and don't wanna listen to the dialogues which interrupt the music all time during missions (I cry everytime if the radio plays ""Work"" or ""Ali Bomaye"" and they just keep talking all the time... I really need to give big probs to the music chosen for the radio channels. If you drive throught Los Santos and there is a good song, you just feel it and don't wanna leave that car xD It's the thing I like the most of GTA V. I remember also saving the Radio Los Santos Playlist on Spotify a couple of years ago even thought I didn't played the game back then xD 
MUSIC: 10/10!!!

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cneusrgPYK0

Also the graphics look stunning for a game that is already 6-7 years old, specially the lightning, sun rises and sun sets. Beautiful. Altrought the character models and face expressions could be better, compared to nowadays standards. An Update or Patch would be fine.. Also the details, like dust in the dessert, animals next to the street or even the detailness of areas you normally would never visit really surprised me. The landscape it takes place is pretty  too and diverse enough. It has desserts, Mountains, Lakes and a big city hub.

The characters are also well written and their stories are  interesting enough to don't skip it (if they don't sit in the car) and completely different from each other. Nothing feels repetitive. Altought Trevor's starting missions are always the same: ""Blow up some Motor Bike Gangs and kill everybody"". Also his skill seems way overpowered.. But from the missions I played, the story feels great and especially Michael (who seems a bit like the Main character so far) feels like a great character and you can feel with him and his decisions he need to make. The only downside between different characters is that you always need to switch between them, specially during missions it's more annyoing like it would add anything to the game. But story writing is also way over the top.. Just like I imagined it:)

The Online Mode is like every PVE group focused Multiplayer game these days that has pvp aspects. If you have friends who also play that game, good for you. If not and need to depend on randoms.. Well you're mostly fucked as a new player. Also there is a big role play community. (Probably the reason why it's so famous on Twitch). If you like role playing in Video games and you had some wet stories in Goldshire back in the days, go for it. That must be heaven for you. I don't need role play so it's not my thing.. Also that you actually need to buy an Addon for starting in Multiplayer sucks.. Plus there are pay to win aspects in the form of shock cards.. That's straight a joke for a game which soled over 90 million and got over 6 billion dollar in revenue !!!! <.< And that Rockstar mostly doesn't care about modders and cheaters on an online game that features pay to win aspects is also rediculous... 

But the game is already worth it's price just for the Singleplayer, so go for it!:D Specially when it is on Sale. 
It's one of the few games on Steam that justifys it's full price and delivers great gameplay, amazing graphics and an amazing story..

I would say, Singleplayer 10/10
Multiplayer.. well something like 6/10 (still 6 points because of role playing aspects)
So if you like Singleplayer Open World Games or are a roleplay dude, it's a must have:)

10281,"completely reset your stats without any warning even when you have no used any mods, picked up modded cash or downloaded a cheat. Rockstar support will not revert your suspension/ban and refuse to look into your case when you ask them to over live support, only giving the same copy/pasted responses of ""all decisions are final and your ban/suspension will not be reverted."" They will refuse to check whether you are a legitimate player or not and if you are wrongfully banned, say goodbye to all the work you put into your character.

Meanwhile actual cheaters have a free reign in public lobbies, able to spawn in unlimited cash, unreleased vehicles, invincibility, the ability to kill anyone not in passive mode instantly. None of them get banned, while thousands of legitimate players do.

10297,The best game that has ever been made.,1
10298,"To text GTA 5, one has to analyze the singleplayer and multiplayer part seperately.

Let's start with singleplayer: GTA 5 offers more variety and things to do than any GTA game before. It features 3 main characters instead of one, lets you use all the weapons you can carry, and offers tons of cars, bikes, trucks, planes, helicopters, and other means of transportation. Furthermore, there's a huge city to explore, along with large rural areas, mountains, small villages, and a giant ocean. Experience a fun, crazy story about crime, family crisis, and general madness which you can repeat at any time at any point if you feel like it or if you want to unlock certain achievements. And if you get bored of causing mayhem all the time, you can relax at a game of golf, tennis, or choose some other, non-violent activities. Hang out with your virtual friends, take a dive in the ocean, do some parachuting, the choices seem virtually endless!
However, compared to previous titles in the series, there are also some aspects which have been downgraded a bit. For instance, some of the old minigames are now missing (bowling, pool). Also, they cut classic side missions like taxi driving, vigilante, fire fighter, and medic. Furthermore, the AI and general behavior of the NPCs has worsened as well: Instead of being a useful tool to get healed on the spot, medics have now become completely useless. Also, cops are now working much less efficient compared to GTA IV, which had impressive AI mechanics for the side of the law.
Nevertheless, the game is already worth buying for its singleplayer part alone, and if you get bored, there are a ton of gameplay mods to enrich your gaming experience. Don't go into online mode if you have them installed though, it won't end well!

Speaking of online mode, this is a completely different world. First: you need to put a lot of time and work into it (which basically means grinding for months) if you want to have all the fancy stuff (see my playtime? About 250 hours of that is singleplayer). You start as a little nobody inside a sea of people with flying bikes, tanks, pink fighter jets, and other things you've never seen before in singleplayer, who won't hesitate to blow you up as soon as the got you in their crosshairs. Also there's modders, but you can avoid trouble most of the time by changing session once they've been discovered. This might not sound very inviting at first, but once you've established a foothold and found other people to play with, you can have a lot of fun. The things you can do in multiplayer are so many more that i can't even count them all, but the two most important things (if you like to make money) are heists and criminal businesses. Grab four friends (or random players, but it's more likely to fail then) and plan robbing banks, drug dealers, or get involved in a plot where you have to save the entire world! If your team is good, so will be the payout. Once you got your first million, get out there and buy a drug lab, research bunker, weed farm, or whichever else your heart desires. Set them up, look after them, and you will have a constant flow of guaranteed income. Watch for griefers though! They love to ruin other people's experience and generally fuq things up for you. There are ways to avoid them however without having to cancel whatever you are currently doing. After gaining your first millions, use your money to buy super fast cars, missile shooting armored trucks with machineguns on top, a jetpack, there's something for everyone (as long as you have the money for it). And if you prefer certain gamemodes instead of a freeroam world, you can go racing, join in a deathmatch, play tennis, golf, or play some of the contact missions offered by different contractors. And if you just want to have fun, you can always goof around with other players.

In short:
Singleplayer: great
Online: Even greater IF you have a lot of time and people to play with.",1

10300,игра класс только читеров мнонога,1
10301,"PROS:
-driving,tuning and shooting are fun
-very good and unique character customisation
-the story is good
CONS:
-you need to go back and forth and do the same mission again and again to make some money to buy another type of mission that you are gonna do again and again to get another type of mission and so on,never getting any real profit atleast for the first 100 levels.This doesn't feel like a game,but more like your workplace where you have to do the same booring thing untill you pass out.
-some missions are very infuriating,especially because in some you need to travel the whole map which is more than 7 miles and you also need to return to that same spot
-VERY pay to win
-modders everywhere-they can lock you in cages or lock your computers in cages so the only option is to search another session
-the first loading screen take fucking ages,sometimes even failing or crashing
-matchmaking doesn't exist:you can be lvl 30 and be put in a server full of lvl 200s- i once was in a session with a lvl 8000 but i already said,modders.lots of them
-if someone wants to they can completly ruin your 300k money mission in just one rocket and that isnt because they get something out of it,they just do it because its ""fun"".Also,if you talk up to them,they will make your life hell if you dont switch the session and keep on killing you.
-its very bad that you can't search for a car to steal for the vehicle cargo mission directly from the warehouse-you have to go back to the CEO building which is 3 to 4 miles away and then you can select the mission.
----TOXIC COMMUNITY----
-your character moves like it has fucking iron in his fists and legs-very weird movement 
-the fucking population...sometimes,when you are casually driving to do your own shit a car suddenly turns and cuts your face or just crash into you,for no reason.
And so on.Can't recommend this game for any student or for someone that doesn't have 5 hours free a day to WORK in this game.",0

10309,"The story, graphics, and game mechanics are where this game shines. The world is so densely populated and there is so much to do with like-able, yet sometimes annoying, characters. The online mode is the worst part about the game, sadly, although it is a blast with friends, especially in the heist modes. The problems with the online mode is the unpredictable community--some days you will only find people avoiding you trying to grind for money, and other days you will face people who have played since day one of launch, who will kill you relentlessly until you leave. Also, if you do not have a four person squad, you will spend more time searching for people to play heists or online missions with longer than actually playing--bummer. Overall, though, the game is fun and definitely better than most games out nowadays.",1
10310,Online is nearly unplayable without hackers everywhere you go. That's one of the main reasons I play in solo lobbies. Mainly to avoid modders and griefers.

It is a good mix of the different characters in this game the three important ones are really different
to each other, optical and personality three characters how never become friends in real live,
But Rockstar Games made something incredible out of it. I really like it and the others like Lamar and Lester, Ron
you have many characters and the important ones have different friends and this makes it even more special
you will miss the characters in GTA 6 I hope the make really interesting characters in it !!

Map
It have so many things to show I know the map, the whole one but you can find so many Easter eggs its so funny 
and it makes more special and I think we have not find 100% of the Easter eggs its so big and I love it.
You have different areas in this Map one is the city its so big and through the Story the map become damaged.
The sea it is a whole new thing if you can see the things down ther it will impress you it is so beautiful and fascinated
and the destroyed ships other there water it is so great to look and have fun only with the Map

And here we are the modders , stupid shitty modders...they will lock you in the locker, explode you or they can kick you from the session . So funny right ? And rockstar game dont give a 𝐬𝐡𝐢𝐭 because only thing what they care of is money .

20.3.2021
Im a hardcore grinder in gta online. I robbed casino for like idk 200 times ? I robbed Mr.Rubio even more times.(solo).But the last heist (cayo) was the fcking nightmare. AI in this ""game"" is so ****** horrible. Sometimes the guard from the other side of the island can trigger a fckin alarm...that wouldnt be a problem with a other game from the other devs. But this game made a billions of dollars. This game was made in 2013 and ppl still playing this crab even this game is trash. Many of them are just cheaters like i said before.Nothing changed at all. Public sessions are worse than it was year ago. This game is unplayable for the new players. Paywalls,bad anticheat, devs dont care about thier community....And bugs and glitches ? lool if that glitch can make money in gta ? it will be fixed in few days but what about normal bugs and glitches ? Random disconnects in loading ? No why they would do that ? And what about freeze glitch after free spin ? Oh cmon, poor rockstar. They dont have time to give a fck about thier the most profitable game of all time. I still remember  MC business a bag sell mission what was deleted for unknown reason. Criminal mastermind ?(all classic heists without dying for 10 millions for every member) in 2021? LOOOL you must be joking. You cant do that anymore. Progress will be reset for unknown reason again. And rockstar ? They just dont give a shit. They care only about shark cards and selling copies. But i appreciate new radio stations after 4 years and ofc im also happy they fixed loading time after 7 years yea thanks Rockstar. Amazing work. This game used to be fun. But its not anymore. I know i have around 2K hours and + i have CD copy.xbox360 copy and the ps4 copy and another steam account and the epic account with gta with all of these i have around 3K hours and i still cannot recommend this game. This game become a money chasing shit. Shame on you rockstar

10.05.2021 i stopped playing this game on this account because rockstar cant make better anticheat. Cheater can join you through the R*ID with mod menu and troll you or crash your game.

There is a large grind, and more veteran players will easily destroy you, and there is little you can do about it as a low level, no matter how skilled you are. Then there are hackers, who are pretty much the same situation, but nobody can really defeat them if the hackers care enough. My advice is to try and find a session with only a few players, and whenever something gets sketchy in the slightest, switch sessions. This will avoid most hacking, since this prevents giving them time to mess with you. Overall a fun game, especially with friends, but be prepared for a grind and some disappointment or frustration. Especially since the AI seems programmed to get in your way by doing completely random and nearly unpredictable things constantly. At its now reduced price, it is more worth it than before, but still beware of what you are getting into.

Edit - Two years later, as a ""Veteran"" Higher Level player, all of the above still stands. The money grabbing tendencies of Rockstar can become very apparent, and frustrating. The issue with being attacked never stops. In a busy lobby, even at level 200, you can expect to be shot at, killed, or attacked for no apparent reason, either by other high levels, or lower levels hoping to get a quick kill and run while you are distracted. Experience/Level has no effect on how advanced hacks/modders can ruin the gameplay, as you might expect. I have found my ways to work around these issues generally, but it is still not all fun times, and it stays easy to become frustrated by either players or game mechanics. As I said before, the game can definitely be worth it to you, but beware of what you are getting into. I would give it a neutral text if I could.

Also - NEVER BUY A SHARK CARD. All you are doing is supporting the money-sucking business practices of Rockstar, and the benefit to you is almost nothing. In the many years since release, they have not adjusted the price to benefit ratio of a shark card. While in 2015, the $100, $8,000,000 In game card may have gotten you the best apartment, Multiple vehicles and customization, weaponry, and properties, not so anymore. The in game values have risen, so that 8 Million dollars will get you maybe 1 upgraded property, and two upgraded vehicles, or less. For example, the newest fast car they added costs 3.5 Million alone, without any upgrades. The newest property (submarine) costs 2.2 Mil for the basic model, and with all total upgrades, costs about 9 Million dollars. You could buy a $100 card, and STILL need more money for ONE fully upgraded new property.",1

10389,"GTA V is a very good game because there are many interesting things that can be done in this game either offline or online. Especially online games, many missions and various kinds of businesses that can be run. The disadvantage is that in almost every lobby there is a modder and some very annoying exploiters. Sometimes you need to change the lobby several times or make a solo lobby to play comfortably. So far GTA V is a very fun game to play because of the variety of activities that exist.",1

10393,"""Growing up — it's not about me, I steal cars and kill people,"" - in the hearts of one of the main characters of the game, a black bandit Franklin. In the game there is no answer to the remark, it flies after the leaving car, into the void.

Comes to mind the famous expression""we grow up, and the game — no"" Although in the first half of the year the industry has twice proved the opposite, in the case of GTA the same problem looks unsolvable, and Rockstar understand it. Still, the reason for the great success of this, according to the Guinness book of records, the most popular interactive entertainment on the planet — in the synthesis of its adult form and child essence.

""I need to meditate»
The fact that the authors highly reflective on this subject — seen through throughout the game. And-who would have thought - now social responsibility is among the values of Grand Theft Auto. Replica Franklin was in the game for the sake of"" protection from the fool"", which the authors offer to grow up: in the first minutes of GTA V ridicules its own audience, and the same Franklin venerable Bank robber (hands) Michael immediately advises not to chase a gangsta career and go to College. The sermon as a genre is served not only in a sarcastic manner, as in GTA IV, the sermon is adapted to the flock almost by Kevin Smith: on the pier there is a bearded long-haired Stoner Jesse, tells about the cool hipster beard of his father, advises everyone not to steam, not to smoke too much dope and thinks to turn the water into a latte.

And we-we do terrible, but fun things-Rob, kill, steal cars and generally live a gangster life. Now-alternately for the three characters; we can say, play a story between them. Anti-heroes are textured and self-sufficient, and the difference between them is grasped by one very important thing. Michael-a high-class gangster, the type of movies like ""Fight"" and ""Soprano Clan"" at the same time. With a duffel bag full of jewels on his shoulders, a suit, a mask and a rifle, in a street shootout, he feels more or less in his place. Franklin-a guy from the outskirts of Los Santos, in a gangster environment was born and raised, a typical Thriller ghetto wars, except that the gun does not hold horizontally. Imagine how this runs through the streets with a machine gun and mows dozens of people, you can hardly, but it is easier than a nameless criminal on errands or subtropical mafia in a Hawaiian shirt.

But Trevor Phillips, the mad redneck, who even the mad rednecks from the neighbor's trailer hell are afraid of, is easy. Trevor eats for Breakfast harsh bikers (quite possibly, literally) and one day captures all the illegal business in the area — from boredom, or something. He is smart, resourceful and disgustingly cruel.

Almost a player. Trevor-the first character, fully built into what is happening on the screen, the plot ceases to be an abstract condition for the action, and Vice versa. Trevor is a psychopath who could really go out and wreak havoc. Here the game is balanced, which is quite ironic. Namaste, Shavasana.

""Or masturbate»
To the player the game itself is unmerciful: GTA V immediately loudly, violently and categorically declares that it is hardcore and descent here will not give anyone. Stop whining, we have to go through a narrow arch, in the drift. A lot of cops, yeah, a lot. What about it? Challenge accepted. As a result, the game can be played many times (especially taking into account the system of medals for the mission), and the story clips are perceived as a separate type of reward.

After some particularly difficult forays in front of your eyes the camera rises somewhere in the stratosphere and in a few seconds transferred to another character. This is very impressive, and impress GTA V is able in principle: 256 million dollars looking at us from the screen every second, the game is enormous. Working out the details of the city and its boiling life look as if they were not engaged in the development team, and the entire population of the fictional state of San Andreas.

Each piece of information here-with a kitsch joke, all passers-by talk about something, urban and rural areas sound expressive, and the whole environment reacts vividly to the actions of the player. There are a lot of small cultural joys scattered around the world, such as kinotsitat or soundtrack, and the dialogues are clearly written by the masters of the case. At the same time aesthetically GTA V-is still a game-fanservice: acidified Michael goes home by bike (of course), in his intonations sometimes caught the same Tony Soprano (especially in the scenes in the kitchen), then — a direct quote from the ""Robbery in Italian"". All the way.

Here you can listen to the radio anthem on the radio, instagram, while you instagram, and chase the unfortunate Mariachi in the company of the ziguyuschego patriot Joseph (speaks pure Russian). A step back, in San Andreas, even looks logical in the sense that this is the ""balancing"" part of the series, she does yoga, pulling the mechanics to aesthetics. While the mechanics has become less realistic, thereby further emphasizing the frivolity of what is happening, the form-on the contrary. Quite often, the game can put a condition ""what if I do this?""and get a realistic ending. Physics of bodies makes any accident, a fight or a simple fall spectacular, and YouTube is already full of curiosities (however, as well as glitch from GTA Online.

The main novelty, of course, - robberies. As expected, in fact they — well forgotten old: one of the best moments of GTA: Vice City developed and spun into a separate game. We have docking mission preparation for the ""case"" — planned robbery, and produced the necessary equipment. Then we pass one difficult mission with a robbery and the account is replenished with the amount of five (and sometimes six) zeros. In this regard, each character has special abilities: Franklin drives in the bullet-time, Michael shoots in the bullet-time, and Trevor falls into a rage: gets less damage, inflicts more. Additional drivers, shooters and hackers can be hired in a special menu — there we choose the way and the way of attack, and forward. Victory or death.

""Or all at once»
I stand on the road somewhere in the desert, asphalt-pink in the sunset, on my glasses-aviators in his hand-a gun with a silencer. Life is complicated. There was a car in the distance, and I know what's going to happen in this movie, because the decision has already been made. Then it's just a crime scene and a quiet country radio in a car bombarded. For a minute and a half of real time in GTA V has time to happen so much interesting that the whole cutscene of the game would be enough cheaper. Got into a fight with the homeless, doused them with gasoline and set fire, tried to steal a jeep, a dead driver knocked down, his leg was stuck in the radiator, the cops killed, got into the jeep, went, the gas tank is broken, burn, jump on the asphalt, the car explodes in the distance. It's all in two minutes.

Now die in an accident-easier than ever (much easier than in GTA IV), and the city all the time you go with this idea. Smeared on the fly on the oncoming traffic-the path will continue in the air, without a car. But the car is almost always possible to flip the left stick — unrealistic, Yes, but not break the rhythm of the game. And it eventually became more harmonious, not without flaws, but for such large object as GTA, — serious achievement. The feeling of continuous action is one of the main goals of Rockstar in the case of GTA V. Story quests follow without interruption, clinging to each other, which is why the player from the first seconds captured the story and may well go through the game, a couple of times looking at the menu with incredible beauty ambient Tangerine Dream. The game is included, and it goes forward as a film about gangsters, but without our participation the film does not spin.

10439,"[h1] Pros [/h1]
[u] Online [/u]
This [b] online portion [/b] of this game is more addictive than Meth. The game is large, so you'll need a good pc to run it. If it's good enough to crank everything to the max setting, the graphics make you forget what reality is. So much time and effort has been put into this game.

[u] Single player campaign [/u]
The story mode is the most amazing thing I have ever played in my entire life. If you play it consistently, not just on and off, you become emotionally attached to the characters and sometimes have difficulty doing events relating [i] against [/i] them.

Speaking of characters, the story mode has 3 main characters. Each are introduced later in the story, with their own lifestyle. All 3 characters have their own missions and ""Strangers and Freaks."" (funny little side missions unique to each character.) [b] Each character's missions intertwine into one another to make for an awesome central storyline. [/b]

[h1] Cons [/h1]

[u] Hackers/modders [/u]
Yes...there are too many modders. I feel that Rockstar needs to implement some form of anti chest like ""Easy anti cheat"" or ""Battle Eye."" They don't seem to take any action and its too easy to get access to exploits.

[b] FOLLOWING UP ON THAT: [/b] The modders don't really ruin any of the gameplay. Most of them just give you money. [I] However to be honest, there aren't really a lot of active modders anymore. They've mostly moved on. [/I]

[U] Resource Demanding [/u]
Gta is a very resource Demanding game, meaning you'll need a good pc to run it. The [I] minimum I'd recommend is an i5 and gtx 1050ti. [/I]

[H1] Final thoughts [/h1]

Unlike most super awesome games...gta is now only $30. This is 100% totally worth your money and you'll get hooked on it. I'd suggest playing online too. Thats where most of the action is.

9.2/10 | Extremely fun",1

10442,"Preordered this for xbox 360, beat it a couple times, great game.

One year late:
Bought for xbox 1, Went from fun even gameplay to a couple weapons/vehicles that you pretty much had to pay for (with real money)to get. W/e 90% of gameplay is still even/fair.

Bought 4 Months ago for Computer:
Everything is 2M+, missions pay 15K each. Special missions take about an hour each, and after completeing 6 of them, you get 1M.  Players that buy shark cards/ hack have taken over the game.  Random deaths from hackers cost money.  People with 4M jets trolling while making any sort of session mission (delivery, pickup, ect).   Spawns are literally in the middle of nowhere. While doing missions anywhere on the West side of map, only two spawns are available. Middle of the mountain, or on the pier.  No vehicles spawn nearby while doing hostile takeover, so once you get shot by sharpshooters (cops holding to the side of a fast moving suv shooting full auto, with one hand, at your fast moving vehicle while you're ducking down, and still hitting 25/30 shots from just inside your render distance(i'm using an 1060)) there is no way to get back to brief case. So you spend the next 20 minutes with a 4* wanted level literally running (because no cars spawn) from the cops... Remeber those $4M jets i mentioned earlier.. those shoot exploding rounds(3 foot radius instakill) at a rate of 100/second. Now you're getting blown up by enemy players and shot up by cops.  Cops pay no attention to the jet. They are solely focused on you.  Homing missiles don't work on jets unless you were to hit them directly. If you die, you lose about $1,500 (medical expenses) and one clip/rocket/throwable from you current weapon (rockets are $700ea). 
50cal sniper isnt unlocked until level 90, mini-gun isnt unlocked until level 100(or 120). 

Pros: 
Pretty good graphics.
Cool assortment of cars (online only)
50% off sales that are helpful for beginners (mostly on properties an Shark Cards(cards you buy with real money in exchange for fake money)).
Virtual Topless Strippers?

Cons:
Story mode vehicles have had 1(one) update since I picked up the game for xbox 360.
Buying anything that wasn't part of the original release takes at least 1 Million dollars.
Hacking is rampant.
Missions provide less money than they used to.
Pathfinding for your character has gone down (char runs to every car but the mission vehicle 25% of the time.)
AI aim is impossibly accurate when doing money making missions.(and it gets worse the more money you have in your bank)
Durring money making missions, Pedestrian cars cross 5 lanes of traffic to hit you head on if you're driving too fast. (as well as turn into you/ cut you off.)
Enemy AI can hit you from 250yds+ away, 30/30 with an uzi from a moving car that is driving down a mountain.
Cars that are 3k in real life are 950k in game.
Installing a wide body kit and a roll cage in a car costs over 1million.
Flying cars with heat seaking missiles.(about 2.2M)
Flying motorcycles with heat seaking missiles.(1.9M)
Bunker upgrade (costs a couple million) allows players to sit inside their bunker and shoot anywhere on the map with a satalite ray gun that insta-kills anything it hits.
The more missions you play, the less money you make per mission.(play 10 missions in a day, go from 20k down to 9k per mission... meaning flying car requires about 244 twenty minute missions to buy, which is 82 real life hours of doing the same 30 missions have to be spent to buy one car.)

Biggest complaint? 
Either the fact that this fun game you could play casually has turned from a ""pay-to-play"" to a ""pay-to-play, pay-16x More-to win""

or the programming desinged to crap on players:
AI cars will supernaturally speed up, run red lights, and then almost come to a complete stop in the middle of an intersection (if its a 6 lane intersection, they stop in your lane) as you attempt to deliver a vehilce. (More damage the vehicle takes, the more money come out of pocket when you get them to your wearhouse) Enemy AI will shoot at their boss's ""priceless"" car from 500 yards away(blow it up if need be) and will hit the car every time(but miss you). Traffic density becomes insane on these missions.

When delivering anything else, enemy AI becomes impossibly accurate(see previous explanation with mountain), Pedestrians will drive into you from 5 lanes over. 

Cars don't spawn during excape missions/ Bring Your Own Car missions.  Cops don't care about people who didn't start a mission. Guy in jet lands, runs, grabs case, runs off. 2/10 cops shoot at him with 5 stars, but will not chase him.  Meanwhile, you're trying to run away (because no cars spawn in a 5 block radius from where you spawn) and you get mowed down by every cop once the jet guy leaves the area.

Matchmaking is terrible. People with high-mental state (players who kill and destroy senslessly) get put in the same lobbies as me(i've ""senslesly"" killed 4 players since the games release). 



If you're looking for a game casual game to get money and drive nice cars, look elsewhere.

10452,"I guess rockstar doesn't really care what's happening with the multiplayer anymore... The SP remains good as it was made by competent Rockstar. But the MP got fucked up beyond repair. It all happened somewhere around 2017 when they started adding crazy vehicles that didn't belong in GTA at all. Now you're at the point where you're trying to collect cargo from a misson where normally no other player should be involved, but you're being chased by multiple flying motorcycles which can shoot large amounts of homing missles at your unbelievably vurnurable and slow moving car. I don't know how it happened, but somehow everyone has the flying missle shooting bike now. You're at the point where you're just looking for an online server with only 5 or less people. Way to go, multiplayer. Rockstar tries to keep a large playerbase by giving you free money on certain moments, but the reason everyone leaves this game is because of the dull missions and the crazy overpowered vehicles that kill you over and over and over AND OVER again. The multiplayer has become an unbelievable game of pay to win (or cheat to win) and it's annoying as fuck. If that isn't enough, there are hackers in every server. If you're not getting griefed by O.P. vehicles, you will spontaneously catch fire or explode by hackers. It's like Rockstar doesn't even care about this. No actions are being taken to reduce hackers. It's really bad. 
The multiplayer will leave you frustrated, tired and probably pretty angry too. Maybe even so angry that you start writing a nagative text. 

Fuck off Rockstar. You fucked up one of the best games out there and instead of learning from your mistakes, you make things even worse. It's insulting to the entire gaming community.


update:
I don't know where all the positive texts are coming from. The multiplayer is still the biggest shitshow on the planet. You join a server and get instakilled by a kid on a flying motorcycle, so you switch sessions and the next thing you know, after 1 minute, you get randomly kicked from the next session.

All I get are emails saying to log into social club and check status. Hey dumb  banana suckers. I can't log in. Maybe read what my issue is before copy and pasting some nonsense reply. 
 
 Not sure why they suck so bad now. My advice is avoid RockStar games. They are more then happy to take your money. 

Don't count on them helping if you have an issue.",0

10458,"~text FOR THE ONLINE VERSION~

What the actual fuck happened with this game. After a one year break I tried playing some online with my friends. We spent over one hour trying just to join THE SAME LOBBY WITHOUT ONE OF US DISCONNECTING. And this was not our fault, the game kept disconnecting us until we gave up and came here writing this text. Eat my ass rosckstar games.",0
10459,"So i have seen a lot of texts in which people say that you will get killed by modders and get your game crashed or ruined by them . There is going to be a part of this text where i tell you how to get a non toxic friendly experience in this game .

I have played the game for 3 years now and i haven't played a game in which i can spend basically an infinite amount of playtime  . I love the game the fact that you can do whatever you want be whoever you want etc etc. 

Ok now this is the part where i talk about how to actually have fun in GTA ONLINE .
1. Join a friendly grinder crew : you can find some by simply asking on reddit or just googling gta online friendly crews . This has worked the best for me and that's what is keeping me still playing the game otherwise i would've stopped a long time ago . 
2. If you really want to enjoy the game DO NOT get hundreds of millions from modders because that way you basically ruin your whole experience .
3. If you want to make money watch the professional of youtube he has perfect guides on how to make money in the game . 
4 . Honestly i can't think of anything else because joining a friendly crew is one of the best things you could do in GTA ONLINE they have dedicated sessions in which only people from the crew play so there isn't a threat from modders or griefers or toxic players in general . The game is extremely good entertaining and fun you just need to know how to find the right people to play with and when you do that ( join a friendly crew and play in the crew's sessions ) you will never ever again need to play in the chaotic full of modders and griefers and toxic players or tryhards sessions again which are the default GTA ONLINE sessions when you click ONLINE on the main menu . 

So i hope someone reads this text before he buys the game and can almost immediately join a friendly crew and start enjoying this amazing game .",1

10468,"Whatever millions were spent on this game wasn't worth the experience, but I read their investors are happy! ♥

The GTA series has been rough for a while, and this one's actually a good kick in the right direction. The world is vibrant, animations and car mechanics are fluid, and the 3-character dynamic was a nice breath of air. The story is meh; I'm still crawling through it and I only like one of the 3 characters--but the stories aren't why I play GTA. The cloud-save feature is nice! I love that I don't have to manage my savefiles offline! I wish the cops' AI was more similar to IV, but I like the new AI too--they just seem less intelligent. The the new cop-ditching system is fun--ducking in cars or hiding in bushes is cool. Ignoring story, I like this GTA a lot as a sandbox for havoc.

The multiplayer is wretched. I don't think I've had a single good experience online, and I'm afraid that's where most of Rockstar's focus is. I don't want to lobby with other players, and missions are multi-player only. So why play online? There is game-content I'd like to access (flying motorbike, extra missions for example) that is locked away in a dysfunctional network.

Network aside, I'm constantly being hounded to buy $multi-million ventures over the phone, every few minutes--ventures I can't afford... every few minutes. Missions reward you with about $10-15k on success, take 5-10 minutes to complete, and are surrounded by at least 5 minutes of loading on each end of the event--excluding any several-minute cutscenes a player hasn't seen yet. So in total, I'm making about $1k per minute, *at best*. I'm sure there are more lucrative ways to make cash, but at this rate I'm just staring at a mountain of work I don't want to deal with because the whole experience is a slow-paced aggravation. With the ""success"" of GTA Online, I'm willing to bet people just buy cash cards instead of earning the money--in other words, you can just buy game items with real-world money to skip.. ""the game"". What is this world?

Here's an example of my frustration: I had to re-play the same mission (the *first* multi-player mission, with Lamar) I don't know how many times--with the relobbying and all the loading between.. guh--if you really want to include all of that: It probably took 3 hours to complete this one, simple mission. It was just a few drive-bys, but with four players, one would die and leave the lobby, forcing a reset. What a terrible experience.",0
10469,I had to go back to GTA V on ps4 because of all the hackers. I have always played legit and the fear of getting banned from ppl that hack and mod is just nuts. I have to make clear i have not been banned but reading people that have for no reason makes me just play it safe and play on ps4.,0

10474,Grad Theft Auto 5 is a good game no its a amazing game worth 60$ alone for the singleplayer itself. However Online is a bit of a mess if you join so late but its a very good addition that you can sink 100's of hours into alone. I high recommend Grand Theft Auto 5,1
10475,"My second favourite of the GTA titles. The plot is average, but you witness Franklin, Michael and Trevor's character developments and how they grow throughout the story. Sure, they may be criminals, but it's nice to see their perspective in a game for a change. 

As for the online mode, it's really a mixed bag. When you're a new player and you start getting into it, going through all the races the first time, completing hard heists with others after struggling and failing multiple times, it's really captivating. However, after a while, to be honest, it gets boring. After you've done it all, stole all the jets from the military base, done all the VIP missions, got revenge against all the tryhards after your newly purchased Buzzard, there's really nothing else to do except replay missions and do the same things. Sure, Rockstar still keeps releasing updates and adding new content, but overall, after each update, it still feels the same. 

You will enjoy this game a lot when you're playing it for the first time, and even after that for months. But after some time, that joy will slowly and noticeably fade.",1

10487,"TL;DR: If you only now think of buying this game, don't do it because PvP with leveling in an open world destroys the whole experience.

If you don't already have a considerably higher-level account from you consoles to take with you to PC: good luck trying to make any progress in the open world. The beauty of an open-world PvP game with leveling, whose player base consists to a noticable amount of toxic try-hards, is that you are very likely to be killed by someone who wants to ruin your fun in a way that you can't compete with unless you reached the needed level for weapon countering said ways. Try to use your beginner-weapons to counter being carpet-bombed by an airplane that can take several rocket hits, a fighter jet, flying cars, bikes, or jetpacks with rockets and miniguns, tanks, or people with full armor and weapon that shoot incendiary bullets. 

If you could avoid all those people and their overpowered gear and only play with friends on a private server, that'd be nice, but some functions are only accessible when one is playing in open lobbies for no other reason than to make the game more frustrating and indirectly persuade one to buy Shark Cards.

The new update MIGHT make things a bit more bearable as for the first couple of days a lot more people who aren't taking the game as serious as a national emergency are attracted to playing it again, but after about 2 to 4 weeks, that update only meant that the level 400 players have new gear to completely obliterate anyone who hasn't yet reached the level to feasibly fight back.",0
10488,"I paid for this a while back and planned on playing it. it seemed fun and I liked a lot of the older GTA games. but I cant even launch the game due to the social club not accepting the information I used to set up the account. I do IT for a living and could spend an hour or two figuring out what went wrong, contacting tech support and tons of other stuff. but im not going to do that becuse I got this to game and relax not to work more.

- online is also fun

Bad things about the game:
- rockstar ban issues
- game can become annoying 

Recommendation: 
I recommend to try this game out because its a open world game that you can do anything you want and kill anyone you want.

10515,"First things first, lets get the ""mixed texts"" part out of the way. Now you might wonder what made this game that had ""very or overwhelmingly positive texts"" on steam suddenly take a hit. Well this was because of the publisher of the game, tried to curb modders/ modding. And the modding scene in gta is one of the biggest, and people didnt take this very well and rightfully so, hence a lot of folks decided to change their texts from positive to negative. So this stupid facade was recalled and everyones happy again.

Onto the game, this is truly one of my favorite masterpieces in terms of singleplayer. If youre solely getting this for SP, you wil not be disappointed. Great characters, great story, a fair amount  of choices for a Gta game, amazing visuals and graphics, good physics , highly detailed environments, so much stuff to do, the missions are well laid out, and driving around Los Santos is just breathtaking, and the list goes on and on all combined with the classic GTA formula.
The singleplayer was well worth the complete price if not more so look no further if you want to get this game for the offline story. 
The modding scene will get you hours of fun when you just want to fool around as the hulk or if you want to make the game look like a supposed Gta 6

Now multiplayer is GTA is kind of a mixed bag, its not bad but surely could be done better. You will not run out of things to do very soon since R* constantly pushes out content updates for the game. But unfortunately with each update, the prices of the items from that update are highly inflated, now this would be fine if the jobs would pay out more as well but they dont, they give you almost the same amount of money. Hence the grind to get any of the new stuff is infuriating. Then, there are the occasional K/D warriors who kill you and then go into passive mode so that you wont be able to kill them , and random twats in hydras waiting to bomb the shit out of you when youre delivering goods. I know its part of the game to be a dick but these constantly love killing that same person/ new player over and over, and thus create a bad experience for him.

All in all, great game, highly recommended!",1
10516,"This is the best GTA game yet in many ways. If you loved earlier GTA games chances are you will enjoy this one. Personally, I've always felt like past GTA games have had poor gameplay and writing. GTA V has mediocre gunplay and decent writing so that's a step up, but it still suffers from the same problem that makes all GTA games dead boring to me: most of the time is spent driving from point A to point B. That's the reason I almost didn't finish Watch Dogs 2 and that's the reason I'll never finish GTA V. 

GTA Online can be fun with friends but more than 75% of the time is spent in menus and loading screens. If you're playing alone it's going to be painful rather than fun.

Steam needs a 'meh' option for texts. This isn't a bad game but it definitely isn't a good game either. If this had come out 5 years earlier it would have been much appreciated, but as it stands there are too many high quality games out there to spend time on this lackluster product.",0

What I enjoyed was a game where I could relax and just have fun driving around the city in online mode, collect cars and running from the cops. The addition of maybe running into another player was always fun. Like I said, I did very little online content but still managed to rack up 78 hours just messing around. I have never used any sort of exploite in any rockstar games ever. A monkey that morphed into an alian and called me father once gave me some money, but that was years ago.

 I log in one day to find I have a month ban. No explaination. After the ban lifted the servers were down for several more weeks. Finally after everything was back to normal I log in to find my character has been wiped. I opened a ticket to Rockstar and said the following.

""Ok, so I have never once used a single exploit or hack in ANY rockstae game. If you text my player profile at all you will see I barely ever did anything but collect cars, drive around and find other players to either talk with or kill. I have yet to do pretty much anything in online mode and have still racked up 78 hours of play time. Then, over a month ago, I try to log in to find I have a month ban with no explanation. Finally the ban lifts and I try to log in, only to find the servers down for weeks. After they are up again, I log in to find my character gone and any progress I had made wiped. How, how in the world do I get band for driving around pretty much just enjoying the city, when there are people regularly flying around with god mode on dropping planes on people or just exploding them where they stand? Is it possible to have my character restored? I just want to keep practicing drifting in my frikin toyota.""

Not more than a SECOND goes by and I receive this.

10533,"Apparently losing connection in GTA online results in a month ban and character reset. Lost connection playing Trapdoor with friends and when I came back online, I got banned.

This error is entirely on Rockstar's side and I can't even defend myself from their screwup.

I played for three days and then encountered an infinite loading screen on the fourth after I had completed a job. I waited for 15 minutes. It was still stuck loading in the map view. I went away for a few hours and did other things. I came back and it was still loading.

I forcefully exited the game and shutdown my PC. I tried to login the next day and it said I was banned.

10536,"Been playing Rockstar games for as long as I can remember, thuroughly enjoyed GTA:V I would gladly give this game a good text if it wasnt for their treatment of players and the general broken economy.

If you so much as want to buy a cheap datsun 240z in game you'll have to log over 300 hours in game to farm over 1,000,000 in cash to buy a car that is about 2,000 dollars in real life.

Further more, tired of farming heists with random ppl and never being able to finish them in their entirety i spent some money on shark cards because i wanted to drive my dream cars. Fast forward a few months my account is banned.

Why? I couldn't tell you, calling and speaking to rockstar customer service i am greeted with, 
""All bans are final and will not be appealed"" when asked why i was banned the response is, ""we reserve the right to deny all online services without notice or liability""

I will never purchase another Rockstar game or give them any of my time. Their treatment of players and customers is absurd, i was robbed of over $200.00 of real american dollars because rockstar feels i was a hacker without proof or cause.

Fuck you rockstar, fuck your customer service, fuck your $6,000,000,000.00 in sales the least you can do is listen to a customer when they ask for proof of violating the terms of service.",0

10551,"This text is mainly aimed towards the online part of the game. If you're only interested in the singleplayer aspect, then I can absolutely recommend the game. The singleplayer is great. The only big negative I can say about it is the lack of new content, as the online part is receiving lots of new content that for some odd reason isn't being added in the singleplayer.

Alright, so over to GTA Online. I could honestly write several pages with detailed analyses about why I don't recommend the online part, but I'll save us both some time and try to keep it short instead. All of my hours in game is spent on the online part of the game (I played the singleplayer on PS). I used to love GTA Online. My friends and I have had hours of fun and I also met many great people there. 

Then suddenly R* started changing their business practice. They began introducing big updates where the main focus was to get the players to invest their in game money in “businesses”, and then basically grind with said businesses to make more in game money. They also raised the in game prices for the new content compared to the original content, so in order to enjoy the new content you’d have to spend hours grinding, or, as is the foundation of this model, get you to spend real money on so-called “Shark Cards” to get enough in game money for the new content. This has only gotten worse and worse with every new update they introduce to the game. Basically, what has happened is that they’ve made the online part similar to a “pay-to-win” game, where you either have to pay with real money, or with hours upon hours of your time with grinding, to actually be able to enjoy the new content. This has also made a huge gap between the “haves” and “have nots” in the game.

I’ll put this ridiculous business model in perspective for you. There’s a plane in the game that costs 6,5 million in gta dollars. To be able to afford this plane without any grinding (it would take you several hour-long play sessions) you’d need a “Megalodon Card”, worth 8 million GTA$. The Megalodon Card costs 699 NOK on Steam, or roughly 90 USD. With some quick calculations (#QuickMaffs) we’ll see that the price of this one plane. This one. single. plane. is the equivalent of 73 USD. That’s insane… 

Also, with every new update they introduce a new arsenal of weapons and weaponized vehicles. These are ridiculously expensive and often equally over powered. We now have flying cars with lock-on missiles that basically can’t be avoided. Like I said, this increases the gap between the ""haves"" and the ""have nots"". It's not about skill anymore - it's about being able to afford the new and overpowered equipment. 

The free roam lobbies are filled with trolls and griefers. It’s often total chaos. Oh, did I mention that this chaos is where you have to do your grinding in order to make in game money? It is, and you’re likely to get killed while making a delivery, thus losing your money and your time grinding will have been for naught. 

Among the griefers and trolls there are also a fair share of hackers in this game. If you go one hour in the game without encountering a hacker, I’d consider you lucky. I wonder if R* see the correlation between the increase in hackers and the increase in in game prices. No wonder people are hacking to be able to enjoy the new content without having to grind or pay real money. Wherever there’s a hacker there are usually a horde of kids begging for money drops as well. It’s like half of the players consider themselves lucky to come across a hacker, making it really difficult to actually solve the hacking problem in the game. 

Lastly there are the loading times. The loading times in this game, especially in GTA Online, are ridiculous. Entering a lobby, waiting for lobbies to populate, accepting an invite from a friend. It takes forever. Often you’ll also experience getting kicked out in limbo because you tried to join a different lobby, that turned out to be full, and the game already booted you out of the previous lobby you were in, so now you’re “lobby-less” and have to stare at a loading screen for five minutes. Thanks for that.

This game is ruined for me. It feels like such a chore trying to get enough money to buy something new. The whole shark card deal has ruined a game that used to be amazing. RIP. I'll miss the good old days.

10561,"UPDATE - 18/07/2021

I had been considering changing this text to Recommended because I still play GTA Online everyday on the PlayStation and love the experience. However, it has come to my attention that Rockstar Games has once again been shutting down mods for both GTA V and for older GTA games. I cannot in good conscience recommend the game when there is no respect for the hard work made by modders, so I will be keeping this text as Not Recommended.


ORIGINAL:

I’ve played the Grand Theft Auto series for almost 20 years now. I own every Grand Theft Auto game released, even London 1969 and 1961. I own many of the games on multiple platforms and both in physical and digital form. I've completed most of the series to 100% and achieved the Platinum trophies on GTA 3, VC, SA and GTA V on PS4. You could say I'm something of a fan of GTA. Any of the other GTA games I would recommend in a heartbeat, hell even GTA V itself for the single player and modding opportunities I would too, but the shocking handling and mistreatment of the PC version of GTA Online (GTA Online as a whole has been mishandled but the PC version is the worst by far) has made this an easy text to make. Do not buy this game unless you are intending only to play single player, mod the game, or play a mod that adds multiplayer functionality to single player such as FiveM. Basically, only buy this game if you are planning on doing anything that does not connect to GTA Online at all or you’ll surely fall victim to a ban eventually. I play GTA Online on the PS4, so I don’t have to deal with modders and huge ban waves such as this, but it disgusts me that Rockstar time and time again screws over legit players on the PC version of the game. They fail to implement any proper form of anti-cheat, and the times they do implement one it tends to target those who don't cheat at all. This is the case with this latest banning spree, and thanks to the poorly thought out suspension policies Rockstar has implemented, many people will now either lose their character progress and must restart with a new character after 30 days, or completely be banned from GTA Online if it’s their second suspension. For one, that is a dreadful policy to have when the anti-cheat systems are as god awful as they are, and two, when something does mess up Rockstar won’t even acknowledge it and instead leaves everyone in the dark. On top of that, their support won’t even touch the subject and if ‘ban’ is mentioned in the ticket it automatically closes after a few days. Its just shocking how poorly they treat their customers. I’ve always liked Rockstar’s secretive approach to their game releases and updates, knowing they’re cooking something up behind the scenes, but its 2018 and they need to finally catch up with the times by hiring a community manager and attempt to become more public facing like other developers have done. They can keep their secretive approach to releasing games, but they need to actively communicate and participate with the players especially in times like this where a large portion of the player-base is being banned for no good reason. 

It is truly sad. I used to talk proudly of Rockstar as being a shining example of a developer that makes amazing games with no shortcuts and corners cut and looked at their publisher Take Two as a gentle and benevolent overseer who stayed out of way and let them get on with it. Now it sickens me when I hear of their incessant meddling and desire to shut down anything that might cost them a few Shark Card sales. My suggestion to Take Two is to get lost. You’ve ruined the GTA brand enough and if you aren’t careful you’ll end up running it into the ground. Unfortunately, they won’t hear what I have to say, but they might hear and listen to a whole bunch of people complaining about their awful approach to managing this game, especially if it starts to affect their bottom line. Hopefully its sooner rather than later.",0
10562,Got banned for no apparent reason. Rockstar refuses to offer any support.,0
10563,"I play this game as Co-Operative with other players, never bother with the PVP aspect, I have reached level 1300+ by focusing most of my efforts on gaining RP(Experience Points) most of my game play involves driving planes boats and trucks to checkpoints, and collecting boxes with nonsensical names on them which i really pay no attention to. I have also focused on money making which mostly involves spending money on X for income produced over time, which i can sell with other player (drive vehicles to checkpoints),I also help people sell these X income over time with silly names. i have maxed out my garage spaces with motor vehicles and air planes jets and helicopters. I do not like to think of myself as a culprit or criminal in this game, more like a vigilante or undercover cop. i do not enjoy blowing up other players and never participate in it, our group consists of many players that only play legitimately (all 18+), without the use of hacks bugs or exploits or any game play that breaks the game rules set by rock star.(the game End User License Agreement), i have gotten all my in game money and experience points and levels this way. and i have almost 10k hours of playtime with as many screenshots to show you that i do not cheat at all, i have not been banned for any illegal activity ether, i play 100% legitimately. I play for the enjoyment of driving fast cars, motorbikes, aircraft, jets and helicopter. and i also enjoy the aesthetic value of the game, the graphics are beautiful, you can check my screenshots, i keep bloodshed to a minimal, there is some of it in this game, it is not nearly as bad as you might think. and i pay almost no attention and have no interest in it. this game is purely fiction to me, and have no interest in duplicating anything within the game as set by the game EULA. if you enjoy fast cars, planes jets, helicopters, motorbikes and all sorts of vehicle, with beautiful scenes and excellent physics you will most probably enjoy this game.",1
10564,"*EDIT*

As of the time of this edit, I have just received a confirmation email from R* stating that my account ban has been lifted and my profile and account will be fully reinstated over the next few hours. I have to be honest and say I was not expecting this considering the roads that we as a community have traveled down before when it comes to R* and their ever present fiascos from time to time. And to be truthful... I'm kind of touched by this... its the first thing in a long while that shows R* does pay some kind of attention to the community even if we'll never get our perfect vision of the product in the end. Don't hold this minor setback against R* forever but just remember that perhaps there is still some good left in the video game industry even after all the issues we've been dealing with these past couple of years; and hopefully this'll be the turn around we've been waiting for from R*. 

As more innocent bans get lifted I will switch this over to a positive recommendation but for the time being its just nice to see that I will actually return to GTA V rather than setting it aside for what would probably be a lifetime. Hope everyone else who got wrongfully banned is getting their issues settled as well.",0

What ruins everything is the ""Social Club"" which is responsible for your online account. I've played the game since it came out on the PS3 and I've spent many hundred hours playing online. When it was published for PC I bought only for the reason that I can transfer my online account and continue playing with it online. It worked well and I couldn't complain. However, when I wanted to play again after a while Social Club somehow did not manage to let me log into my account. Apparently it was deleted for no reason without even messaging me. On PS3 and PS4 my account still exists and I can play perfectly fine. Nevertheless, it is impossible to access my account on PC. There's no way I could ever reestablish what I achieved. Therefore, I'd never play - or can't play - GTA V on PC. Thanks for that Social Club.",0

10572,"This game is astonishingly annoying. How about make a game where you can actually play and have fun rather than sitting there and doing the same damn thing over and over again for HOURS just to make enough money to buy a car you could get easily off the side of the street. And this car you now have that you wasted your money on just sits there in the same spot no matter what until you spend ANOTHER 7 HOURS doing the same mission over and over again to buy a garage that holds 2 cars (if you're even lucky enough to afford two). Theres heists that can make you lots of money, but those also take time and the NPC's you fight in them have perfect aim which makes it really difficult to complete them. Don't get me wrong, this game has great content and im glad that rockstar adds new content still. But the fact that a reliable car costs you hours worth of grinding is ridiculous and it's getting on my nerves. If you want to be able to afford anything in online mode, look for a modder, because it'll take you weeks to afford some of the essential items in this game.

The Online community in this game is THE WORST i have ever experienced in my entire life. Good luck finding a lobby that doesn't have some toxic ass 12 year old who gets amusmant out of pissing off everyone in the lobby and then says ""XD kid ur so bad LOL"". I have never played a game with a more toxic community and it really ruins the game. I've spend the majority of my time in that game looking for a lobby that i can actually play in without being shot down by a tryhard in a hydra every 30 seconds.

Story mode has some issues too. The story is just you running around killing people while listening to lester or whoever it is tell you where to go if you're too lazy to look down at the minimap in the corner. Modding singleplayer is tricky and you risk breaking the game quite a bit. It's not simple like a lot of other games, and it requires a lot of digging into the files. It would be much easier if rockstar just made their own modding API.

This game is alright if you can afford things and have fun with them in online mode, and if you know how to mod singleplayer. If you can't do either of those, then don't waste your money.",0

10585,"Please read the following: (carefully):
The gameplay and the DLC content is freakin amazing. Rockstar Customer Service Agents are amazing, but the mechanics of the game is total crap. Their ban system is automatic, that basically means the AI will automatically ban you, instead of having a User/Person behind the computer monitoring the ban system. Lazy. And there is no way to appeal your ban. All bans are made as final decision and the final decision are all made by the AI System.

My experience with GTA V:
I have never cheated or modded ever. I actually do play mission to get in-game cash. Then this happened, I couldn't play a mission due to a bug/glitch. I decided to inform Rockstar Customer Service about this glitch through their Live Chat System. I followed the instructions give by the Rockstar Customer Support Agent (Verify game cache & Restart PC). After the restart, I logged back into the Online Servers to see if whether or not it was fixed. As soon as I loaded into the GTA Online, I got permabanned. For what reason? I went straight back to their customer service asking what happened. Their Customer Service Agent is super professional and friendly, we were just chatting back and forth waiting for the results of my ban. Even the UNDISCLOSED AGENT said how their ban system works and agrees how it is unfair to most players, who are casual to normal players. For the UNDISCLOSED AGENT's honest opinion, He deserves a promotion. But in the end, my permanent ban is not unlifted. The UNDISCLOSED AGENT tried every method he could do, but was unsuccessful.

Would I recommend this game?
Hell Yah. If you want to risk losing your money that was used to  purchase this. I have to say though, the GTA V gameplay is good, some people may say its worth getting.
But from my perspective?: (look down below)

From my experience?
I would definitely not recommend you to play this game due to lack of effort done in their banning system. If you get banned, I would recommend you not to repurchase the game again, they basically scam you. They banned people (who does NOT CHEAT) and force you to repurchase the game, so they can make money off of you.

I will definitely not be returning to any Rockstar Games, if the Ban System is this bad. It is just not fair for any players who purchased a copy of this game (Normal Players and Casual Players). In my opinion, the modders and hackers in this game ruins the experience for other players.",0
10586,"(TL;DR) Generally speaking, Grand Theft Auto V is a (kinda) nice game. For overall (PERSONAL) rating, scroll down till the end of this thread.

THE STORY MODE:

The story mode, is fine and maybe funny...For the first 2 hours at most, that is. It's a non-realistic scenario, that I would understand if it was a different type of game, but it's way too f'd up for me to be in the GTA franchise. Moreover, Single Player is pretty boring by itself, mostly because there's nothing different throughout the whole game. EVERY single mission, from start to finish, is practically the same. Steal cars, escape from the police, take the mission item to its destination, MAYBE get paid just a little bit if not at all. Quick parenthesis for the ones who will buy/bought the game for SP only, you won't get any (""Decent"") money until the very end, where you'll have to do the last ""Big shot"" heist. Strangers and freaks...Meh. Not even worth mentioning. Fillers (supposedly to add to the gameplay) that just make the story mode even more boring, personally speaking. Also, one more drawback of SP is that cars, apartments and businesses, all cost the same - if not more - than what they do in Online. Money cannot be split between characters, consecutively having to grind even more to purchase something. Overall, story mode is not even good, cliches everywhere, stupid puns and gags that I would not have expected to become so irritating after a bit and comedy is tiring. Not rewarding at all, till (as I stated above) the very end of the story and grinding becomes too mainstream after a while. Generally, the only thing I found exciting in the whole Story Mode, was the Rampage events with Trevor, where you go full insanse and on a killing spree against gangs and hipsters, that was fun.

GTA ONLINE:

On the other side, GTA Online is really fun with or without friends. Excluding those annoying players that have reached a really high position throughout the years, that just roam around the map and kill other, lower level and inexperienced players, GTA Online - even in free roam - would be a really good, huge part of the game that is really worth it. Character creation and customization in general (cars, hair styles, tattoos etc.), are really cool and I'd also like to add revolutionary, when compared to previous releases that had minimal and more restricted customizations. First Pirson, even though I do not like it, is really cool if you wanna mess around with civilians and cops. Middle fingering everybody makes them freak out and start swearing you, which - in my opinion - is a nice little feature that they added. Additionally, Online, has so many more activities than Single Player: From robbing a store (which is included in the Story but of course is more enthralling in Online) to gang shootouts against other, real life players, to races (in water, on the asphalt, even in the air) to team deathmatches. There's also another little feature that I really like, which is the ""Mental State"". Basically, the more you commit crimes, the more this Mental State bar rises, which makes you wanted even amongst other individuals in the same session as you and if the wanted person is killed, the killer is rewarded with RP and some cash. There are also some newly-introduced characters in the Multiplayer, that makes the game more fun and less mainstream. Ongoing events are also present all the time, which guarantees you a quick buck and some RPs to rank up faster. Ranking up, is also fast when doing activities. There are, however, cons in the Multiplayer as well. First and foremost, lots and lots and lots of hackers and cheaters, which Rockstar has not yet countered. In the discussions, you'll see tons of people complaining about randomly getting cash and then getting banned, or getting banned unjustly for no reason whatsoever. Fortunately, I still haven't gotten anything regarding penalties, not small, not big ones either and with some luck maybe I'll never get one. Oh! One thing I forgot to mention is: GTA V guarantees you 2 modes and 1 DLC, even when purchasing the standard edition. These are, Single Player and Multiplayer along with the Loading Simulator DLC. If you have enough patience then go ahead and buy this, but if you're willing to play Online only and you don't have, then you'll still have to have a lot of it. Honestly, from the ~145 hours I've got in this game, 10 hours might be loading screens, not even kidding. Sometimes, after having waited roughly 7-10 minutes, it puts you in an empty session, so you'll be forced to search for another session, unless you wanna mess around in free roam and don't want others to bother you, but even though you'll be searching for another session, it takes about 1 minute to enter the other one. Grinding becomes even harder in Mutliplayer, as players many times leave (your) lobbies (/-y) and as a result, you'll have to hamper (=Pause)  your grinding for once more. In addition to that, supercars, bunkers, stuff like that, have huge requirements (in cash) in order to be purchased, plus, modding and customizing these takes some pretty big sums of cash too. Last but not least, if you die and have to restart, you'll have to see every cutscene from the last checkpoint AND if somebody leaves the lobby, you'll have to go through (AGAIN) all of the lobby waiting and loading screens in order to do the activity from the beginning.

To sum everything up:
Graphics: Awesome! / 9/10
Sounds and Sound Effects: Really Good. / 8/10
Gameplay, Single Player: Bad. / 3.5/10
Gameplay, Online: Pretty Good. / 7.5 (Would've put 9/10 if it was not for the Loading Simulator)

10588,"I dunno why, but the I lag like hell. And the controls are annoying. I tried to exit a menu on GTA online and all it did was softlock the game making it so I couldn't move. I like the game, no really I do, It's just that the roads are missing textures and that it took me 7 days to download this thing. Maybe in another time, but I didn't like my first impression with this game. If you've got a good computer go ahead buy it. But be warned if your computer isn't the most compatible it will be hell for you.

Edit: I've recently gotten a computer upgrade and let me just say that I had to redo the opening heist twice because the game softlocked and I had to force quit it. Also I played GTA online and actually got to play it and some bitch was just spawn camping me with a helecopter. Maybe the online match making sucks because this game doesn't have any new players that want to keep playing this game when people that know what they're doing prevent you from getting a hang of the controls.",0

The game is fun and I recommend buying it but spect to be playing the online mode more than the story mode.
Also very good optimization so I guarantee you'll get 60fps at 720p or 1080p without problem.",0
10590,Good Game!,1
10591,"Game has good points but negative points are covering them, I won't write any of the good points.
Negative Points;
*TOO MANY CHEATERS AND ROCKSTAR DOING NOTHING BUT JERKING ALL DAY.
*TOO MUCH LAG
*SHITTY SERVERS
That negative points are fucking the experience and joy of the game...
And one last thing, Fuck all of cheaters' mothers and all other female members in their family.

My rating to this game is 2/10
Not worth to buy and play

The game is great and beautiful overall if we're talking about story mode, online however is a totally different thing. Its just a blatant cashgrab at this point as its a full priced game with microtransactions. What with the new Doomsday Heists Rockstar is basically giving a big middle finger to those that don't have the money to start the heists themselves, let alone complete it with the difficulty being incredibly difficult. In addition to that, the amount of hackers in this game are immersurable and with Rockstar not banning these players, I doubt you'll be able to have a fun time in an online public lobby without hackers griefing you half of the time. Lastly, they aren't even able to maintain the servers properly, what with it taking forever to load into a public lobby when you first start the game, and not even considering the number of times you will probebly get disconnected in the middle of heists.

10634,"As someone who's bought the game on 360 back when it was only available on those generation of consoles, it was a very well made game.

It still is a great game; why do I not recommend it then?

The Online. It can be fun, but as a lot of other players said, to experience all of the new content that's added. You have to play and play this game for days and weeks on end just to get what you want without buying the Shark cards. Perhaps you could call it ""pay to win"", but you're not really ""winning"". Instead, you're just paying actual money to get in-game currency just so you don't have to waste an insane chunk of time to experience what the newer updates have to offer. I'm not a huge online player, and I've never gotten beyond Rank 30 on my 360 as I liked this game more for the singleplayer aspect of it. Sadly, there's only so much you can do before it's too boring and you want something more. Suppose you want to install mods; well, that's great...for a while. Again, that eventually gets boring overtime.

Then there's the cheater problem. When I do play online though, I'm not playing on a public session anyways, so I've not experienced any cheaters. However, there's tons of reports from others saying that there's absolute TONS of cheaters just spawning in tons of cheated money. I don't know if you'll get banned randomly or not. Rockstar said that you won't as long as you didn't ask for it, but people said they've been banned for no reason.

I really suggest that you don't pick this game up unless it's on a heavy discount. Many of you already played the singleplayer anyways, and it offers very little more features compared to the 360/PS3. If you want to play Online and you're thinking that you're going to get all of the content unlocked very quickly without tedious grinding, think again. I'm only like Rank 10 on the PC version since I never wanted to pull my data from the 360 anyways, but I really don't have the time to sit there for days and days, and neither do others, playing this game to rack in a few million even though everything newer costs well over that few million.

Pretty much, Rockstar kind of trashed the Online aspect by making it very tedious and pushing you to buy their Shark cards for money that still won't pay for a lot. I'm sorry, but you gotta pass on this game if you've already did everything on singleplayer on a console. It's not worth $59.99.",0

But roaming in the big world full with hackers is not much fun.
Most of the new content such as houses, cars and other cool stuff can be bought for 1.000.000 of cash so it's difficult to afford unless you grind for many hours or pay $15 per 1m of cash u want to spend on stuff.

Great writing great charicters, ive played it through a few times over the years and still like it.
( but i feel like that no great feat from rockstar they are a huge company and have made great games before)

Now lets talk about online...
I held back from buying this game because of all the texts warning me not to play online alone so when a sale came alone a friend and i bought it and instantly started playing online, it started out interesting, its hard to find jobs to do, its borderline impossible to play in a game with your friends unless you host, but i would hardly call it a host position, you have little to no control over the loby.

I could go on and on and on but you know the real reason im writing this?
Because i sloged away at online for 20 solid hours only to have a hacker come in and sell everything i owned for himself and ROYALY fuck the game turning it into a unfixable, glichy mess not to mention all that hardwork was for nothing.

Oh and also there is no legit way to contact rockstar to get this problem sorted so F********************K YOOOOOOOOU ROCKSTARRRRRRRRR!

10673,"I've never owned a Rockstar game before two weeks ago... I'm not a fanboy saying this: F Rockstar.

I got the game as an early Xmas gift... two weeks I played up until Xmas... put in the grind, loving it, racking up 700K in game and a couple low level properties...

Then on Christmas, Rockstar offers everyone a free ""Hermes"" muscle car... all you have to do is order in ingame from the dealer, ""free"" on the site, and it will be delivered... well, myself, along with countless others, clicked for the free car... YAY!

But then the game deducted the cost of the car, 535K (70% of what it took me two weeks to earn)...

It's a cool car, but I would have never spent that money on that... 500K in game is 10$ real life money in their microtransacrtions... I wouldn't have paid 5K in game for that car, cool as it is... 

Well now Rockstar is apparently making it right for some, and not others... I sit here days later waiting, along with many others, for the refund that they said on their support site was coming...

Well it comes for some and not others... as I type this, people are posting screen shots of their refunds...

I don't know why this is so hard... If I drop 10$ on a card shark, that money would be in my account right now... why can't they do the same for a refund?

And is that refund ever coming at all?

Did they somehow determine that only some of us actually deserve the refund? Did they determine I did something wrong? (I don't mod, clean install, and have a perfect VAC record in many years on Steam)...

This whole things is BS...

This is no way to run a company.

Again: not fanboy anger... this is empirically wrong.

It's a fantastic game... I've loved every minute of it... I'll keep playing it... but I'm not spending any of the other Xmas money I have on steam, on these guys...

I won't give Rockstar another dime. Ever. Fantastic introduction you guys made to me...


---


On December 28th, Rockstar corrected my account for the amount that was taken for the 'free' car... some people are still waiting...

---

It's absolutely BS to be working so hard on a mission only to have some kid destroy your cargo from the safety of his office with one button...

Stupidest mechanic in the world... there is no defense for it. Just a blatant griefing tool.

---

Still playing it a lot a month plus after getting the game... I love the game but:

You have to do things to make a session conducive to playability... griefers are everywhere, on every server... so you have to fudge the game to get a private server for you and your friend to get 20 minutes of grief free play...

You can save up all your money, or spend on sharks, to buy that tank to attempt to slow down the griefing, only to be met by some kid with 134253561 billion hacked dollars, who can destroy you instantly with the game's legit magic button...

I'm sure you will think: someday I'll have the toys and beat those griefers... but you won't... unless you hack too.

---

It's unlike any other game: it's absolutely a blast when it goes well... but you're going to have to bend the rules and research tricks just to get some decent play time in.

---

And don't fall for any of the ""we'll give you X amount of money if you do this..."" promotions... I'm still waiting on the 200k I was supposed to get for signing up for their mailing list... and I'm still waiting on the 1.25 million I was supposed to get for buying a single 20$ shark during an exclusive promotion that was available to me in a loading screen...

They're a clumsy company with a great product... unfortunately the company is entrenched in the gameplay, so does affect you.

I play this game a lot... more than any other game I own right now... but I only enjoy it because I bend the mechanics of the game to play without grief. If you cannot do this, or if this is a pain for you, you will not enjoy this game.

Unless you like grief, I cannot recommend this game.

If you'll buy GTA V for the online aspect alone I do not recommend you to do so, but if you want to replay the single player aspect (and get heaps of fun running amok with Trevor) then I highly recommend it. Treat the online aspect of the game as bonus content and you'll not be dissappointed.",1

  Print print this recipe
Ingredients
1 Tbsp	Olive oil
20 g	Butter
1	Leek, cut off the top green stalk, use only the white part, trim, slice in half lengthwise and then slice finely
100 g	Mushrooms, cleaned and finely chopped
800 g	Chicken thighs, diced
1 Tbsp	Flour
1 handful	Sage leaf, finely chopped
200 g	Creme fraiche
2 Tbsp	Dijon mustard
2 sheets	Flaky puff pastry, we used Paneton
1 large	Egg, beaten + add to shopping list
Directions

Heat oven to 200C. In a large frying pan melt the oil and butter, then add the leek and mushrooms. Fry gently until the leeks soften. Transfer the leek and mushrooms to a bowl. Put the pan back on the heat.
Toss the chicken with flour and some salt and pepper. Next add the chicken to the hot frying pan and cook until all sides are golden brown. Add the sage, creme fraiche, mustard and mushroom and leek mixture.
If you have individual pie ramekins, turn one ramekin upside down on the pastry and using a knife cut out the pastry to create a top for the pie. You can skip this step if you are making one large pie.
Divide the mixture among 4 individual ramekins or one baking dish. Cover with puff pastry cut-outs or roll the sheet over and seal on top of your baking dish. Brush the egg wash on the top of the pastry. Cut a slit on each pie (4 slits if using the large baking dish). Place in the top half of the oven and cook for 20 minutes until the pastry is golden.",1

Step 6: Lead brief chase across city trying to escape said player.

10723,"This is the 3rd time I bought this game, and I mainly bought it to mess around with mods in Single Player, as GTA Online is a cesspool of pain and misery. Seriously, if you want to have fun in Online you should have played two years ago, because otherwise those days are gone with just the endless grind to get anything of substance. Besides, you can get all ""Online only"" content in SP with mods so you aren't missing much on terms of content asides from missions, and the modding community has you covered on that as well. However, you better have some serious hardware available if you want to run it properly,  as this game is highly CPU intensive and will often push the limits of what your rig can do. However, if you can run the game, get it, the story is an amazingly polished and enjoyable single player experience that really can only be found from a Rockstar Games title.",1

10742,"**DISCLAMER**
This is my personal opinion on the game. Dont get butthurt please.

Good game but you need friends in order to have fun. I mean you can almost do anything from selling coke to stealing cargo in order to sell it on the stock market. But solo is boring AF. At least 3 people required to have a good time.

    ********* EDIT *********
*Story:

 The story is ok. Not better than GTA IV and not even close to GTA SA but its ok and its fun, even though R* still own us a f*cking Story Mode DLC but whatever.

*Online:

After a month (After the new update) I can say that the Online experiance is out of f*cking controll. Before Doomsday Heist the game was OK. It was fun with friends and all but after the new update the game has gone to sh*t. A game that you suppose to start as a Hustler and slowly progress in order to become a Kingpin has gone to Nuclear Warfare and WW3. Hell, this aint GTA no more. Its fucking WW3 simulator. FFS R* the online has gone to absolute SH*T. 

*Conclusion:

If you are looking to buy the game grab it while its on sale cause this game aint worth more than 25 bucks anymore. If you pay full price you just wasted your savings. You will enjoy the Story but you will find the Online kinda weird. Old school players like me that we used to play on Old Gen (PS3, Xbox360) will remember the good old days of hustling and grinding. 

Peace. Im out.",0
10743,"I really love this game, it makes it alot fun join other players online and doing missions with them and 
 alot of activities you can do online but there is one problem online you will have to avoid Modders 
 and Hackers online and its possible they can drop fake or modded money on to you and I have encountered some of players doing that, however I rather go play online with myself or friends sessions that way I could avoid them doing it so pretty much the gameplay is good and its got good stuff online so far and I do love the updates their putting in such as Heist Missions, New Vehicles, Weapons, Outfits and many more.

They can just make new social club accounts

10820,"Me and my buddies mostly play in a session together (and block everyone else out of the session). Two of them were banned, for the same reason - losing connecting to the game constantly for a few days because of internet stability issues. That's right, if you constantly lose connection to Rockstar's servers, you will be banned and you cannot appeal it under any circumstances, along with having your account wiped.

Now, they have ripped 2 million out of my account for no apparent reason. I have never received modded money, and especially not 2 million worth. All my friends have lost between 800k and 2mil. We normally only play in a session together, so I have no idea how we could have received so much modded money.

The game itself is great, however I cannot recommend a game from a company with such an appalling way to deal with their customers. The game's multiplayer is a P2P system rather than dedicated servers, a part of the reason for the massive amount of cheating in this game - and it will always be like this as long as there are no dedicated servers. I have lost trust in Rockstar because who knows, I might log on one day and be randomly banned and lose everything without being able to appeal.",0

UPDATED ""17 August 2020"" 

Rockstar Games fail making their server any save for the actual hard worker (Amazon Servers btw). *Shit nerver Changes. Anti-Hack Background software... keep dreaming....

Lets not forget the Epic ""Give Away"" fiasco...
THX Epic for bringing f*cking banned idiots back and basicly give 95% of the lobbys to Russian Hackers and Banned Morrons.

The community is strash (unless ofc) you get lucky and find some actual good ""sports"" players. (kinda found a hell of good friends there that are actually good people and not just ur casual friend to ""help me sell this"")

And the latest (DLC's) ""cough"" apart from broke, expensive and p2w bs <- this remains 1. <- 17 August 2020, Told you S*th never changes, the Yatch is usules, ( 6 missions added, fun but doesnt last long), ""i wanna sink that shit""

 OverF*ckingPriced Stuff, ""Summer Special DCL"" ima die rn this is bs, dont know why ya keep reading... srsly 15mil just like that for 2 f1 cars that are just like the old ones, 5 rides(or 6??? idk, i lost my memory after the 12th full garage"". SO yeah get thouse 15mil ready boies cus R* loves sucking ya monies!

And if you are from portugal Forget the Casino DLC we are GeoLocked dont try VPN's it fckes up your online save game (tested). <--- Still 1
Please R* just ask for a damn Portuguese Lawyer to fix this casino bs. its legal -.-  <---- (They never will...)

in the end after idk 3k hours of this crap, i dont feel it anymore, its just more of the same bs.

and oooh...

The playerbase is murderous and full of hackers, and if you get caught in the hacker crossfire, Rockstar will punish you for it. Which is especially sour when you save up for a certain thing, and they just out of the blue remove 80% of everything you have, under the pretense that it is ""hacker money"".

Now, with 4,000+ hours of playing time and never using an exploit, cheat, glitch, hack, beg/accepted money from hackers, how come I am punished by having my money taken away from me? Never once did I do any of those things and R* punishes me. Not only that but I still didn't get all the stuff from the gunrunning dlc. That doesn't even include all the things I wanted to get from previous dlc. 4000 hours and still not able to get everything from a single dlc. Way to go R* for making everything so expensive and punish innocent people like me just because I'm trying to grind my money to purchase said dlc. 

I would say wait for this game to be on sale for 30 bucks to buy it because the single player is amazing. As for the online mode, it is a waste of time and money as R* never fixes the problems and blames the innocent people for its unfairness and treats hackers like they are the gods of the game.

10858,"Dont purchase this game. The developers show no concern for the playerbase and will do whatever it takes to squeeze every last cent they can from the loyal fans that the company has no regard for. They go after singleplayer modding tools that have been active for years and have no affect on online in an attempt to curb multiplayer hacking, which accomplished nothing as the hackers online still flourished while punishing players. Alot of players got so fed up with the joke that is GTA Online and have reverted to playing singleplayer with mods, which is and always has been ""Officially allowed"" by Rockstar. Then they tried to shut down the SP modding tool, forcing the SP players to play Online for their entertainment, then being subject to the teeming mass of hackers that run rapant in Online lobbies. Rockstar's regular release of ""FreeLC"" increasingly supports a Pay 2 Win dynamic, where the in game content being induced is becoming increasingly more expensive. Rockstar's goal is to reinforce the need for their in game micro transactions, ""Shark Cards"". Which allow players to substitute grinding for hours on end for in game progress, to paying real currency in exchange for in game currency. Even as the in game content becomes increasingly, obscenely highly priced, the Shark Card value / exchange rate / prices have not been altered since the game was released, When the game was released, a megalodon Shark Card ($100 USD for 8 Million GTA$) would get players along way. Now, with the years of in game ""inflation"", that particular Shark Card, which still costs $100 USD for $8,000,000 in game, can barely go as far as to purchase FOUR of the new vehicles, if even at that. Rockstar offers no real in game alternative to Shark Cards. The Heists payout is a joke compared to the price of everything else in game, and that's if you could even get a heist succesfully completed. Rockstar has also been confiscating ""suspicious money"" from players in an attempt to curb ill gotten gains via hacking, but has seemed to affect money gotten legitimately from players 80% of the time. Their customer support is a joke, and is a running joke in the video game standard, widely regarded as the worst, period, by many. Do yourself a favor, Don't purchase this game. Dont purchase future GTA Titles unless Rockstar completely overhauls the entire game dynamic.",0

Rockstar has been milking this game for almost 3 and going on to 4 years with the sharkcard system, but if you are a decent human and have any societal values then the only way to get gud at this game is to put a lot of time into grinding as the system is specifically designed to lure players into buying sharkcards to avoid spending time and putting in real time effort when it can all be obtained with small payment of 50$ and one click.",1
10901,"I used to absolutely love GTA V, I played it a fair amount of hours and enjoyed both the single player and online experience with friends.

The first few weeks of doing heists felt amazing and walking away with solid cash after we all worked together as a team flawlesly felt like a totally new experience. Even the times when we messed up a heist in a hilarious way it still felt worth it.

Hours of freeroaming never got boring either, and with the constant DLC updates adding new cars, races, guns, houses and so on they kept the game feeling fresh. 

But I hear you say: But that's all positive why are you giving it a bad text!?

First of all, the hackers, it started with money hacks, people spamming bags of cash everywhere. This obviously wasn't the worst but then came the aimbots, godmode and at the end of the hackerfest came the button that made an entire server die. Server being innacurate as the way the servers are run are still peer-to-peer as far as I know. (This being a huge part of the problem).

The comunity has never been the most friendly one but has still become more salty as time went by. Rockstar seems to have implemented more and more of a pay-to-win policy where vehicles with high prices are virtually indestructible and have over the top weapons and abilities. 

As a final nail in the coffin for me I recently got word that one of the most famous modding tools for GTA V has received a cease and desist, forcing them to shut down their tool completely or risking a huge expensive lawsuit if they didn't comply. 

The way Rockstar treats the fanbase and the modders who are only trying to create new and fun experiences on a game that seems to be dying slowly is just a big no-no to me. 

Policies like this seem to have been a trend in the industry for the last years and I highly encourage everyone to let companies know this is not the way to handle things.

the only thing that i can think off that probably deemed punishable by Rockstar is that we NEVER buy any of that shark card thing..... is not buying any shark card breaking the EULA ? because if not i have no idea what me and my brother do wrong.... (/s)

Also this is my first time banned in AN ONLINE GAME ever, and i didn't even do anything.


at least that OPENIV thing sorted out, since I can't refund the game anymore, i'll see if can MOD the SINGLEPLAYER game to my enjoyment.

10929,"Let me split this text into 3 sections. One for the Online mode, One for the Single-player and one for the Modded RP side of things.

Online: At first I loved Online and I love Rockstar but they have just riddled this game with micro-transactions and their ""Shark Cards"". Its pretty much just a huge circle that goes as follows; They announce a new DLC that has the new fastest car that everyone wants and adds some kind of gimmicky vehicle that you'll enjoy for 20 minutes then either sell it or let it collect dust in the garage. Next, the brand new fastest car costs a fortune and you can either spend a week to try to get enough money to purchase it or to buy a ""Shark Card"" to instantly get it with your real life, hard earned cash. Then, in a few days or maybe even a week you will get burnt out until they announce another new DLC which is exactly the same as the last one but with a new skin on it. With the brand new fastest car and that new gimmicky vehicle that they have to add. + its riddled with hackers and cheaters.

Singleplayer: The singleplayer storyline is FENOMINAL. I can't even describe how great it is when a young poor criminal (Franklin) meets up with an old ex-criminal under witness protection (Micheal) who tries to help the young poor criminal get some ill-gotten cash which then the old ex-criminals partner who is some twisted redneck (Trevor) figures out where he lives to get revenge.
Im bad at explaining things but its just great and it is a somewhat lengthy story aswell which is always a plus.

Modded RP: The modded RP scene is still in development but so far its great and its all fun. It already has a lot of the functunality of SA:MP (San Andreas Multiplayer) and if not more. It seems very promising and I can't wait to see what it leads to.

Overall, You could buy this game for the Single player and/or the modded RP. but Rockstar just can't stop milking their game of micro-transactions and it also doesnt help that the publisher of this game, Take Two, tried to take away pretty much the whole modding scene but thanks to the community, that didn't happen.

Are the words I would use to describe this game. With every update comes questionable decisions by the developers; Blatantly overpriced items, removing or restricting features, obscene waiting times for new features packaged within the update, and the same boring garbage as every other update.

On the surface, Grand Theft Auto Online seems like an amazing game, but as time has gone on, that surface grows ever thinner. It has gotten to the point where the newest updates are completely devoid of any semblance of quality or balance, and are packed full of content that exists for the sole purpose of pulling wallets out of pockets and setting them neatly into Rockstar's greedy hands. 

Every part of this game seems to just fuel the flow of money into the develepor's pockets. Every new vehicle or weapon is either overpriced and useless, or a powerful greifing tool, while every money-making method leaves you at the mercy of a lobby armed with such tools. Every gamemode that could be any fun at all has pay2win coursing through it's veins, as no win can ever be secured without paying, and half the time you have to pay up front anyway just to even have the pleasure of losing.

On top of this, most harmless or fun bugs are patched almost immediately, even while the game is still riddled with cheaters and modders after all this time.

This is the one game where you can spend $10 of real life money on cargo, spend hours collecting them, and then have ALL of it go to waste when a modder kills you instantly. (Or just some trigger-happy greifer, in case the modders are asleep)

I'd give the game a second thumbs down if I could",0
10947,"This game is unacceptable in 2019. It screams 6th generation everywhere you go. Loading times are up to 5 minutes and changing anything in the video settings will restart the game - forcing you to wait another 5 minutes. I've had connection problems where it errored, threw me in the single player campaign for one second, then threw me again into the loading screen for multiplayer. 

Playing this game after almost 3 years felt weird, as the was a shitfest of events and confusing disclamers all over the screen. There was a competition for who could fall the greatest height without a parachute open, that popped on the screen out of nowhere, having no cancel button and me not giving any consent to participating. 

I wanted to visit these new night clubs. I went ahead into one, started dancing and was confused by the controls, so I brang up the legend. As I opened it up, the night club closed and threw me on the street. I guess I glitched it somehow, as it put me in a state where buttons didn't respond to my commands. Only fix was to restart the damn game, waiting for another 5 minutes to load

Being that the online mode is full of content you can conclude that  they are trying to manipule their playerbase to spend all of there time playing online to increase there online cash sales. OpenIV allowed players to not only mod singleplayer content but also enjoy the singleplayer mode of this game with as much content as you want without playing online. Rockstar really did shoot themselves in the foot by putting an end to OpenIV.

10962,"Earlier this year, I gave a negative text to this game to join the rant band wagon.  Now, I am going to give my honest text.  However, I will only touch on the online a little, because that IS NOT GTA.

THE STORY:
I am by no means a fan of single player games.  I prefer online, co-op killing action.  With that being said, GTA V NEVER failed to grab my attention with the story.  You are given plenty of options throughout your playthrough (such as killing someone, or leaving them alive) that impact the game.  The characters are without a doubt some of the greatest voice actors in recent video game history.  There is not a character in the game that isn't unique, and each one has an incredible backstory that you learn more about when you progress through the game.  There are also random events throughout the game that keep even the most basic driving exciting.  If it was from story alone, this game would EASILY get a 10/10.

THE WORLD:
When it comes to the design and detail of Los Santos, I can promise that there is not a better open world in the gaming industry.  The colors are vibrant, the world feels alive, and the designs of certain areas are pure perfection.  Only games like ""The Witcher 3"" can compare, so if that is something that you have played, you will be able to appreciate this world.  The parodies are a major bonus as well.

THE GAMEPLAY:
I consider this the weakest link of GTA.  The hand to hand combat in the game is a major down grade from GTA IV, but the guns are a major improvement.  Everything feels very smooth for the most part during combat.  The cops function very well, and work as a cooperative unit.  The cars all feel amazing, and have unique traction and speed.  

CUSTOMIZATION:
From clothing items, to paint jobs, GTA does not fail to embrace the freedom of choice.  You can completely change cars that you buy from the vast Internet that was created.

THE ONLINE:
GTA Online feels almost nothing like the actual game.  However, it is still one of the best open world games you can play with your friends.  It is not nearly as fun without friends though.  The Online also fails at producing a fair market.  The amount of money that you earn is not nearly enough to purchase what you want, and it has been a major complaint from the beginning.  It is a shame that they have not yet added more housing or heists, but there is still plenty to do.  Shark cards are ridiculously overpriced, so I would recommend staying away from them.  Hackers are also very common.

THE VERDICT: 
GTA earns a 9/10!
The base game is absolutely amazing and the game is definitely worth the purchase.  IF you are going to play online, make sure to grab friends!",1

10967,"After trying to force players to buy ingame currency by releasing more and more powerful items for astronomical high prices (worth 700h of grinding OR 500 US-$ of ingame currency for the content of ONE SINGLE DLC) the developer and its publisher Take-Two-Interactive decided that this wasn't enough. 

Here is a quote from the CEO of Take-Two Interactive:""We are convinced that we are probably from an industry view UNDERMONETIZING on a per-user basis. There is wood to chop because I think we can do more [...]""

Following this statement they shut down the most popular tool for creating singleplayer mods. One might suspect they are doing this to force players into multiplayer (and ultimately buying ingame currency). 
The company's stance is already clear when watching their neglect of singleplayer content and pretty much exclusive focus on the more lucrative multiplayer part. 

For the reasons mentioned above I can not recommend this game.",0
10968,Rockstar is a horrible company. I don't need to say anymore.,1
10969,Screw Take Two. Disgusting disnuness practices.,0
10970,"No Mods = No game

So FUCK you take two",0
10971,"No mod support for single player rip.

Edit: Still gonna keep this a thumbs down for even considering ending mod support.",0
10972,"Hordes of cheaters, broken PvP balance, cheap automated support, zero fcks given by Rockstar to any problem.",0
10973,"Its a grindfest. Jobs failing to download, a friend being unable to load into the mission. Teleporting npcs, npc cars appearing out of thin air, hitting your car then returning to the void. Import/Export cars could explode if you lose connection to the public lobby you're in.  Unless you're planning to play with friends, cheaters are a common thing in public lobbies. Even if you want to play with friends, some heist missions are buggy and can run into a lot connection problems. Prison break finale has a bug where the plane and its passengers cant lose their wanted level and therefore cannont finish the finale. Suiciding means you start from the start since that was the only checkpoint in the finale mission.

However, if you're only planning on playing the single-player campaign. Enjoy! Don't forget about mods.",0
10974,"Not only do you have to spend all your precious time/money on super expensive vehicles and weaponry, but you spend all your precious time/money to watch your account get banned for MSI, though they let griefing hackers get away with mod menus. 

8m in-game = 100$

Cost of Oppressor (funnest thing in the game, flying bike) = 3.5m

I rather not spend 50 dollars to experience fun that's soon to be ruined by some griefer. 

Also fuck you Take 2 for removing mod support. Maybe if you'd make your game correctly, people wouldn't have to take it into their own hands.",0
10975,"I loved this game but given the recent actions of the developer against the modding community, I cannot recommend it at all.",0
10976,mods are cool but the game is grindy. be prepared to grind...or beg for some money drops,0
10977,"Dumped single player content in favour of selling more Shark cash cards. Banned mods because they believed the mod creators were making money off them (they aren't). How long until mods are reintroduced, but you have to use ""credits"" or some other bullshit to pay for them. Anything for a dollar.",0
10978,this game is the criminal of gaming,0
10979,garbage,0
10980,Very bad game in general they treat the players of their games that cost a shit ton of money badly. I think if someone deserves to be shut down it should be rock star they give players no freedem in the game originally or we would not have to mod in the first place. Peace rockstar im out.,0
10981,"The game adds 40 million dollars of DLC every 2 months, thats about 400 hours of grinding every 2 months. That is not reasonable. Fix the broken rewards and grinding time or else we the players will resort to other options. I have never downloaded a hack before for a videogame, but GTAV is the closest I have ever come. I can not reccomend this game in its current broken and unbalanced state.",0
10982,"GTA V is a well made game and very fun. That being said, Rockstar has become a prime example of the satirical, superficial America it portrays in its game. The Pay-to-Win/Pay-to-have-maximum-fun marketing strategies as well as the recent removal of mods support for single player and overall anti-modding attitude taken by Rockstar and Take Two Interactive has made this game as well as the companies a shadow of their former self.",0
10983,"So harmless modding isn't allowed, but you can't do anything about the countless hackers online? Hilarious.",0
10984,"Take 2 shut down the main modding tool in hopes of driving more people into multiplayer but they ended up driving me out of the game entirely. if you are looking for singleplayer fun beyond what the base game can offer, this is no longer the game for you.",0
10985,"When they ban you for no reason all you have left are mods to entertain you, now they're taking that away. 

great game",0
10986,"I have been playing this game since the initial release on the xbox 360. I migrated to PC when the pc version came out, I am wholly disatisfied with Rockstar and what is basically extortion on their part. No vehicle is worth $30 of real world currency. And they can't even argue that money can be earned in a reasonable amount of time without purchasing shark cards, I do not find the activities apart from freeroam entertaining, meaning in order for me to aquire the new and exciting vehicles, I am literally being forced to buy shark cards to obtain them. I have never seen a greater disrespect for the gaming community, and never expected it from a company like Rockstar and Take Two. They have ruined the reputation of a company that has been know to make fantastic story driven games, to line their own pockets. Greed has so blatently taken over Rockstar and Take two, that I dont see them restoring their reputation to its former glory. Complete disgust, and sadness, have overtaken my former opinion of Rockstar and Take Two.",0
10987,"Was decent, but the Rockstar is taking this game in the wrong direction.",0
10988,"Oh, little Strauss Zelnick is not happy with players that dont spend money on GTA online and only plays offline mods? Go to hell T2.",0
10989,You really messed up homies,0
10990,"I actually disliked this game before this whole fiasco with OpenIV, but this just added fuel to the fire. The game originally had plans for more offline content, which, frankly speaking, it desperately needed after ripping out San Fierro and Las Venturas, and proceeded to start charging, AGAIN, after the initial $60 dollars on release for in-game currency, which basically made this game a p2w Online experience, which is absolutely inexcusible. The thought that they thought they could cease development of two expansions like they once did with GTA IV, and just sit back on shitty micro-transactions just comes to show what R* has devolved to.

R* basically showed a notable decline of content with the release of this game. GTA SA still has replayability value, which is impressive to say the least about a game of its age. Not many games survive the test of time. I don't think this one will.",0
10991,"still cheaters but a lot less of it these days, casino heist is amazing",1
10992,This is some serious bullcrap. Attacking creative community and trying to fake that you have a good reason. This company is done for.,0
10993,Wow,1
10994,"Fuck these devs, fuck Take Two. They make bullshit crap that we dont ask for, that can only be play in multiplayer. They abandoned single player content. And just recently they shut down all modding possiblities. I DONOT reccomend this game or anything else owned by Rockstar. They want your money and all of it.",0
10995,DO NOT BUY. Game developers starts treathning gamers that have made them a fortune and sold many copies of the game. Please avoid at all cost.,0
