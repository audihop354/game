3,"ORIGINAL REVIEW Posted: Nov 27, 2016:
Extremely fun and addictive game! That IS if you practice and learn the way the game is supposed to be played.

Actually requires a lot of patience, aim control, learning of map locations, etc.

Edit Dec 7, 2018: Stupid crazy full with hackers, now that it's F2P i feel like it's gonna get taken over by even more hackers... RIP 2012 CSGO.

EDIT 2021/09/03: Some of you are morons here... Clearly a huge ""fan"" base of CSGO. I've gathered around 9,000+ hours in total (in my other account as well) No. I wasn't a ""Noob"" or had no skill. I was GE for a very long time.

This review is from 2018. After all the new updates came into place. I LOVED the game, It was my addiction. After those updates, everything went down hill. MORE toxicity, MORE blatant hackers, and I for one wasn't a big fan of the newest updates. So I decided to leave, updated this review with my most recent experience.

Valve you are actually fucking retarded what the fuck
Here's literally the simplest way we can tell you how to fix this:
- Fix VAC
- Fix Prime
- Fix Bugs
- Don't put a BR into a competitive FPS game
- And don't fucking make the game free to play and then give everyone a coin for being retarded and actually buying this game.

There was zero communication between CSGO and the players, you legit just asked if we were free Wednesday, and now I wish I was busy so I never would of have to play this.

EDIT: A more structured, critical review.

I decided to try the game again to give a better review rather than just lashing out at what I saw earlier, and in a completely honest way, I'm still unhappy, but not as unhappy as I was prior. I still love this game if it is not evident by the number of hours that I have on my account. But still, I have some critiques on this.

The Battle Royale
When I heard the idea of a battle royale in CS, I was against it, they've never quite been my thing and the popularity of games like fortnite completely destroyed any hope that I had for battle royales in games. However, CSGO's battle royale does have some pros with some cons at the same time. Do take into account that I am biased against battle royales.
Pros:
- It's a fresh new take on the battle royale genre.
- Thing like escorting hostages add a great addition to the game mode as a way to get money whilst still being involved with anything around you.
- The idea of choosing and seeing where others drop is a nice feature.

Cons (take into account I am biased against battle royales):
- It doesn't fit well into a CS game, yes I understand that I don't have to play it but it does my head in that it's advertised on the main screen.
- Ammo is actually harder to find than real life aliens, the fact that you pick ammo up 1 by 1 doesn't make this any easier.
- Drones break if there is a ledge near where you are standing. I bought some ammo and the drone was confused if an inanimate wall was actually me.
- The amount of actual shake you receive when getting hit is akin to an earthquake, given I had some fun with my friends going around and bashing people to the point where it's like the Negev in warmup.
- Finally, it's a battle royale. You didn't have to follow this trend CS, even if it was planned a while ago.

Free To Play
This is one of the more concerning things that I had with the update, CS is already filled with cheaters and can sometimes make the game so irritating that I've put it down for a couple weeks. As 3kliksphilip said its probably the game with the most cheaters (Does CS:GO Updates not entertain you) But now I have some confidence in their decision for making it free to play, it allows more people to experience CS and will most likely double the population which isn't a downside. The thought that Valve has made the game free to play shows that they have confidence in VAC and that VAC will learn a lot more things due to the games new state.

Prime
This issue is one of the main reasons that this review is staying as not recommended. The idea that you can pay into prime and that people who have already bought the game will now have instant prime. This kind of makes me think that prime will be reduced to a standard trust factor match which cheaters are somewhat abundant. But if Valve is confident enough in their VAC, this shouldn't be a problem. However, the amount of cheaters who have probably been grinding enough to get prime on multiple accounts is worrying.

Valve in General
My issue with prime has nothing on this. Valve don't really know much about their audience. We believe that we are entitled due to the amount of shit they have given us in the past years (AUG Week, R8's introduction *solved quickly, nerfing weapon speeds *this affected pros but they can manage now, #HikoMissed). My problem isn't really with this, it's with Valve's transparency, they never tell us what they're going to do and expect us to all love their new idea like its Chef Boyardee's canned pasta. No one has really ever asked for battle royale in CS, we ask for improvements which are normally disregarded.

In short, I'm upset with this update, but not as upset as I once was, I still have faith in Valve although it is withering at a fast pace.

Response to comments:
@PapaNotedVevo: Agreed that it makes the player base bigger, dislike the concept of battle royale in cs.
@JustSqueeze: Cause why can't I? As long as I have skins and fun with my friends then who cares?
@Count Chocula: H1Z1s peak player base was 150,179, it's now 24-hour peak is averaging the 3,000 range. This isn't good for a game, it puts people off from the original concept.
@thehemmo: Yeah I agree with you now my man.
@waffle.jpeg: I won't play it, I'm not being forced to. It's a bad addition to a competitive game and I won't play it anymore, regarding optimization, I'm glad you can run this on your 12 year old labtop as you said. And yeah I was probably wrong about the optimization thing, some of my friends with lower-end pc's still cannot run it. 
@RandyCo: Prime isn't mean to be something you can pay for, prime is meant to be for people who have played the long enough and deserve a place where they can play without cheaters, cool VACnet is enabled, I forgot that gets rid of every cheater ever, did you?

This is due to the cheating in this game. The entire community is nervous.
90% of games turns into salty game of people blaming everyone of cheating.
Sportsmanship is fading. Play one good game you get reported and end up in low trust factor.

Last contributing factor is the increasing amount of cheating in pro level games.

That way, the people who are stuck in MM cheating because they feel like they have no alternative, or have genuinely given up on the game, can finally go clean when they see the positive of a clean competitive game. Knowing that if they do it again in the new day and age of CS, they will be HWID banned. Then drop the hammer.

Was not expecting this review to blow up so much,

The day i wrote this i had just gotten out of a game of 3 hackers on the enemy team, These guys where spin botting. You can call me ""bad"" ""Terrible"" ""They're just better"" But iv been playing since 2013, I know who is legit and who is blatantly cheating.

Project A will not kill csgo, Its very different, looks more like overwatch. Im not afraid of csgo dying, but what i am worried about is new players dealing with cheating, Getting annoyed and then cheat themselves. This is why there are so many cheaters. VAC is not a good anti cheat.

I do not recommend buying prime unless your willing to deal with 5 days of cheaters, then hopefully having a good trust factor where there are no cheaters.


Valve, You should really implement a trust factor XP bar, or something so you can tell if yours is good or not. The current system is broken, You sometimes have cheaters with new accounts, and sometimes 5 year old players who are obviously not cheating. The current system is broken and needs to be fixed.

If you still sit here and think this is all bullshit, ill link a video soon, I bought a new account, and played 1 game, All good no cheaters, Played another one. Spinbotters who crash the server so they dont get Overwatched because it corrupts the demo. I have proof for all of this.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Initial Review 

Counterstrike is and always will be a amazing game. 
The reason its having its downfalls is due to the 78% of the community uses cheats. VAC is the WORST anti cheat there is out there, This is something a 12 year old could bypass in his computer class at school. You can code walls in less than 1 hour. Theres nothing protecting this game!!!!

VALVE project A will DESTROY CSGO if you do not implement another anti cheat. EAC is better than this garbage.

Honestly dont waste your money on this game if you have no trust factor or low, Queing with people who have Low Trustfactor is the worst thing you can do. Its all cheaters who HVH in MM. 

I suggest removing Trust Factor or fix it. I que with someone who gets a 7 day due to kicking players who fuck around in comp then he has Low Trust Factor, Then we que with hackers.

Please for FUCK Sakes valve fix your game. Remove these scums so us LEGIT old players actually have a fun time instead of leaving this game..

37,"4/10

Great game, with amazing potential. But lack of developer trancparency and rampant cheating will lead to it's downfall.

Lets start this off by saying V.A.C. is a joke... it doesn't do much other than be a meme for the community to bash on. Valve makes billions of micro transaction and yet does nothing to improve player experience by cracking down on cheater and hackers. Every low skill competetive game is full of smurfs (players with alot of experience playing in lower level games) and or hackers. Valves overwatch program catches non cheating players who happen to have a streak of good games/plays, and fails to capture the ""closet hackers"" - or people who using hacks, but play a style that makes it seem that don't. 

""Prime Matchmaking"" failed to deliver on it's goal of seperating out cheatings/smurfs from players who wan't to play against players their skill level and have a good time. It was a good idea, worked at first, but if a player can get a program undetectable by VAC, how hard is it for them to buy Prime Ready Accounts, and get access to a phone number?

Rumors have been spreading on community forums that Valve is in the works of a ""Super VAC"" yet it's been 5 or so years since the games launch, and they yet to deliver on anything more than in game accessories (gun skins, stickers, music kits, GLOVES, pins, etc) and questionable mechanic changes. I understand they want to make money - but who is going to buy their products when no one is around because of the shakey servers and toxic/hacking community.

I'm extremely disappointed in Valve - like many others, this review will get drowned in the vastness of QQ and phony reviews. There is only one way to getting Valve to act...

Boycott all Valve microtransactions. I'm am no longer buying any more products through Counter Strike or any other valve game until they make reforms to match making. When they have they revenue stream in jeopardy - only then will they listen to player/community concerns and start making changes we want/need to see.

For current players, I feel your struggle, hear your cries, and share your rage. Stop purchacing valve skins, keys, kits, pins, whatever. Stop using the community market and boycott all valve micro transactions.

For future players - hold off from playing this game, the current experience will only turn you away and make your want to quit before you have seen the small glimor of light that is the csgo community. As well, don't purchase the game unless you are ready to pay 5$ a month for a 3rd party subscrition in order to have a decent competetive experience.

TL:DR - Game has potential, but too many hackers. Valve doesnt do ENOUGH to remedy the issues.

48,"[h1][u]Main Review[/u][/h1] 

This review is carefully worded explanation on my 'departure' from CS:GO and why in its current state, I would not recommend the game. This is somewhat lengthy, so it is really down to you whether or not you actually decide to read it all. 

So, where do I begin? Well, after reaching the second highest matchmaking rank (Supreme Master First Class) in October 2015 and continuing to play CS:GO from there on throughout 2016, I can say I've had a lot of experience with the game. In that time, I've clocked 1.3k hours and have seen a lot of changes. It's funny really, when I consider the very beginning. For my very first MM rank, I successfully achieved Silver 1. That day I was so excited, only to find out it was the lowest rank there is. Yeah, that sort of sucked. That's not something that deterred me though, because back then, I found enjoyment out of the game and saw a lot of potential that made me want to fight to the top. 

So, what exactly happened which took that enjoyment away? During 2016, I continued to play competitive CS, that being through regular MM, Faceit or even some ESEA. The difference from 2015-2016, is that in 2016, I began to often take breaks. These 'breaks' often came as a result of several angry occasions where I was confronted by the issues surrounding CS. Those issues are mostly the obvious ones everyone knows about, such as the increasing amount of cheaters, lack of necessary updates, hit registration, community etc.

The issues are something I wish to look more deeply into. Alongside hit registration, there is the problem of accuracy as a whole. The fact that you can have an AWP positioned on a players head and somehow 'miss' the shot, yet a player can running headshot you with a pistol is just insane. Further speaking about cheaters, there is the fact nothing is done to truly stop them. The developers of the game are greedy and they know how cheaters can be of benefit to them. When the time comes for a cheater to finally get banned, they can just go pay to get the game once more on another account. Within an hour or so of being banned, they are straight back. That's not the only instance of them being greedy. Take the graffiti update as an example. Instead of focusing on the game breaking issues, they add paints. Now, this brought a lot a nostalgia. Of course though, the first paint you recieve is awful and you have to go purchase more in order to have something that looks good. The limited use feature that prevents you having a graffiti spray for more than 50 uses just further proves of how hungry they are for money. A last point I wish to mention, is that I cannot forget about the unbelievably toxic community. I do respect this one is difficult to control though. 

Even despite all these game problems, I always managed to return to CS:GO. The reasons for this, as follows, were boredom, the fact that I was not too bad of a player or after I watched a Pro/YouTuber perform really well. These factors gave me the naive idea that I could once again gain enjoyment out of the game. That idea was soon shattered every time, when I was reminded of the state of the game and how it hasn't improved on any of the given issues. Huge attention comes to the game through the eSports scene or the regular community, however nothing changes. 

In order to put an end to the cycle I got myself in of leaving and returning, I promised to quit CS:GO for good in order to enjoy other games and activities outside gaming. I certainly had a fun time in playing CS:GO, however the increasing issues, lack of attention towards issues and the fact the communities voice is not heard, has currently killed the game for me. Who knows where things will go in the future with this game? I hope things may look up. 

Side note - I find it very amusing that so many of the positive reviews are full of content that is negative about the game. 

TL;DR - Quit CS:GO because of cheaters, greedy developers, toxic community, accuracy issues, lack of motivation etc.

[h1][u]Small Update - 12/12/16[/u][/h1] 

In an attempt to avoid any comments calling me 'hypocritical', although I will still most likely receive them, I am adding this update. Just now, I have reinstalled CS, this now being a month down the line since having it uninstalled. Whilst I have got the game back again, this review is still relevant as my views about the game have not really changed. The simple reason for me getting this game once more, is the fact I have been requested by many to play. Through requests, I have made the choice to maybe play with some friends here and there if they need the extra player. Chances are my enjoyment on the game will still be low and I do not intend to play this game regularly.",FALSE
49,"CS:GO, I mean the game itself is very fun but there is a huge issue that makes the experience so terrible. Once you reach a decently high rank in matchmaking that is Legendary Eagle Master and above, 60% of the games you will proceed to play will be against cheaters. These cheaters use paid cheats of at least ($40USD) per month; and they bypass overwatch by closet cheating, which means they hide their cheats by trying to look legit. This allows them to bypass overwatch as they hide their cheats quite well and make their shots look as if it was all luck. I myself have been queued against cheaters 8 games in a row in LEM-GE matchmaking. Because of stuff like this I've started moving onto other games such as Overwatch (the game from Blizzard). I actually enjoy CS:GO more than Overwatch but the game is filled with cheaters in the higher matchmaking ranks that ruins the experience for people like myself. The situation is actually disgusting, where we now have people who queue with cheaters in order to gain a high rank, because at this point if you want to reach and maintain GE you either queue with cheaters or become one; at least in the Oceania scene of matchmaking. And I forgot to mention that this is in Prime matchmaking, which is supposed to be fairly safe. These cheaters also have groups where they admit to cheating, even inviting more people to join them and play matchmaking while they either boost them or cheat together. CS:GO as a game is great, but I really hope Valve puts a hold on adding new skins all the time and actually makes a decent anti-cheat which bans all those external software users. Many people suggest ESEA, but there are people like me who have no interest of going pro or playing at tournaments in the future, ESEA is for people who are serious and dedicated to the game; for those who are looking to be a step ahead. I'm just a normal player who enjoys the game, I'm not looking to go big in CS, so I do not see why someone like myself would need to pay to play a legit game of ranked CS:GO. What's funny is a third party matchmaking client has a better anti-cheat than a multi-millionaire company like Valve. The VAC waves of one cheat are not enough. There are many other cheats out there and new ones are made all the time. I really like this game but at this point I feel like quitting due to stuff like this. This is why for now I won't recommend this game; not unless Valve at least manages to actually fix this issue.",FALSE

However, now I'm at the top end of the game, you struggle to find a legit game where there isn't any cheaters. You have to go to third party websites which charge monthly to play without cheaters, and even then there is still the odd few. So if you're a casual gamer looking for a time wasting game this is for you, however if you're willing to invest thousands of hours into this game to try and reach the top I wouldn't recommend it until Valve sorts out their anti-cheat (Which will never happen).

You're better off hot railing meth than playing this godforsaken game.
For every moment of fun and accomplishment you get 5 moments of desperation in this addicting hell hole.

Now when it comes to skins. The marketing and hype for skins is absolutely incredible. Valve did a good job creating a platform, where having expensive items that do jack'all is considered that of a higher social status, somehow similar to buying expensive branded clothes. Of course a lot of people don't care about skins. But let me tell you. Once you start getting into the game more. You start seeing yourself improving as you go on. And you will absolutely spend money on skins rather than buying a new game or something different on steam. It's an ego trap. Everyone thinks they are on a road to becoming the best player, which gives them a justification for spending money on useless shit, and for the more mentaly unstable individuals... Gamble with those items, so that they get stuck in this loop of wanting to return to their base value by gambling more. Creating gambling addicts disguised as videogame players- What is even more damaging, is the fact that valve doesn't enforce the ratings of their games, even to the extent of microtransactions. Making teenagers without developed rational thinking fall down the rabbit hole on the same basis as non-consentable sexual conduct would have.

69,"I've played CS.GO for a thousand hours plus. I think, I've clocked in a decent number of hours to offer genuine and reliable thoughts/insights/feedback of the game. If there had to be reasons why i would not recommend this game, it would be for two reasons.

Firstly, I have to say that the CS.GO community is horrible. People show no signs of mercy to those who are new (Including myself at times). There are plenty of rude people. Of course i've met really nice people who respect one another but that is just a small minority. Too many people kicking out starters from casual matches for being noob ( not forgetting many times people kick out random players to allow friends to enter the match) and many times sore losers who constantly restart the match just because they died/didnt get a kill/for fun.

Secondly, the number of hackers and smurfs that are present now. These people are spoiling the game for those who enjoy some casual FPS and also in competitive mode. Especially for smurfs, I know of many who wish to rank up higher in competitive but simply cant due to the number of smurfs who are actively cockblocking them. And as for hackers, there are those who use it for personal glory or to use it to sell people ranking up services. These people are simply a real pain to the CS.GO community. Need I say more?

CS.GO, honestly, is good fun. I do love CS.GO. I have spent many good hours with friends, meeting new people and killing chickens. However the harsh reality of the CS.GO is simply cruel and merciless with people constantly yelling at you and telling you that you're no good, along with a good bunch of hackers/smurfs who ruins your gaming experience.

If you cant handle the harshness of the CS.GO community, dont start playing it. However if you choose to enter the CS.GO world alone, good luck. I hope you meet a few reliable and friendly comrades.

Until Valve finds a way to counter the problem is hackers and smurfs (especially in competitive mode), I will not recommend it. (Suggestion to counter smurfs: If the IP address has been in a CS.GO server before, he/she will not be allowed to play in the same pool of players in competitive mode.)

EDIT: Valve's implementation of having 24 hours cooldown after every 2 wins for fresh competitive accounts is a great effort in slowly down smurfs and catching hackers via overwatch, however i think a more full proof method would be required after once they reached 10 wins.

ADDITIONAL NOTE: To the few who have disagreed with my review because 'It's the community you're unhappy about, not the game', here's what i have to say. I strongly believe for a game like CS.GO (in fact any game with multiplayer funtionalities), community is a very large contributing factor if the game is good or not. It is the community that makes the game whole and who it is, especially for a game like CS.GO. I highly doubt people buy CS.GO to play offline mode/bot matches.

Though I understand your point of view, and that i should be reviewing the game base on its mechanisms/funtionalities like movement/gun bullet mechanics/matchmaking. However for my review, my aim is to offer my readers a deeper insight to the game than just what you see it on the surface/trailers.

At first you might feel that the community doesnt affect you at all, however once you get into the game, i believe you'll change your opinion. If you still disagree, I think its either you havent been exposed enough or you're just darn lucky meeting really nice and legitimate players in your matches.

71,"After playing the game for roughly 500 hours, I have come to a point that I should express my opinion about the game's current state.

Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is a highly competitive game that focuses on team wo--. Really? You REALLY think im going to describe this game as the perfect cut gem of an E-Sports title?.... well, you came to the wrong review comrade!

In essence, CS:GO in its current state has some things you really wouldn't want in a game of this type:

-Cheaters/VAC:
Most of them obviously have been cheating for a long time, but what does valve care? The only thing useful they do is milk their games for money until they are bone dry and deserted. I just can't get over that fact that valve hasn't actually ""noticed"" that their anti-cheat has flaws, but instead they keep releasing more useless items than bug fixing updates for the game itself.

-Griefers:
They are not really common nowadays, but back in the day every 5/10 - 6/10 competitive matches i went would have atleast 1 griefer that didn't do anything but insult,generally discriminate or just flat-out do absolutely nothing to help the team win a single round. These individuals are most commonly found on the lower ranks, from my experience.

-SMURFS:
I have seen more smurfs in cs:go matchmaking than in the actual cartoon itself.

Basically this ruins the game for new players by giving them the appearance that CS:GO just isn't worth playing if you don't know how.

-THE SALTENING BEGINS:
Do you want to experience more highly concentrated amounts of salt in one match than in a salt mine, followed by a community of 12 year olds more cancerous than the radiation levels at Chernobyl? Well my friend, CS:GO is the game for you! (Warranty for broken mice, keyboards, screens, headsets, desks, windows, and possibly hands from hitting your desk too hard not included.)

-Servers:
When I mean servers I don't intend to talk about the ping/lag, but instead about how most of the time I get matched against/with people from the other side of the damn galaxy. (This is good if you want to learn how everyone has had sexual intercourse with your family members/pets in diverse languages, while you simultaneously proceed to lose the match.)

TL;DR:
CS:GO is a game that gives everybody a different experience (Unless you are playing in russia, then it's always B rushed every round). Cringy jokes aside, I think this game is somewhat addicting and pleasant in the long run, despite the initial steep learning curve. If valve ever decides to ACTUALLY update their anti-cheat system I will be more than happy to play this game more often.

Again, kids. Kids spamming their mic with trash. When they are dead, they proceed to mic spam positions of the enemy team, but the thing is: kids are stupid and do not know that when you are dead. People will not be able to hear you, only the other dead players.

74,"I can both say yes and no to recommend this game.

Counter-Strike, can be good with friends but if you try to play a lot of random games to climb the ranks you will encounter the second most toxic gaming community ever. You get every kind of stereotype on here from the kid who slept with your mother to some guy calling everyone a b*tch N*gga. 

With well over 2000 hours I can not recommend CS:GO in its current condition. Why is that?

-Servers. The servers are horrible. 64 tick is not enough to play on. You will often encounter bullets that do no damage yet there is blood on the walls behind them. Their performance is lack luster and lots of servers are doing a stutter/stop as of lately or the registration is just... Non-existant.

-Hackers. They are still running rampant in CSGO. ""Prime"" accounts are still subject to them. It seems as if VAC is not working at all. You will encounter a LOT of them from Silver to MGE. (There are smurfs but you can tell them apart from hackers very easily. I enjoy playing smurfs as I see it as a chance to see what I need to work on to get better.)

-Toxic community. This game relies on three very major things. 1. Aim 2. Communication 3. Listening. There are very seldom times that you will come across a team that is willing to Communicate and Listen. From my experience (MGE or lower for the majority) A lot of people do not communicate because they are talking too much and when you ask them to hush for the rest of the game and to type, they throw hissy fits as if their mother just denied them a cookie. If you try to communicate with people and call stuff, and they blame you for their death becuase you're trying to communicate where the enemies are. ""One B"" - Teammate dies - ""OMG WHY DID YOU SAY HE WAS BE WHEN CLEARLY THEY ARE A!""  Everyone ALWAYS tries to blame others instead of understanding that it was just good timing on their end. 

-Gambling addictions with opening cases. Opening cases can be fun at times. However, the absolutely horrible prices for keys makes it a very expensive risk if you get a simple item that is only worth $0.02 on the CM. A lot of people waste their money here. 


NOW FOR THE GOOD

-Meeting awesome new people. I have met quite a few people on here. Some of the best people I have ever had the chance to encounter. It was awesome! We still enjoy kicking back and having a few beers. 

-Gaming Tournaments. TONS of LAN parties play CSGO or CS1.6 and it's an absolute amazing time. Everyone gets super serious but also come out of it with smiles, win or lose. 

-Hand + Eye coordination improvement. My hand and eye coordination used to be utterly horrible. However, MAAAAAAAANY years ago, when I first got CS1.5 my hand and eye coordination improved drastically over the time.

75,"I've made a career on this game and became a ""youtuber"" .. Therefore I made a lot of money, bought a beautiful house a sport car found love of my life and made a lot of friends... so what I can honesly say about this game is - That it is pure trash full of cheaters and noone should play it because Valve doesn't give a fuf so why should players do.",FALSE
76,"Let me preface this just a bit.

I love Counter-Strike. I've met so many cool people over the years I've played, had so many laughs and good times, it's been a blast. However, I'd say about 95% of that was purely through casual. 

So after 500+ hours in the game, I decided to try and get into the competitive scene. I got a few buddies together and we were gradually progressing through the silver ranks (I know call me bad, shit, etc.) and we were having good fun. We'd win 3, lose 1, but the point was that it was fun.

However, as we got higher and higher up, it stopped being fun. The reason? Absolutely piss poor matchmaking and security from Valve's end. I can understand one bad game or 2, but it got to the point where it was consitently terrible. At this point I had stopped queing with less than a full lobby. Me and a couple friends would get qued up with people with 900 ping who were basically worse than bots, they'd leave, and then its a 3v5 for the entire match. Experiences like this, are not fun, at all. 

The worst part though, is the amount of painfully obvious hackers in this game. VAC is the poorest fucking excuse for an anti-cheat system I've ever seen. One hacker will basically carry an entire team, and 9/10 times the enemy team won't have the integrity to kick the blatant hacker, because he'll carry them to the next rank. The most you can do is report them, but with how cheap this game is, it's no problem for people to make another account and rinse-repeat. 

Valve makes more than enough money on this game to justify having a better anti-cheat system. It is honestly one of the saddest examples of a company not giving a shit about their community that I can think of in the gaming industry. Say what you want about EA being a money hungry shitty company that hates their fans, I guarantee you that you won't run into as many hackers on official Dice Battlefield servers than you will an official CSGO server. That's just sad. 

Again, I love this game. If you want to play casual or community or what have you, you'll probably have a great time learning the quirks of the game, learning the maps, and engaging with the goofy ass community I've come to love/hate. However, the competitive scene is pure cancer. I do hope that Valve reads these, even though I highly doubt it, because I truly want what's best for this game.

-It's a huge e-sport

-very well done maps

-it has it's own weapons system that's very unique and adds an incredibly high learning curve.

-It keeps a classic arcade feel to the game so it's easy to pick up

The game has seen worse times, but even still, it's terribly flawed.

Cons:
-Unless you're playing in a LAN, where everyone is in the same room, you're going to have tons of hit registration problems.

-Valve's 64 tick servers are great for lower ranks from Silver to Master Guardian. But once you get past that, you've probably accumulated some skill and an understanding of the game and how it works. Quite often, while playing a competitive matchmaking, you'll shoot at someones head, see blood, and absolutely nothing will happen in your favor. 
128 tick servers exist, but you need to go to a third party to use them, which seems pretty excessive just to play the game with a few less problems.

-The community is the most toxic, vile, absurd- you know what. Just get a dictionary and every single word that has a negative connotation will pretty much describe the community that plays this game. 

-Hackers EVERYWHERE. Hackers are insanely abundant and carry on without a care in the world. They don't worry about getting banned because they have no problem buying the game again, especially if it goes on sale, and just hacking all over again. This is probably the biggest reason Valve doesn't do anything to REALLY try and put a stop to it. But why would they? It makes them money when someone finally does it get banned so who cares about the legit players who try to enjoy the game for what it is, right?

-There are a certain number of bugs and exploits that are in the game, that haven't ever really been addressed. For example, a persistant sound bug that sounds like someone is running when in fact nobody is there. (I believe they have fixed the running audio glitch but there are many more issues yet to be addressed.)

-The developers put out updates, and just when you think it's something useful, like fixing a bug or exploit that's been making the game unfair, they just add more sounds! Or adjust sound levels! Pretty much nothing that matters to serious players. 

Conclusion:
The game at its core is a decent game. But you can't play it the way it's 'meant' to be played with just the game itself. For actually decent servers, and a SLIGHTLY more tolerable community, you need to sign up with a third party website that hosts their own servers so you can play the game. But those matches don't count for anything in the game itself, it's pretty much just a platfom to work around. 

If you're going to get the game just for a time killer and don't plan to take it serious then great. But otherwise, don't waste your money or your time.

I manage(d) four community competetive servers that are fairly popular, and I used to have a blast playing on them. But now whenever I go into the servers, it usually ends in me having to ban the ENTIRE lobby. I've quite literally yelled about how tired I was of babysitting because that's exactly what I had to do. I'm very accustomed to seeing hackers and cheaters from monitoring so many for so long with my time on the servers so when I play matchmaking matches the hacks are very easy to spot out. 'Professional' players have been banned for hacking before for crying out loud.

The first few hundred hours of my gameplay were pretty fun. The learning curve made it challenging and different and that's what I enjoyed. But the higher rank you get and the more serious you play, the more terrible everything becomes. I've made it to Supreme Master First Class, (Rank before Global Elite, highest rank in the game's ranking system.) and I can't say that I want to bother trying to get Global or playing anymore in general. At this point, every other match has a hacker or at the very least a griefer or extremely toxic person that wants to spoil your day. Whether a hacker is blatant or not, it becomes pretty apparent when someone's playing unfairly. 

All in all, there's no sportmanship or respect in a game that would do extremely well with both of those things, and the lack of feedback from developers in helping clean up the community or create better servers is very unsettling, especially for one of the most popular games on Steam.

86,"Well, I have been playing CS for the last 10 years, over 10,000 hours on 3 accounts (3000 hours in cs go). I had a lot of fun, but with the release of the glove update, I understood, that CS GO community and Valve no longer care about the players, and are just in there for the money. 

In every game there is a 90% chance that you will either get a cheater or a smurf, and what does Valve and CS GO community do about it?? they release new cases. 

Before this game used to be fun, and after a hard day, I would come and enjoy a few rounds with my friends, but now instead of fun I get stressed with all the cheaters. It is really sad to watch a downfall of such a gaming giant as CS, but this is was greed does to the best of us.  


I DO NOT RECOMMEND TO PLAY THIS GAME",FALSE
87,"I would not recommend this game for those in the community who do not have company to play with. With that said, lets jump into the review. 

(Comments are on as I would like to highlight the toxic potential of the community. Many are correct to disagree with my opinions based on their experiences and express those opinions appropriately, but others will seek to be vile on purpose, and these are the people I warn you of. Also check my profile comments because some children are too ashamed to comment on here and instead hide it on there. Lol!)

Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is one of the only games that I can say has cultivated a community attitude of toxicity and hate as the NORMAL accepted attitude. I do not speak for all players I encounter, as there are many great users out there, but this game has done something terribly wrong. I have accumulated a total of 4000 hours in this game across numerous accounts, played from near the highest ranks to the lowest (Legendary Eagle Master - Silver two), and played with high and low trust factor (A built in game-measure to try and match you with players who are positively and negatively affecting the community) 

This review is to highlight what is expect game-to-game in a CO-OPERATIVE and TEAMWORK driven game for the average player, from my experiences and those of my friends and fellow strangers who share similar opinions. I will touch on different parts of the games failure to provide a positive and encouraging base for players to engage with the game-modes provided.

TRUST-FACTOR: Trust factor is essentially the games way of matching you with similarly minded individuals by including factors such as: Amount of reports received; Temporary cool-downs; Commendations; 
Reality: Trust factor is EXTREMELY ineffective at segregating those who wish to be verbally abusive, to the extreme of your default trust factor of a new account being unbearably vile. E.x: I had a new account and within the first four games, I had been kicked by two groups of ""4-queued"" friends for their amusement, encountered one aim-assisted user blatantly killing, and only one game having friendly users who also complained about the same repetitive toxicity. So at the base level, using hacks (program assistance to enhance personal game-play), intentional losing of games, verbal abuse, and harassment is the default level of the community. 

OVERWATCH: Overwatch is a built in review system that users have access to after reaching the rank of Gold Nova in the competitive game-mode, giving them the option to review users games who have received multiple reports within a VERY short time. From my understanding and what I have heard, a user must be reported upwards of 10 TIMES in a single day for exploits. Problem is there are 9 other people in a given match the hacking individual is in. This means that if they are playing with friends, it would take NUMEROUS games for the individual to even make it to this preliminary review process. This means if all people do not report, it is a free pass to hack once to twice a day and have no repercussions. The conviction rate of hacking users in Overwatch is minimal. Here is a link to a Q&A about Overwatch, and with a skim over you should be able to see flaws in many places.  https://blog.counter-strike.net/index.php/overwatch/ 

RANK SYSTEM: The point of a rank system is to separate people by average skill level and consistency of game-play. CS:GO is the WORST example of this. Disappointing is an understatement, with no regulation of users making new accounts to play in lower ranks, and the anti-cheat program being a joke of a program, any rank is any rank, and if you want to climb to higher ranks, best of luck. Silver, the lowest rank, is the most toxic, alternate account using, and hacking users makes it EXTREMELY hard and aggravating to achieve a sense of accomplishment within the progressive rank system. Gold Nova gets a little better, with users usually having climbed past the majority of idiotic venom of silver, and finding more like minded people. Master Guardian is the IDEAL rank to relax, and find the most common ground. Users often have played seriously for some time, and have been through the rough of the community. That being said, often people are very serious and wont tolerate room for ""fun"". Above this rank, Legendary Eagle and up, its a serious game for serious gamers. The good and bad comes with the territory of being more elite, attitudes and all.

Game-modes: 
DEATHMATCH: Good for chilling with music, the community can be toxic but I usually find matches quiet at times and enjoyable. Type Voice_enable 0 into console, this is a great command (this disables voice communications if you do not want random music, people yelling, racism, or toxicity for meaningless things)

Arms-Race: A typical gun-progression based game-mode, similar to death-match, just different game-play.

Hostage: Rescue a hostage and deliver them to the delivery zone while fighting off defending terrorists. No idea what the community is like because I avoid this game-mode completely! (If I had to guess, not too pleasant, but if it is message me NOW)

That covers just about all I want to about your expected experience of this teamwork and co-operative based game. Now a few comments about the GAME:

PROS:
-difficult and rewarding gun-play that improves with practice and invested time
-great game loop and feel of round-to-round game-play
-depthful skill-development 
-can always improve and grow stronger as a player
-dynamic maps with fairly balanced designs

CONS:
-limited selection of guns(although hard to master what their is)
-Few maps per gamemode, or reused
-terrible community
-often useless and few patches and updates
-old game engine vulnerable to exploits 
-pretty terrible graphics considering modern titles comparable to CS:GO
-non-optimized programming and map rendering leads to FPS drop and poor performance
-Low-quality and poor running servers at times

You've made it easier for cheaters to access Prime matches; a paywall didn't stop them from buying the game before so why would a cheaper paywall to play Prime stop them now. 

Oh and by the way, never make a paid game free to play if it still has a huge active community. All of those people didn't buy and support your game for you to make it free when players become less interested in it, it's just a huge slap in the face.

Today i dropped From Global Elite to supreme and lost 3 games on SMFC against Rage Hacking kids. In one game we were 8:4 ahead and 1 opponent left, joined back 3 rounds later jsut to announce he quickly downloaded a hack. So after he ragecarried the remaining rounds getting 11 MVPs we obviously lost. 

Don't get me wrong there are some strong players in this game who hit insane shots but with my almost 6 k hours of Counterstrike experience i can tell you that at least 5/7 matches have one hacker +, not even counting the insane amount of players using some kind of radar hack. 

In fact Valve doesn't even care. Do they try getting rid of the Hacker Problem? No, not really. Instead they keep adding skins and cases you have to pay for. 
Overwatch function seemed nice in the early state, but watching an overwatch session, you can't hear the ingame voice chat, which pretty much makes it useless. How do you want to hear if some1 keeps playing music ingame, uses a microphone of 1937 or keeps flaming? Or a hacker calling ingame? No, all you can see is a Scoreboard and the PoV of the Suspect, of course  you are not able to switch the teammates. 

Counterstrike Anti-Cheat is so damn useless, a friend with 1 year programming experience was able to build a hack, which was undetected for over 2 years.

Another problem ist the community. Most players below LEM  are queueing with 2+ mates only speaking their own explicit language. So why the hell is there no ""Team-Language"" Option ingame to fix these kind of things?

All in all CS-GO is a  nice skill-based shooter with high potential, being ruined by a company only interested in milking the cow and a highly toxic community. To enjoy this game you would actually need to buy ESEA or just not play any kind of competative matches, which would make cs go kind of senseless.

Matchmaking and competitive play has become a pain in the ass, where you have to hope for at least semi-decent teammates in order to have the slightest chance of winning a match. The ranking system makes no sense, where a person carrying and placing at the top of the scoreboard is punished and deranked because his team lacks skills and communicational efforts.

109,"I've held this view of CSGO for quite some time, but have never found the time or motivation to publish my thoughts. I've been playing CS for many, many years - starting in the early 2000's through to present day. This time has seen me enjoy the game as a causual scrubber camping hostages, enjoying leveling my character in WC3 mods, smashing heads in deathmatch, surfing backwards, long-jumping, bhopping, played in quals for WCG, competed in CEVO and flew to different locations to compete competitively with my team in different tournaments. I've enjoyed CS from 1.1 to 1.6, CZ, CSS and also CSGO. No, this does not make me a better player than you, and no this does not mean I know everything, it simply means that I have spent a lot of time playing different titles of Counter-Strike, have played competitively and have experienced the good and the bad aspects of different releases.
There are a handful of things that really upset me with CSGO, and they upset me more so because these issues still exist two years after I have first played the game. These issues I consider to be game-breaking bugs that make it such a waste of time to play. I enjoy CS because there is a skill curve: if you want to be the best at the game, you simply need to practice and spend more time learning the mechanics of the game than your opponent - This was certainly true in all other CS games I have played, but not CSGO. CSGO feels like it is a game of luck and chance.
As the game stands, it is fun to play casually but anything competitively or MM is hampered by issues surrounding core aspects of the game.
Hitboxes are not lag-compensated to follow the model of a player when jumping
Hitboxes are not lag-compensated to follow the model of a player when crouching
Hitboxes do not follow the animation of a player planting the bomb
Aimpunch phyiscally affects recoil and is not lag-compensated
If you are on > 70ms ping in a 64tick Server, this is how most events will play out:
You see an enemy jump, you shoot the enemy and get no hits.
You see an enemy continuing to jump peak a spot, you have to time your shoots to shoot where his head is going to be on the next cycle. You shoot thin air, blood appears and you get a headshot kill
You see an enemy standing there, you shoot his chest, you get no hit and then he crouches instantly.
You see an enemy standing there, you shoot his abdomen and get a headshot (because he was crouching on the server)
You see an enemy, shoot first, die and get no hits. Watch the demo back and apparently how it played out was that he shot you first and your player aimpunched and the bullet actually hit the roof.
You are hiding in a bombsite and see an enemy planting the bomb. You crouch and take your time and shoot his head 12 times, slowly one by one. You get no hits and die.
All of these aspects of the game I consider EXTREMELY game-breaking. The fact that most people reading this will stop and think to themselves, ""Yeah, that has happened to me on a number of occasions"" just goes to show that the game is fundamentally flawed. In it's current state, the game rewards people for NOT AIMING - aka, ""good"" players in the game need only aim at the ground, run and shoot and they'll likely get a headshot, because as long as you don't aim AT the model that you see, there is a high likelihood that the server will decide you should have got a hit. The only one of these bugs that existed in Counter-Strike Source (pre-2010 OB update) was the hitboxes on the planting animation.
An example of a bug that I do not consider game-breaking, but extremely frustrating, is the spectator glitch where you are not able to spec another player. For some reason, after the last update this bug was introduced and it has now been 3 weeks and there is still no patch or fix for this? A feature so important to the game such as being able to spectate your team has been inadvertently broken, and after 3 weeks there has still been no patch? That is a huge disappointment.
People standing outside a smoke will be full view to others with no smoke obscuring them, but the player's screen will be completely black. This was an unintentional meta-change when trying to fix one-way smokes, and this new issue has existed for months now? The game has been changed so much due to this introduction such that people holding a site need only throw a smoke at the choke and will get an infinite advantage as anyone pushing through will have seconds delay before they are ever able to see the people that can see them. Throw a smoke down, wait until it starts to fade, teammate resmokes - rinse, repeat and run down the timer. Retaking a site with anything other than a horrid oponent who can't capitalise on the blind-criple wandering through the smoke is now completely impossible. What a horrible meta change. Why has this not been addressed this was introduced some months ago?
3D sound is non-existent in CSGO. It is not possible to tell whether someone is running above or below you, and more often than not difficult to determine whether someone is approaching from the front or behind.
This game has so many core issues wrong with it that completely changes the outcome of the game that it is not funny. I find it extraordinary that so many people are able to accept this game with all these issues, and there are few posts on this reddit about these problems. I see many threads upvoted to the top of terrorists hugging each other, but hardly any threads of people discussing the pressing issues which desperately requires patching to make the game both playable and enjoyable.

117,"[quote][b]NOTE:[/b] There will be mistakes in my english below, sorry for that but I'll try my best to describe my experience while I was playing this game. 
This is a serious review and I'm not trying to joke around, I'll include as many details as I can to help you understand that this game is not worth your time and health.[/quote]

[h1]Introduction:[/h1]
Counter-Strike: Global Offensive or CS:GO is a 5v5 Competitive fps game, the gameplay is classic and not that realistic, graphics are decent but no one care about them since all players aim for higher frame rates by lowering resolution & graphics settings to take the best advantages over the other players.

It took me 600+ hours to convince myself that this game is killing my mental health and it's not worth my time at all, sure I had a lot of fun sometimes (I mean who doesn't know the feeling when you are getting most of the kills and your friends shout with your name everytime you clutch an impossible round) but the negatives were more than the positives.

[quote]I'll talk below about the game in general and later I'll include the reasons of why you should stay away from this game so If you are only interested in the reasons skip to ""Why you shouldn't play this game?"" section.[/quote]

[h1]Gameplay:[/h1]
[quote][b]NOTE:[/b] I'll only talk about the competitive side of the game because it's the most played playlist and the reason why you shouldn't buy this game.[/quote]
There are two teams, Counter-Terrorists and Terrorists, CTs play the defenders role and Ts play the attackers role in Bomb Maps (roles are switched in Hostage Maps).

The match can reach 30 rounds (15-15) which is a tie, and if one of the teams win 16 rounds they win the match, CTs win the round when they kill all the Ts, defuse the bomb (or rescue a hostage) and when Ts run out of time before planting the bomb. Ts win the round when they kill all the CTs, when the bomb explode or when CTs run out of time (Hostage Maps).

The game is based on an economy system, I'll not go in details in that section because I have more important things to focus on, but each team start the round with pistols, and 800$ to spend, you have to buy guns and gear every round (if you die), you can also collect others weapons and drop weapons to your teammates If they don't have money to buy, eco system can be a factor of winning and losing so you have to know when to buy and when to save.

Each gun in this game has a spray pattern, so don't run'shot like you are playing call of duty, don't expect your bullets to go where you are putting your crosshair, you have to learn how to control your weapons.

[quote]CS:GO relies on communication, skills, map knowledge, It's not for everyone, if you want to get good at it you need to invest a lot of time training, If you solo queue and you match up with a team that doesn't communicate or give infos expect high chances of losing the match so don't go into this game without a pre-made lobby with people you actually know and trust to guarantee communication, you also need to know the map by playing in it a lot and learn its tricks, map knowledge help you too in winning.[/quote]

[h1]Prime And Non-Prime:[/h1]
If you are planning to play this game no matter what I say in this review do me a favor and just buy it, Non-Prime is unplayable, there are a lot of cheaters and VAC just doesn't work, also there is no ranked feature for free users, the game used to give them access to Prime after reaching level 21 but laws has changed and there is no point from Free to Play Competitive game without a goal (Rank to achieve). 

[b]NOTE:[/b] Prime doesn't mean you will not meet with any cheater, no it just decreases the chances of meeting with one.

[h1]Why you shouldn't play this game?[/h1]
[quote]NOTE: My whole experience is mostly based on ranked solo queue in EU servers so If you got a 4 men team to play with, you really not gonna experience most of the following reasons, but I still highly don't recommend this game to anybody.[/quote]
✔️ [b]Toxicity and Kids[/b], I'm not racist or anything but most of the russians I played with are either toxic players and non-english talkers that play the game to pass time and doesn't care about throwing the match or 10yo kids that bought the game with their parents money and doesn't even know how to play the game properly (I'm not joking that's the truth), Russians are a popular nightmare for all EU, everyone expect to lose the match when they find out that there is a russian in the team, its not russians issue only I met non-russians toxic players too, what I'm trying to say is that CS is a popular game in russia and most of the players you will get in your queue are russians that doesn't give info in english nor play good nor try to win. It would be better if valve made a separate server for them.

✔️ [b]Hackers[/b], Valve Anti-Cheat doesn't work, played against a lot of cheaters before months with evidences like literal spinbot on spawn, I'm still checking their profiles until now and they still didn't get banned, VAC is so bad and valve doesn't care about that the best thing they did to make it better is blocking 3rd party programs overlays like discord and screen recorders.

✔️ [b]Matchmaking System[/b], the matchmaking system is terrible, expect most of the time to be matched with a 4 premade trollers that keep laughing in discord and doesn't care about telling you info in game and throw the game or votekick you at the last round, you will also sometimes match with boosted players who has fake ranks that they got by the help of their friends so they will not do well against the enemy team as a result you will lose, also sometimes you will be matched against smurfs who has been playing the game since the beta release.

[h1]Overall Experience:[/h1]
I rarely played a fair match in this game, sure I feel happy sometimes playing it with a friend or two I mean everyone likes the feeling when all your dead friends are spectating you and you clutch a round, it feels good but most of the time I just hurt my mental health when I touch this game, It's not about losing or winning but about the people you play with and the people you play against. CS:GO is just not the perfect game to balance that.

thanks a lot for ruining CS:GO making it free to play, which was the absolute wrong thing.
Tons of hackers in casual games and official matchmaking on all skill levels, VAC not working at all, people playing with 2$ hacks undetected for years! This is purely unplayable and just a massive pain in the arse.

124,"A solid game. Very good shooter mechanics, Very little support from valve. All valve cares about is ""D O T A 2"". Only if valve focused on it's anti-cheat. The community is pretty toxic in CSGO.  I still remember getting kicked from the game for being ""noob"" when i was new at the game. And getting cheaters in opponent. This really leaves a bad taste to the mouth of new players and casual players, since they just wanna have a good game. Many people will say ""Go to ESEA or Faceit"" But 60% of the playerbase doesn't even know what they do. So it's not really a solution to cheaters. People like me just wanna get back from school/work and have a fun game or two with friends. Hackers just ruin the game. And the worst thing is, People don't even kick them. They ""wanna"" get boosted by hackers but don't understand that getting boosted will do them nothing good, let alone by a cheater since if the cheater gets banned (they get banned only 50% of the time) they will lose their boosted wins thus deranking. And cheaters, OMG where do I start, VALVE! Please F I X  your  broken game !  there are literally threads on the CSGO reddit spoonfeeding and showing how to fix certain things. V A L V E   still wont fix it. The fact that there is even an hvh community itself puts valve to shame.

127,"CSGO is a competitive based Team Shooter. Its one of the most popular games on steam,and i dont think I have to explain the gameplay so lets jump straight to the pros and cons.

Pros:
-Many Gamemodes some for the more Casual Minded and others for the hardcore players
-Many tutorials online to get started as a newcomer
-Timeless gameplay that is fun escpecially if you play it with some friends
-Big amount of Community Server if the standard game modes arent something you want
-Runs on a toaster


Cons
-Many People you meet (NOT everybody but most of the time) are pretty toxic
-Can get frustrating 
-Valve Anti Cheat is well...not really working. It can happen from time to time that you get some hackers in Matches.
-Smurfs/DeRanker and Griefer will destroy the experience often
-Updates that debalance the game 
-Valve is jut intereseted in selling skins and Cases


As a conclusion if you are a hardcore competitive gamer who doesnt fear a steep learning curve or toxic teammates,and you can ignore the hacker/smurfer/griefer every second game. Then try it out. For everybody else it isnt worth trying. Dont waste your time and money with this game. And try something else! :)

I wish there was an option to choose who to play with but again that wouldn't help because russians are everywhere. It saddnes me because i fed up with screaming kids and chavos and im quitting CSGO because of it. I can't enjoy the game while i have to listen to angry rednecks on the mic or screaming kids for 40-60 minutes.

144,"Heads up, I will still be playing this game since the game itself is very good and addicting, just read the thumbs down.

Counter-Strike has made it's way to one or maybe the best first person competitive shooter, every gun has to be mastered atleast decently to win the gun fights between you and the enemy. A very fun and challenging shooter with it's own unique mechanics and matchmaking system.

Anyone that's interested in tactical shooters will most likely buy the game, expecting a whole new experience between strategy and skill.

This is where most players quit.

The expectation of the looks and mechanics are the same as they have seen in either a video or stream. A youtuber who enjoys a match of solo queue.

What they get:

- Higher skilled players with new accounts ruining low ranks
- Cheaters
- A Toxic community
- Trolls

Every game I have played was there was 70% smurfs and the rest trolls and cheaters. Doing all the wrong and screwing over the matchmaking system where it becomes unfair for newer people that still have to learn, as for the toxic community flaming and blaming the new ones for trying to learn the game. (votekicking)

Ofcourse there are alternatives matchmaking clients but new people do a little bit know that their skill won't fit for that.

I recommend you to queue with 4 friends and that you play regularly with them, that is the best way to learn and not be screwed over by a team griefer.

So do I recommend the game itself?
Yes, I love how you have to use both of your brain and skill to win the game.

Do I recommend the game to new people reading this?

If you want to buy it, then buy it, thats up to you since it's your money.
The reason I won't recommend it is that it will be very hard to learn and enjoy the game. Ofcourse not everyone is a scumbag, it's just that the game won't be fun as you tought it was by these people and I don't want you to waste your time and money.",FALSE

First of all, competitive matchmaking is going to be hell if you are a new player. You will not be able to take part in prime matchmaking and will therefore be forced to grind out the game until you reach rank level 21 (the level required to get prime). This won't be fun however as you will encounter either a hacker or a smurf in every other game as you climb your way up to level 21. This will not only ruin the game for you but will also annoy/frustrate the rest of the players on your team leading to an increase in toxicity down coms. Furthermore, I feel as if Valve no longer cares about CS:GO and treats it more like a money making machine than a video game. I came to this conclusion as Valve seems to be constantly releasing new cases (a form of gambling for kids) instead of releasing updates to fix the prominent issues which loyal players face on a day-to-day basis such as the terrible anti-cheat, the tickrate, the hitboxes, the shot registration and the list goes on....

Comment: 

'Cant unsee the dogshit review. Came to get a sticker pack but had to respond. Valve is working on a new anti cheat and majority of good anti cheats have access to all files in your computer, which is essentially spying. Do you really think a massive company like Valve will utilise such techniques to ban a few cheaters? And even then, the best of the best are undetectable everywhere, even on ESEA. Cheats is a serious big industry. Why don't you apply to Valve and make them a better anti cheat that will surely ban everyone. You talk about the level requirement for prime for new players. A new player should not queue for competitive before even reaching level 21. These scrubs don't have any idea how to play the game and end up dropping the bomb or killing their teammates. The hitboxes aren't even that bad, people in games like overwatch seem to not care at all, where the hitboxes are much much worse. Hit reg isn't bad either. You're just looking for excuses to hate on CS.'

My Response: 

1) 'Valve is working on a new anti cheat': show me where you found/got this information

2) 'Cheats is a serious big industry': I agree that counter-strike will never be completely free of hackers but the anti-cheat is honestly terrible and it is ridiculous at how many people get away with hacking when they are so blatant. An example that I can give is the overwatch system which leads to a game ban if the player/account is convicted from the demo. For someone to be an overwatch candidate (The Suspect), their account has to receive 11 reports in one day. This basically means that people are able to blatantly 'rage hack' in two games each day if they are playing in a 5 man as they do not fall into the overwatch pool. This is a terrible system and valve already knows as it has been pointed out to them so many times in the past and yet they have still done nothing about it.

3) 'And even then, the best of the best are undetectable everywhere, even on ESEA': I know this already but you are talking about the 'best of the best' which most people won't and don't have access to. I have been playing ESEA for a while now and my point remains valid. I have only ever encountered 3 cheaters on ESEA which I reported immediately and as expected all 3 of them were banned in the following days. (THIS IS FROM PERSONAL EXPERIENCE)

4) 'A new player should not queue for competitive before even reaching level 21': What sort of point is that? I'm pretty sure you queued a game of comp before reaching 100 hours in-game? xD. Furthermore, there is a competitive rank that is catered towards new players, its called silver....

5) 'hitboxes aren't even that bad, people in games like overwatch seem to not care at all, where the hitboxes are much much worse. Hit reg isn't bad either.' I also play overwatch and I agree that people don't really give a shit about the hit reg, but overwatch is not CS:GO and CS:GO is not overwatch. In overwatch the terrible hitboxes have much less of an impact on winning/losing the game than in CS:GO where one shot could determine the outcome of a round which in turn could determine the outcome of the entire game. An example of this is allu's shot on short (dust 2) which missed when it should have hit and ended up with NiP losing the game. Furthermore, if you want more examples of the same thing, take a look at the thousands of videos on youtube which demonstrate how terrible the hitboxes/hitreg is (A huge part to do with all this is the 64 tick servers). 

 6) 'You're just looking for excuses to hate on CS.' That is not true at all, this following quote was taken straight out of my review: 'I would like to say that I love all of the counter-strike games (CS:GO, CSS and CS 1.6) as they have all been a huge part of my childhood'. I am not looking for excuses to hate on CS as I love the game but am instead picking out and addressing the issues which I face whenever I play the game.

EDIT 2: They recently updated the ranking system. It took 4 ranks away from me, and ever since the games are completely one sided all the time, either win by 7+ rounds or lose by 7+ rounds. One game had me and a few other gold nova 2s, some silvers, some no ranks, and 2 global elites on the other team. Nothing about competitive matchmaking makes any sense anymore.

the game itself is the best fps i have ever played. HOWEVER, it has always had a big problem with cheaters and smurfs, Every time it went on sale it would fill with cheaters, and the anti cheat doesnt do anything at all. the overwatch system seems to be ineffective too. You can unlock ""prime"" which is supposed to help, but all you have to do is reach lvl21 to get it.

Now the game is free to play its basically unplayable.You end up a handful of ranks below your skill due to getting battered by cheaters and smurfs almost every game, so when u play people your rank, you win by miles and they think you cheat. Its just no fun for anyone, ever, except cheaters. 

I love the game and have like 1500 hours or something, but its just pointless now its free to play and u still get prime at rank 21. Until they get a much better anti cheat or make it so that prime is paid only and costs a decent amount that it puts people off, there is no point in even playing this game for free. make prime £25+ so cheats just play for free and wont buy prime over and over and it might be worth it. but it doesnt take long to get to rank 21 with cheats, so for now just dont waste your time on this terribly managed game.",FALSE

167,"I used to recommend this game but I can't anymore. CS:GO is broken in a number of important ways right now: 

Pistols desperately need balance. 
Netcode and servers are horrible.
VAC essentially only catches the dumbest hackers. 
Overwatch more or less an admission that VAC doesn't work well but is also useless. 
Movement speed and run-and-gun gameplay style completely at odds with theme of tactical shooter. 
Tapping often offers little reward for risk in current spray meta (exception being AK at distance).
Jumping accuracy? ... Really? Why encourage jumping in a tactical shooter? SWEET REPLAYS!!!
R8 revolver... feels like an April fool's joke that never ended and now is just sort of a troll gun.
Non-Prime matchmaking a huge deterrent to new players - testing ground for hackers now. 
Prime matchmaking seems like an awkward fix to broken VAC and honestly still plenty of walls/etc.
Smokes still frequently glitch allowing players on one side to see through them.

I won't list toxic community as a negative of the game because there's nothing the developer can do about that. For all of you who want to cite Riot Games' efforts to improve player behaviour ask yourself this one question: have their efforts worked? No. League of Legends has the most toxic player environment I've experienced even compared to CS:GO or Dota2. Competitive games bring out the worst in a lot of people. That's a people problem not a developer problem. 

Anyway, in its current form I would not say that spending the considerable time to become skilled at this game is worth it as you will constantly be let down by wonky mechanics, bad servers, and the inescapable reality that there is a constant ebb and flow of hackers in competitive that make any sense of true competition feel absent. 

All in all, CSGO will have you asking yourself: am I having fun or is this actually adding negativity and stress to my life? The answer will vary from game to game but in the long run I think most people play this game out of habit rather than having a consistently positive experience.

Let me elaborate on this one: the game itself is fun. But given that this is an online game, the fun gets taken away by other players.

Pair that with the salty teammates you get during competetive games, who get angry at you for not winning certain situations they wouldn't have won either.

Im not sure when Trolls, Smurfs, and Hacks began to become the norm, but the game is broken.
They put it on sale for 5.00. Kids buy it just to hack it. Valve knows, they dont care. And all we do is BUY BUY BUY
skins. I mean 400.00 for a knife skin? WTF?!??!!? Didnt we used to be able to get those for free?  The guys hacking have a customer service number to call if they cant set it up correctly. Hacking is Big Business. They took 12 name tags from me, all because of 1 off-color gun name. Meanwhile, vulgarity far worse than my gun name, is allowed to cheat, troll, and make the game unplayable. Because its funny to watch people get pissed. And valve does nothing but put the game on sale. And kids, Rememer. When you tell ghame developers that your ok with paying 65.00 + 35 or 50 for the ""season pass"".  You set what the market will bear. Thus making games MORE expensive for us, and limiting how much fun you can really have with it. Cuz if you cant afford the season pass.. you dont get all that content. 
CSGO is setting an example of how to take all of your customers money, and make them happy they did it.
Maybe they put it on sale so that you can afford to have 3 copies of they game. 1 for rank, 1 for smurfing, and 1 for hacking...

[*]Doubt in your aiming skills (stay calm, this is not your fault, the hitbox and recoil is a joke)

[*]Tears of pure sadness, because the hope of HL2, Portal 3, L4D3 and an enjoyable CS lost, because the Valve swims in the money of the clever people who always buys 100 new cases, just to gamble it away (and here is other ""wonders"" like Dota 2 and Artifact)

The best thing Valve thought they did was add the ""CS:GO Fair Play Guidelines,"" expecting people to obey them when in reality they're just making themselves a meme as usual as it's another broken thing just like the anti-cheat and can literally be abused by people simply reporting you for griefing, which causes competitive cooldowns without any sort of review by a Valve member which makes innocent people get cooldowns although they haven't done anything wrong or grief but don't be surprised thats nothing new just Valve being retarded.

194,"The review you are about to read is alot of mixed feelings.. Notice i have 3k+ hours.. I have been playing Counter-Strike since 1.5 with some breaks in between focusing on school or relationships and while i have played plenty of other big titles growing up such as the Grand Theft Auto series or the Battlefield series i have always come back to the one game that i know and love. If you are really into shooters and have tried this game than you too will probably agree that CS has the most consistent replayability factor and is arguably the simplest yet most skillful shooter out there. Unlike games like Call Of Duty or Battlefield there is little to no debris covering your screen or random hiding spots that people camp behind at all times. Yes it happens but to be good in Counter-Strike Global Offensive you must capitalize on rushes and support your teammates in completing the objective. This is the ULTIMATE teamplay game and has just recently had an incredible boost in professional cs go tournaments concerning prize money and the viewers watching them. I stayed up all night til 7am to watch either Dreamhack or ESL (forget which one) That one match alone had about 300,000 viewers.. whereas CS Source was barely keeping their head above water with Professional tournys and teams in their day. So whats the problem?? The up until just recently awesome people over at Valve have become so focused on aqcuiring new players and revenue reguarding things like skins, cases, keys, taxes on items we sell on the marketplace, passes for new maps with objectives and even new copies of the game. Somewhere along the way i feel as if they have given up on the integrity of the game because it seems like every few months they put the game on sale for 5 bucks or so even though it is already insanely cheap only $15. I dont think you will find a single player in CS that will tell you they have played another game that is better or even EQUAL to CS and its replayability for $15.. That being said over time of course people will accuse other people of hacking i.e. wallhacking/aimbotting so if the game goes on sale for 4.99 even if a percentage of the people accusing others of hacking buy the game cheap just to have an alt account to get revenge and also hack thats a problem.. Now you think about Valve putting the game on sale a couple times a year and of course there will be MANY people that buy 5 or even more copies of the game! ..Just to hack and boost their friends.. This is becoming more of a problem for legit players like me. I literally feel like a superhero in a world full of villians. I am quickly seeing the decline of great real fun real skilled matches in CSGO. Everytime i join a competitive match there will from now on ALWAYS be a new account on the other team.. What is their excuse? ""Oh im just smurfing.."" You can even tell there are many more people hacking in overwatch these days. (overwatch is a self review cs go system of random people to determine if they were hacking or not) 6-12 months ago you would find overview cases kind of a challenge to decide on and most of the time would have some pretty nice skins. Nowadays 9/10 Overwatch cases they have absolutely no skins on their account or .20 cent skins to make it look like they do have skins and they couldnt POSSIBLY be hacking. Hackers do this because they KNOW there is a very high chance of them getting banned and losing these skins forever. Valve states that anyone Vac-Banned will NOT be able to get it overturned for any reason whatsoever. So tell me why during one of the major CS GO tournaments that just passed Pasha from the pro team Virtus Pro he was being filmed in real life over his shoulder and got vac banned in the middle of his match. simply said no i am not hacking and got his account UNBANNED. If he was at a lan tourny with everyone watching then he couldnt have been hacking right?? Wrong. It is going around that there is an undectable and unseen hack that is built into the map from the workshop(not exactly certain on the details) even when you are watching his screen in real life you would not notice.. Even worse than that every time valve does a wave of vac bans which is not nearly often enough there comes another undetectable hack that people find almost right away. The major point i am trying to make on this subject is that Valve makes MILLIONS on us for each skin, key, case, tax on the items we sell in game, operation pass and copy of the game we buy. and they still have a mediocre anti cheat system.. thats like the NFL making billions of dollars and letting anyone onto the field during the game because as long as they have a football jersey on they wont get caught. If you ask me they are stealing our money and are completely content with people buying 1,2,3, 10 new copies of the game with their excuse being ""smurfing"" (smurfing is when you log into a diff account with a much lower rank and completely destroy the other team to have ...fun?) It's pathetic and lowers Counter-Strike dramatically in my eyes as the greatest competitive game ever on PC. We must not forget it did pave the way for games like COD. Valve needs to stop being content with the $$$$ they are raking in and take back the integrity of the game. If that means hiring a whole new department to look into this and take serious action then so be it but for now if a friend just got a pc and asked what game he should download i would NOT recommend Counter-Strike.. Again i have been playing for about a decade and i myself come close to stopping playing all together sometimes sadly i am so attached to CS its not something i can easily do.

- I was legendary eagle and fell from grace due to ranking system update, its like getting a good grade after studying so hard, only for the teacher to decide to curve down all the grades becoz all the class passed.. its not fair, make ranking up harder but dnt screw the players
- Revolver.. really ? .. seriously.. why ?

Im focusing on finishing many games i left unplayed becoz i simply hunger for great stories

Its October 2018, I tried coming back .. but there's this new shit logic added to this game and its the Trust factor.. 
First of all, whoever though of this is a full retard. How the fuck is this fair ? Basically if you play good.. you get reported, if you get reported by lots of people you get a lower trust factor. which places you with a pool of other reported people.. this game dsnt ban cheaters fast enough. So in short.. Play like a God, be tossed to a pool with potential cheaters and get rekt. whoever tags along will suffer.. 
Personally I have never suffered this directly.. but i have 4 of my mates who are at a critically low trust factor, and I can guarantee those guys got no hacks.. THANK YOU CS GO .. keep screwing your own game with your own retarded logic.

WTF has happened? 

This game has the worst community possible, it antagonizes the one that LoL has but I guess here things are worse. If you don't speak Russian you are doomed to play in competitive servers with people that don't speak English at all in about 80% of your matches, these guys use the VOIP system to speak Russian even if they are just 2 out the 5 players in your team, their only communication is shooting you or try to kick you if they think you do something wrong.

DON'T GET ME WRONG HERE
I have a lot of Russian friends through other games and they are really nice people.

Apart from the Russians another portion of the community is immature people, they go harsh on teammates, bash them, trolling them and in generally trying to prove something, these disputes in many cases end up with the player being either the attacker or the defender leaving the game or getting banned for friendly fire, about 80% of the times you play you will end up playing a 4vs5 Match (at least in my DMG and LE levels that I played this year). This is a team game, you can't win by yourself but most people don't get it. If you reach a higher level of skill it doesn't mean that you are also a good player in terms of tactics and strategies.

Another negative thing is the 64tick rate servers that the competitive system uses, I believe this is set to allow distant players to have a decent ping and/or to save resources for the servers. This thing ruins the game too, it makes aiming really funny, you will understand If you ever go on a LAN server or play on a 128 tick rate server, this will result into playing a totally different game. The way the rates work now is that the attacking player has always the advantage as prefiring won't leave the defender time to react.

There is huge but in all this:

Are you willing to pay a subscription?
If you have 4 dedicated friends to play the game with I guarantee you that you will have an excellent time if you decide to go play somewhere where you pay to play like ESEA and FACEIT with a better community. There you will find descent people that value their money and are willing to play in a higher level without having to take all this *love* mentioned above.

206,"I'm start by saying that this was a great game for the longest time.  super simple fun in comp, causals or in the ""arcade"" type modes.  I've spent a many a nights with a couple of cold ones and freinds gathered around the appartment living room just playing on dust 2 for hours and have had a great time doing it.  However, this game is the absolute worst when it comes to people using aimbots, wallhacks, etc.  It used to be that you'd get one every now and then and you just report him and hope he gets banned and join a new lobby.  Since they made the game free getting banned doesnt matter any more.  They just start up a new steam account and jump back in.  

I mentioned earlier that finding someone who is actually botting would be a rare-ish occurance but tonight I attempted to get some new friends into the game and in the first 3 lobbys (1 casual dustii, 2 arms race) there where botters just one taping everyone from lundicris angles and distances.

I know botting is gonna happen but like dang, calm down.  Are you so frustrated that the only thing you can do to release that is to boot up a program and no-skill your way through matches?

So after my friends got killed over and over again but some resentful basement dewller, I suggested we play a round of competitve.  ""surely there wont be as many hackers there right?""  Nope.  Had some guy boosting his friends with an aim bot.  The guy had like a 90% headshot ratio by half time and could hit just about everyone no matter what was going on.  His account was permently banned by the end of the match but does it matter?  His friends accounts (that were being destroyed by my new-to-game friends) got a comp win due to a series of aimbot aces.  The guy who was aimboting has probably already created a new account and is back in comp right now boosting his (proabally) silver 4 friends and now I have 4 friends who dont want to play this game simply because of this experience.

This may seem like a rant, cause it kinda is, but I'm just tired of it.  No one wants to play a game with no chance to win.  The games community will die down evenutally to where there are only devout cs fans, botters and the passing interested gamer.  Making this game free to play was a big mistake that I dont believe can be ratified.

(1/7/15 update)  They added gloves to CSGO... Must have been why everyone was deranking, The old ones wore out.... Can't wait for Stat Trak Clown shoes...!

Once again another update this time destroying the most played map in CS. Nuke was bad enough. Old Nuke was great. New Nuke sux. Old Dust 2 great. New Dust 2 sux.
You want to fix something fix the anti-cheat I mean put an anti-cheat so the game can be enjoyed.

For all the noobs that cry that I have so many hours.
I've played since beta so that would be before the release August 21, 2012. The game now, Is not the game it used to be. Started going down hill once they added skins, Not for Steam but for players.
If it was still good I'd have many more hours then I do.
And yes I still play a little when my real good friend asks me too. Other then that I dont touch it anymore.......
As soon as my friend is done playing CSGO I'll uninstall....!

""I never leave a friend or a man behind"" (In other words I don't bail on my friends)


After reading a lot of the reviews I found that so many of them are negative with the thumbs up icon. So it ends up this game receives more positive reviews then it should.

If this game was left alone, With a fixed rank system ""Except for the mostly ulgy skins they add for more money""  people who really cared about learning and playing like a team the way was ment to be played !
This game would be great........
 There is a Mute/Block for thoses who don't want to know how many times your mom has had sex with a 12 yr old. 
But 90% of everyone you face has brand new account and has the reflexes of god and X-Ray vision of Superman. No one gets banned. Hackers will say ""I heard you"" or it's ""my smurf"".

If you like fps games this is one of the best games I have played so far that is first person shooters. The game is balanced on money ingame and you have to pay attention to your money unlike more first person shooter games. I would say many of the issues with the game is the fact that the game has some of the worst updates and has been going down hill ever since.

Most of the community cares more about skins then the game itself anymore and its pretty funny that you spent $15 on a game and then have a $1000+ inventory.

I would rate this game a 6.5/10 due to many of the issues not being fixed like 128 tick servers and better anticheat. I will change this when that ever happens if it ever does.

222,"Community is the sickest, so here I have examples of any type of players:

Silver haters. The matchmaking system are combine players in accordance with the skill group. People have found it fun to create a general idea of silvers as a garbage without brains and skill. For someone it is an accurate description, but not for all. Ranks are not for showing off.

Boosted ones. They are too good for this world, they are smart, handsome and incredible. But Gold Nova 2. And they think their peoblem is always with teams that not_so_good. Eventually they are ruining games with their conceit and lack of experience. 

Skin haters. People that consider it's their business to count other people's money. Also, they are confident high price skins owners are bad because... IT IS FUN TO MAKE A MEME ""GE INVENTORY (pic with sand dunes) /SILVER INVENTORY (pic with knieves). Ha-haaa, dem memes...

BOT lovers. Some people think the BOT will be better than the player that didn't clutch the round with 10 hp left and all enemy team alive.

Common idiots. Actually press f1.

I WILL FIGHT TILL THE LAST BREATH ones. For some reason they never surrender. A competitive game is played between the teams of 5 players. If one of them leaves the game prematurely, he receives a penalty, and the team devoid of player has the right to end the game in advance. Valve gave them this feature, but they prefer to waste time and lose because of the numerical superiority of the enemy team.

Tryhards. Goes without any words :>

Team players you can count on. People that will give you info AND call idiot, noob, retard etc. at the same time, when they're already died and whatch you. They don't know what morale is. And manners.

The community most valuable members. They want to be the bride at every wedding and the corpse at every funeral. This is not about CS:GO only. If you have a negative review, they hint you correctly you're an asshole, that can't handle the game, even though you have 100% fair achievements. If you want to take part in a discussion, but don't know some things, they won't explain it, they are likely say ""go away"" instead. 

Ultimate pro gamers. For example: you lost the round 1 by 1 with the enemy, because couldn't handle aim? Dead one pro will cheer you with the words ""omg what an aim noob"" or something like that. I don't know where they take such a weird ideas of omnipotence or invincibility... Everyone have equal abilities here.

Smurfs. People that find it fun to play with people that can't resist. Welp, as you see, nothing in this community is friendly.

Russians. Do you think I forgot?) Russian ones are odd. They always ask this question ""Русские есть?"". This questions is very mystical, because even if they get positive answer... they keep silence. So, do you want to met... or you just show off your nationality? I know russian language and I know what russian think of USA* (English-speaking people=Americans*), they are not silent about it.

225,"The recent Operation Pass is a disappointment. 
The missions feel very tedious and not fun to play, it feels more like a grind, only to get rewarded with your favorite three cents skin. I tried to avoid this for a month, but the only reason I return is to finish the missions to get my money worth for this thirteen euro ticket.

Update:
Grinded all missions to Diamond Coin and it wasn't as bad as I thought, tho I would still say the missions felt random. I wish tho there would be more coop missions like in the past operations. I think it is clear to say that Valve focused more on stars and the option to buy them.

In my opinion agents are actually a nice addition to the game, the SEALS or KSK ones looks decent. Terrorist agents also suit the whole operation theme and Phoenix Compound. 
I see Valve risked to include a female agent aswell, which is nice too, afterall it's 2020.
However ""The Doctor"" agent feels straight up ripped from Fortnite.

I don't want to hate, but I feel mixed about this operation pass. 
(In the future I will update this review.)",FALSE
226,Shit community,FALSE
227,"(Update 24th of december)

It's just not what it's used to be anymore..


Community:

COD was most likely known for the game with the most toxic community full of kids, but since cod got worse a lot of kids came to csgo and here is the problem. The CS community became more toxic now and it's quite Annyoing for people to have a squeaker in their team. Their voice isn't even the problem.. It's just that they feel like KennyS and claim the AWP as their personal weapon for the whole game and if you tell them to stop playing AWP, you just get a ''fuck you'' or ''shut up idiot'' in response. Now let's be honest, how many times did your mum get fucked by 8 years old squeaker? According to the game probably over 10 times am I right? Don't get me wrong, it sure as hell is funny to make those kids mad, but at some point, they become a pain in the ass. 


Competetive:

I used to play competetive with a full team, but sometimes you just don't get 5 friends to join and you just start looking for a game with 1 or  2 randoms. When you and your 2 friends found a game, you realize it was a mistake to play with 2 randoms, because either they are russians who were boosted and only speak in their language or you get 2 salty kids. Pretty much both russians or kids is bad, because once you lost 3 or 4 rounds, they start teamkilling and as a result they mostly receive a 7 days cooldown. Then you have a bot in your team and the game is probably lost. You are starting to feel upset and you are frustrated, because this match was a failure.


Elo system:

Don't have to say a lot about this right? A lot of people complain about the elo system in csgo and so do I. You're on a 8 games winstreak and then you lose 1 game and get downranked. Having a good rank is everyones goal in CS:GO, but ranks don't really say anything about skill anymore, because of all the smurfs. Yet you're eager to have a rank like LEM or supreme or even better... Global! 


Skins:

A unnecessary feature which makes the game look nicer, but some skins just cost as much as a car in real life... I know, you don't have to get skins, but so many people buy those expensive skins and try to make other people jealous.. I think, it's kinda sad if someone wasted tons of money just for a digital item. Now skins are not just expensive, the other bad thing about this is the amount of scammers in this game. 


Now if you look past all of those negative things I named in this review. Go ahead and buy this game. I won't stop you. This game can be a lot of fun with friends. Yet if you try to play it serious, this game becomes a really frustrating experience. CS:GO is broken, because of it's community and the latest updates weren't a big help either. Weapons like the M4A1-S that I used to play a lot are literally unplayable for me now oh and the messed up HUD in casual is still not fixed aswell as the spawning in teammates glitch. Hey but whatever instead of fixing those things Valve decided to add a new gun to this game. 10th december the R8 Revolver was added to this game and you were able to kill 5 people with one bullet. It caused a lot of hate, because this gun was like a freakin' AWP. They reduced the damage now though, but was it really necessary to add a revolver?

Oh also. Save your ''just because you're silver'' comments okay? Thank you.",FALSE
228,"It's legit one of the worst games of all time. (I rate it 1/10, even that's too high)
Let me explain why:

- The anti-cheat system
There is no need to explain how bad it is. It's so bad, that people are getting banned instantly for using skinchanger, but a friend of mine got OVERWATCH banned (not even vac) 7 (!) months after he started cheating. Good job valve. Oh btw, it was a public hack, he didn't even pay a single cent for it.

- The community
It's cancer overall. Seriously, so many people in the community are either toxic, can't speak English, or are just trolling around and thinking that's fun. I lost so many ranks and matches just because some c*nts don't speak any language or don't even speak at all (yes, there are people who don't even talk to you). If you kill someone in a cheeky way, you are called a cheater instantly. 

- The matchmaking system
Let me explain it: You are playing with 4 other people (which can be your mates aswell if you queue with them) against 5 opponents. Basically, it's meant to be competitive. But in some cases the matches are so one-sided, that it makes you rage so hard that your neighbours call the police at 2 a.m. Ranking up takes up to 17 wins in a row (I had to win 17 games in a row to rank up to global), but you can rank down 3 ranks after a lose (happened to a mate of mine). It's absolute bullsh*t, and don't even bother trying to play.

- The servers
64 tick, extreme lags, hitreg and server delay are enough cancer. But there are some bugs which are so weird and wtf that it's ?? For example, there used to be a glitch that if you spammed a buy bind, that you spawned as a spectator. IN MATCHMAKING FFS. If there are such glitches and volvo still doesn't care and add sh*tty gloves, you know that it's over.

- Valve itself
As mentioned earlier, they don't give a sh*t about anything the community says. They used to care about the community back then in 2013, when skins weren't even added yet.
In 2014, they added the CZ-75. It was legit better than rifles. For 300 dollars... A pistol... 
It took them 8 months to nerf it, until it was nerfed to hard that it was rekt completely.
In 2015, they added the revolvo. It was a pocket awp. It had the same stats as the awp, before it was nerfed 2 days later. After this, it was clear that valve doesn't give a sh*t about anyone. They kept adding stuff like graffitis, gloves, new skins...
In 2017, they still don't care about anything. They ""UPDATED"" the negev. Great update.

In conclusion, please don't play it. It's not worth your time.",FALSE
229,"In my honest opinion, the game used to be great fun but lately there has been no good updates for the game unfortunately.. The servers are very slow while you are playing, and they have been on the same tickrate for years regardless of everyone begging valve to give their game a decent update. 
The game used to be fun, but now its just bad because its noticeably outdated, regardless of the game being released a few years ago, the developers have had many oppertunities to update the game properly, but only release new skins, and cheating has been a problem in the game aswell for years with no proper action taken on it, anyone can sped 30 dollars to go and buy a cheat and not get banned for months, if not years.
If you are looking for a competitive game, I would say look a bit more before considering CS:GO, because the slow servers, constant cheaters and no decent updates, takes this game away from what it used to be.. And now valve just use it as a ploy to release new skins every month to make money off of, but put no money back in to the game",FALSE

232,"Dear Counter-Strike Players,
After a long period playing this game (~1000h) I think I have the advantage to write a better review than my last!


First I want to say thank you Valve for making a nice game like Counter-Strike: Global Offensive!


BUT:
There are some things Valve has to change really fast!


1. Cheating:
There are more and more cheaters every fu***** day! The VAC-System isn't as save as it should be! I hope Valve is working on it!

2. DDOS-ing:
I think the Valve-Servers should be very save, but then there is the DDOS-ing! How is it able to get the IPs from your opponents this fast and DDOS them! Please fix the Serversecure!

3. Smurfing:
Through all those Steamsales you get more and more smurfs! Highranks buying a new account to play against lowranks and get really horny about it! I think they should make an IP-Based system where the rank is linked to the IP or something like this!

4. Patches:
Patch after patch, the game is getting worse! They nerf every weapon till the weapon isn't playable anymore! With the maps you have the same problem!

5. Serverproblems (also Steamserver):
Steam and Valve aren't able to fix their serverproblems, so the game isn't playable because of laggs and disconnects! Also the cooldown you can get is very unfair! This is fu***** s***!

6. Community:
The community isn't as good as I hoped. Most of the people are pretty unfriendly.


Over all:
Counter-Strike isn't playable anymore! And the higher the rank the more hackers you get! Please fix the things I listed above and make the game playable again! And I know that Valve can't fix the community, but I hope the community will get better!

234,"Pros
-Cheap

-No pay 2 win

-Fun to play with Friends

-You get drops,so you will most likely get your spent steam wallet money back

-Easy to find an online match

-if you are from Europe,then you will master Russian language after playing this game

-Many community servers options

-A wonderful Esports Scene

Cons

-This game is like cocaine,You will get addicted very soon(not even kidding)

-if you play solo,Then you will get morons 99.9999% of the time

-you will find People who Thinks csgo rank is more important than Life

-This game is filled with cheaters(unplayable at high ranks),Trollers(At low ranks),Smurfs(At average ranks,you will see atleast 1 per game)

-Unbalanced Maps(Ex: Nuke)

-Unbalanced Pistols ( At close range/Medium range A 3100$ Rifle headshot does 89 damage,But a 500$ pistol does insta death)

-if you are a kid/ morons You will use your moms credit card to buy skins or for gambling

-Valve doesnt give a fc uk about this game,There are still the same bugs even after 4 years(ex: Valve DM).They take ages to fix even small bugs

-No Fun modes,This is a Really Really Really serious game

-No unranked matchmaking

-Valve Releases updates to Reduce your game fps instead of reducing bugs

-Prime matchmaking 

-Toxic community



1.What is prime matchmaking

you need to reach level 21 in the game(takes atleast a month if you play daily)and must have steam guards(To link your mobile with csgo account) to play prime matchmaking

Prime matchmaking guys will partner/face prime matchmaking guys(so this reduces cheaters/smurfs)

So new players have to play with cheaters/smurfs/morons untill they reach level 21 which is BS


TL;DR : if u have four other friends,this game is for you

             if u want to play solo,then you will just be wasting your time
     
            Valve anticheat is really bad,so unplayable at higher ranks

           Trollers(At low ranks),Smurfs(At average ranks,you will see atleast 1 per game)

Specificly wingman. I tend to meet a lot of cheaters on wingman who are not even trying to hide it. I never expected to say this, but cs:go is dying quite fast.

Edit.: To the questions and sentances which state use faceit. Faceit ? As you start on level 3 you meet a lot of people who are high ranks, which are annoyed of cheaters so they try faceit. But at the same time you see low rank players there for the same reason. Basicly i would say community created comp. system is trying to save the game, why not Valve then ?

No, just no at this point it doesn't matter if you have low trust factor or not.

10 CAUSES WHY THE GAME IS GETTING WORSE AND WORSE:

1.Skins are getting uglier and uglier over time .
2.WE ACTUALLY DON'T WANT MORE SKINS !
3.The FPS DROPS in the game are getting more and more..(As user with a good PC configuration i can say that firstly in 2014 the game was running on 350-500 FPS ! On max settings ! Now my PC is trying to run the game at 180-250 fps..
4.Cheaters everywhere !
5.Griefers everywhere !
6.Game is super buggy and glitchy !
7.Sounds are NOW RIDICILOUSLY AWFUL ! WE (THE PLAYERS) NOT ONLY MISS THE OLD SOUNDS,BUT WE REALLY WANT THEM BACK !!!
8.GAMBLING SITES ARE CLOSED ONLY BECAUSE VALVE CANNOT MAKE MONEY ,BECAUSE OF THEM !
9.THE NUKE MAP IS AWFUL !!!
10.VALVE ARE NOT LISTENING TO THE PLAYERS AND ARE ONLY TRYING TO MAKE MONEY !

273,"The game is not fun, it is not rewarding to play, you will not enjoy yourself, you will not make any significant progress in the complete abortion of a competetive ladder, and you will hate yourself because of it. You will spend your practice time either alone wishing you didn't care, or surrounded by players better than you that would rather call you a retard than actually offer any tangible piece of useful advice. You will spend your 'real' play time surrounded by people who have clearly not put in the practice you have, or at least don't seem to put it to use, and wonder why you ever bothered in the first place. 

You will spend yet more of your time watching professional matches and thinking to yourself either, 'I could do that,' or, 'I could never do that.' But it doesn't matter either way, because you'll never get the chance. The competition to become a professional is so fierce that you have better odds at surviving a stroll across a busy eight lane highway than even approaching the professional level.

Valve is so bad at communicating with their (unreasonably dedicated) community that it is sometimes physically painful when Valve releases an update to the game. Thinking back on all of the bad decisions Valve has made with the game, and all of the (actually quite straight-forward) things that the community wants and has still yet to receive after almost five years of asking, I sometimes find it impossible to believe that people not only don't hate Valve the way that they hate EA or Ubisoft, but in fact still defend and [i]adore[/i] them. The AWP nerf, the overpowered CZ, the overpowered AUG, the fucking R8 revolver, the timer changes, the coaching decision, the lifetime ban of players for throwing an ultimately meaningless match in a tournament completely unrelated to valve, the rifle nerfs, the completely broken pistols, the new sounds, the completely and utterly broken Tec-9, and oh yeah, the fucking pocket AWP that one shots people in the chest for $850, and the list goes on and on. Oh but, they fixed the hitboxes once and so we love them!

And all of this is leaving aside fucking skins. Talk about a way to make a game immediately turn into actual toxic waste: add an in-game economy based on paying $2.50 for a spin on a virtual slot machine that will overwhelmingly contain a skin worth approximately 10% of the price you paid to acquire it. If you want a surefire way to make sure your game rakes in hundreds of millions of dollars a year and simultaneously make sure that nobody playing your game gives a single shit about the game itself, there's no simpler system than a virtual goddamned casino. But, you know, they made the game so, like, good for Valve! Let's have a round of applause for Valve, the company that singlehandedly turned an entire generation into gambling addicts! 

This game is a broken pile of neglected shit with no redeeming qualities, barring an unintended engine exploit dating back to 1996, that the current devs have tried their best to kill anyways.

276,"This will be my first review ever on Steam, it's sad it has to come under these circumstances but after 2.5k+ hours on csgo I feel sick to my stomach and I want to let people know what's up. 

CSGO is dead, the devs are letting cheaters (mostly Russians) plague servers without batting an eyelash. VAC (the ""anti-cheat"" system) is useless, as is the overwatch. With the game turning f2p hords of hopelessly bad players came flooding servers, turning hacks on the second they get killed by legit players. I've been in games where all 9  other players were openly cheating, activating spinbots, speedhacks, wallhacks, no recoil and many others.

I haven't had a single cheater-free game in days. It's shameful for Valve to allow an otherwise great game to get dragged in the mud so pathetically. This is not just a huge waste for the industry, it is also a blatant message that Valve does not care about their community. To me it is disgusting that they would let down a 20-year loyal playerbase in such a disgraceful manner.

Edit: With Valorant coming out, one really realizes how CSGO actually is hot garbage lol. Servs are trash, the netcode is basically a diceroll meaning your aim doesn't count because the game is developped so poorly.

Even though my connection is less than 50 ping, with minimal packet loss, choke, and ""var"", I have often not been able to kill someone point blank with a FULL clip. Now you might say I'm just ""bad"" but I've been playing this game for almost 2 months(Yes that's more than 1400 hours!), and the game's physics are like my third hand by now. This is just outrageous that the official valve competitive servers can be this bad. You're better off playing on 3rd party leagues such as ESEA, that have decent servers, and more often than not, cooperative teammates. Moreover, the competitive servers are full of edgy, underaged players who talk down to the opposing team aswell as their own, regardless of your skill. There is an option to mute other players but that just ruins the entire point of the game if you can't communicate with your own team in order to fabricate a strategy to win the round.

However, a lot of issues exist, which valve refuse to acknowledge as issues, e.g. no perfect first bullet accuracy (hearthstone RNG), one way smokes, the terrible UI when watching demos, how every update ensures my 1080ti and i7-7700k can barely run CS:GO at 250fps, the volume of hackers on the game, peekers advantage, hit reg, inconsistencies in the game's playability between resolutions, re-doing maps and not testing how well they run, making people with lower end rigs drop below 50fps, molotov's random spreading, pistol damage and mobility, and gosh I could go on forever.

313,"EDIT: As if to further reinforce everything I already wrote, I have now decided to take an extended leave from CSGO. Writing this review made me realize that I had become complacent, and that I was suffering from Stockholm syndrome just like the rest of the community I bashed. To anyone who is/was in the same situation I was in, look up the ""sunk-cost fallacy"" and honestly consider whether or not it applies to you. I know it applied to me. The rest of the review remains unchanged as it is all still valid.

I have played this game for nearly five years, and all of the issues with CSGO are basically open secrets at this point. As much as I will continue playing the game because I find the fun outweighs the fury, I cannot recommend this game to anyone, even though it's free. For me, what forces this recommendation is not the so much the issues that people have been raising for years (64-tick servers, cheating, gun balance, etc.) but Valve's lack of public acknowledgement of these issues. They are much more focused on marketing, skins, and making money from tournaments than to actually even acknowledge issues people have with the game.

The community is toxic as hell. In public matchmaking, for every single match you actually enjoy, you will get anywhere between five and ten matches that range from a boring slog to an infuriating mess. If you queue by yourself seeking a ""quick play"", you will undoubtedly get matched with people who are playing for memes, playing without mics, playing with crap internet or frames, and most commonly, playing with crap attitudes. If you're unlucky enough to get slotted with a four-man, say goodbye to any in-game comms, since they're probably talking over Discord and leaving you out of whatever their plan is. 

I have only ever played in Prime matchmaking and I have this to say. If you've never played the game before, and aren't willing to shell out the $15 anyway, you will be in Trust Factor matchmaking, which from what I've heard is somehow worse than Prime. 

As for the community, of which I count myself a member, there is a pervasive case of Stockholm syndrome. In the long periods of silence from Valve, everyone has plenty to complain about - most of it is pretty constructive. The moment Valve makes a blog post, even if it's about something completely pointless, the community is all of a sudden praising them like it's the Second Coming. The majority of voices in the community (I recognize it's more of a vocal minority) have the attention spans of goldfish. Dangle more shiny skins in front of them, and they'll forget everything Valve ever did wrong. Then, the shininess wears off, and all of a sudden the game sucks again.

I have only been able to tolerate this game for so long by forcing myself to keep cool and be patient, as well as by having friends who have played the game with me. Many of these friends have burnt out on CSGO mainly owing to the issues I mentioned, and other ones I haven't. I recognize that I'm probably the exception to the rule, but even that patience has its limits.

Lets start this off by saying V.A.C. is a joke... it doesn't do much other than be a meme for the community to bash on. Valve makes billions of micro transaction and yet does nothing to improve player experience by cracking down on cheater and hackers. Every low skill competetive game is full of smurfs (players with alot of experience playing in lower level games) and or hackers. Valves overwatch program catches non cheating players who happen to have a streak of good games/plays, and fails to capture the ""closet hackers"" - or people who using hacks, but play a style that makes it seem that don't. 

""Prime Matchmaking"" failed to deliver on it's goal of seperating out cheatings/smurfs from players who wan't to play against players their skill level and have a good time. It was a good idea, worked at first, but if a player can get a program undetectable by VAC, how hard is it for them to buy Prime Ready Accounts, and get access to a phone number?

Rumors have been spreading on community forums that Valve is in the works of a ""Super VAC"" yet it's been 5 or so years since the games launch, and they yet to deliver on anything more than in game accessories (gun skins, stickers, STATTRAK MUSIC KITS, GLOVES, pins, etc) and questionable mechanic/gameplay changes. I understand they want to make money - but who is going to buy their products when no one is around because of the shakey servers and toxic/hacking community.

I'm extremely disappointed in Valve - like many others, this review will get drowned in the vastness of QQ and phony reviews. There is only one way to getting Valve to act...

Boycott all Valve microtransactions. I'm am no longer buying any more products through Counter Strike or any other valve game until they make reforms to match making. When they have they revenue stream in jeopardy - only then will they listen to player/community concerns and start making changes we want/need to see.

For current players, I feel your struggle, hear your cries, and share your rage. Stop purchacing valve skins, keys, kits, pins, whatever. Stop using the community market and boycott all valve micro transactions.

For future players - hold off from playing this game, the current experience will only turn you away and make your want to quit before you have seen the small glimor of light that is the csgo community. As well, don't purchase the game unless you are ready to pay 5$ a month for a 3rd party subscrition in order to have a decent competetive experience.

----------------ORIGINAL REVIEW----------------
I personally enjoy the game, and continue to play it frequently. But the point of this review system is to let people who haven't bought it know about what they're getting in to. That's why I don't recommend it. 
If you jump into casual to learn the ropes and play with other people there's a 90% you'll get kicked because you don't know how to play, didn't defuse the bomb because you don't know where it is, or maybe you'll get kicked just because someone called a vote for no reason and everyone hit F1 because it's a funny me me to kick people for no reason. You'll get abused over mic and text chat constantly until you ""git gud"", and then even when you do it will still continue.
If you play competitve to try and get better and progress through the skill ranks there's a 90% chance you will get yelled at continuously if you are last alive, pointing out everything you do wrong in their eyes, even though they are already dead.
This games community is absolutely terrible and while there are nice people that just want to have fun or help out new people, they are a dime a dozen.
If you think you'll be fine with all this go right ahead and buy it, it's an incredibly satisfying feeling when you can play, and even moreso when you do those pro™ strats™. But for new players this is an awful game that continues to insult you until you don't want to play anymore, it's happened to more than a few of my friends that tried to get in to it.

340,"How to charge for a game and noone complains

1. Allow cheaters and do nothing about it
2. Charge for prime account
3. Profit! The crowd not only doesnt complain but applauds for the ""anti-cheating"" measures

So out of nowhere you make everyone who is bellow rank 21 to have to pay 15$ to get prime. If someone is rank 20 and needs only few games to reach the free prime (i saw a guy who just needed 100 exp, thats ridiculous) gets literally nothing but someone that got the rank just before the update gets a free 15$ prime... Thats some weird logic, the least they could do is give a discount to the ranks that were close to 21 according to how close they were.

This game is fun to play with friends on a private server.
This changes when u play competitive.
8/10 games u will have to deal with cheaters.
Each update valve brings out, changes the game for the worst.

Instead of working on a solid anticheat mechanism, they
concentrate on creating cases, filled with skins made by 
the community. The prices for most skins are insane
and totally unrealistic.
8$ for a game, but 2000$ for a texture ???

Good job valve at creating money from nothing,
and letting little kids get addicted to gambling.

355,"I cannot recommend CS:GO.

Valve lacks adequate transparency in rectifying the ongoing issues present within CS:GO (i.e. cheats, game play performance, etc.). Additionally, the crawl to level 21 (i.e. a requirement to play prime account matchmaking, which slightly decreases cheating encounters) is grueling given that the number of cheaters in non-prime results in slowed leveling; competitive matchmaking consistently provides the highest XP reward, which is dependent on rounds won. 

Valve relies on a peer review system (i.e. Overwatch) to punish potential cheaters, which serves as a [i]do-it-yourself[/i] solution that is supplemented with VAC (i.e. an ineffective anti-cheating solution). Cheaters are not deterred as an overwatch conviction commonly results in the individual obtaining an alternate account. Despite Valve’s profit margins being nourished by superfluous additions (stickers, temporary graffiti, skins, music kits, etc.) the game has been lacking substantial content in the form of [i]Operations[/i], which are accompanied by new maps. The previous operation occurred almost a year ago, which far exceeds the average time between the last six operations of five weeks. Also, the gaming community is vitriolic - there are countless incidents of bigotry, griefing, etc. – it's a Sisyphean struggle of always wanting to expect the best out of CS:GO before being unfailingly reminded of its shortcomings. 

After nearly 1000 hours, I was left exhausted and resigned myself to the rampant cheating - I piecemealed together my own cheat using articles from numerous public forums. Expectedly, this resulted in me being overwatch banned after countering a series of cheaters in competitive prime-matched games. This 'other side' does not provide any reprieve - even the slightest tinge of a perceived good play, whether assisted with cheats or not, provokes the veiled hackers. 

I give up on this game as Valve has long before me.

There's too many cheaters.. too many toxic players and the ranking system is absolutely inaccurate that it's such a big joke.

Valve and Steam allowed smurf accounts which means that you are playing against what you think are lower rank or same rank players as you but actually they are much higher ranked players using their new accounts. Matchmaking is b*ll sh*t because it will randomly match you with higher rank opponents which makes your comp game unfair and a waste of time because your higher ranked opponents are just shooting you left and right without a chance to defend yourself and shoot back lol.. but you can't leave the game or you will have a time ban lol.. so basically, you're fu*ked. AND about cheaters and a**holes? It's bad enough playing against them.. but go queue solo or up to 2 or 3 of your mates.. and you will get either toxic random players or cheats.. you will get verbally abused or get penalyzed for playing with cheats in your team. Either way.. you and your team mates lose. The toxicity in this game is extremely high. Parents.. do not allow your kids to play this game. Kids and teenagers and adults get harrassed, bullied and stalked here. There are toxic players telling kids to kill themselves. 

I've been in touch with Steam Support numerous times and have told them about the issues I'm talking about here.. and although they have replied to each of my messages.. telling me about this and that and how they are dealing with these problems.. after nearly 1600 hours playing this game.. I do not see any improvements at all. They tell me.. oh report the cheaters and that's how to get them banned.. but little is being done to remove the cheaters, so basically.. anyone doing extremely well in games are accused of cheating lol.. because really.. we are just so sick of the cheaters - and with so many players being reported for cheating, legitly or not.. OW probably doesn't assign enough individuals to review all these reported players to ban the legit cheaters from those wrongly accused in this game. AND.. if you are wrongly accused of cheating by players.. you may get a Low Trust Factor which means you and your team mates will have a higher chance of playing cheaters in your comp games. It's a vicious cycle.. created by Steam.. who is responsible to fix it but won't.

So please report cheaters and toxic players and Steam will waste your time Not Banning most of them lol. It's okay to be optimistic (I was too).. but don't hold your breath waiting - or you might just turn blue and die. Valve and Steam are doing minimal work in removing these toxic players, these cheaters from this game and not fixing the ranking system and matchmaking in comps.. so I conclude that they just don't give a sh*t about this game. Who cares about new features and who cares about the new Panorama update.. if Steam doesn't fix the cheating and toxicity and the ranking and matchmaking system.. this game is still full of sh*t no matter what new ""improvements"" they add to it. This is an Extremely Negative review of CSGO and Valve and Steam but it's an Extremely Accurate one. Don't bother buying this game.. it's probably dying a slow and painful death. Eventually.. I will be playing with Bots and I'm fine with that..at least they don't cheat or give me sh*t lol.",FALSE

The lower end players the brand new players tend to buy game hoping to have fun and get trolled all the time. 

One of the current issues they have adjusted for the game is kicking players+leaving game are rolled into a negative effect. This should be 2 separate issues, If i kick someone for being an ass or going afk too many times and per that week I am already on a 2 hour ban from leaving a game I then recieve a 24 hour ban. 

So say you have a player that goes afk mid game how do you get rid of him wait til he disconnects to be able to use a bot to even the playing field. However this game allows you to mess with settings in console so now you have players going afk the whole game by running in circles in spawn thus never leaving due to creating an action in game. So the only resolution is to kick them...However if you have kicked multiple people or in that week's time had a cooldown you will get a much longer cooldown for doing something postive.

I paid for this game, and I grinded for the prime status. I cannot play any competitive games with worthy people anymore.

But if anything else - this game is pretty big pile of crap. IIRC, its march 2014, sinc development of this game is going only downhill trajectory (CZ-75 update it is). Not only swallowing up updetes has been painful, but also watching how problems arent adressed for yeras. But when volvo try to take care of issue, you can be shure that it will be one step in the right direction and atleast 3 steps backwards (ladders and hitboxes, sound, etc.). Eventually picture makes sense - brain cell non existence of humanity has been taken to whole new level. 

In the end there was only one ingredient that was necesasry. Despite about feeling that this game is more like skin simulator with jackpots and betting sites within past year or so, volvo did two things right - skins and micropayments. Without necessary evil Counter Strike would be alive in 2016? Not so sure. 

Nonethless about game itself, its been amazing years together with pro scene, lets hope that one day this game will become a truly great e-sports title and in 2016 it will not be destroyed by someones greed and careless, because with todays features this game have potential atleast to be as good as Counter Strike 1.6 still is.",FALSE

Okay Valve. I spent $20 dollars on this game only for it to go free just a year later? I want my money back.
I was really annoyed at the time this review was written, so pardon my redundant vocabulary throughout this review.

[h1]Valve taking advantage of their customers[/h1]

Comparable to other greedy f**knuggets in the gaming industry, today, Valve has set the bar up there with EA and Bethesda.
You know what Valve, instead of using all that money and resources you got sitting over there to give us, your customers, our long awaited sequels we've respectfully requested since 2004. Example: Half Life 3, Left 4 Dead 3, Portal 3 etc. You @$$holes think your next best move is to create a battle royale mode for a $20 dollar game you released 6 years ago, that has randomized loot box Activision/EA microtransactions? Hey here's an idea, Valve: How about you lazy f**ks start tending to the rampant issue of hackers in this effing game. By making this game free, you open a large window for hackers and other cheaters; they've invaded Counter-Strike faster than the Germans invaded Poland. Cheaters are just showing up in Prime Matchmaking; what the hell's the point of even paying $15 dollars for the Prime Status Upgrade? What the hell is this, Valve? As a matter of fact, I stopped playing this game last year because of this problem. Why make Counter-Strike: Global Offensive free? Ah, so you can attempt to hook and entice people to purchase your stupid $2.50 one time use keys for your BS randomized loot boxes to maximize profit.

[h1]Valve's Greed[/h1]

Your intentions, your methods have not changed at all. The one time you want to create content other than cosmetic skins to sell separately, you decide to jump on the popular battle royal train to maximize profit. I mean, really? A battle royale mode for Counter-Strike? Doesn't that seem a little strange and unnecessary for a game like this? What, are we gonna see a battle royale mode in Rainbow Six next month? 
Like I stated earlier, there are infinitely better and creative things you can make with all those resources. As if you haven't got enough money from hosting tournaments, video game sales and loot box sales, you need more money? What are you trying to prove with this?

The fact that you even thought this was a good idea proves your intentions, this showcases your true nature batter than anything else. You don't give a damn about the customers, the players, the fans, you don't give a f**k. 
You care about money, and that's it. There's more important things in life, Valve. You can make money without being a piece of sh%t.

[h1]Epilogue[/h1]

I can't support Valve anymore. I can't do it. This is the end of my respect for this company, who once represented the best for PC gamers. People are gonna look back at this and approach Valve with caution. I am done with you, Valve. After Dying Light 2 is released, I'll be looking for another source to purchase my video games from.

This really does suck. The gaming industry has done a great job at gradually pushing me away from it with their sickening lack of respect for their audience, as I have watched over the last decade how game series I used to adore have been ripped apart for the sake of loot box supply drop microtransaction systems, and Counter-Strike is no different. So all of that is literally every major aspect of the game and I enjoy none of it for the reasons I just stated.
Oh yeah and all of you writing positive reviews for this game today are effing morons.

455,"As I am not a friend from quickly looking at a game then glorify or damn it, I decided to write a review after playing more than 1000 hours. 

If you like skilled games and train hard to become better, this game is one you stick along time with it. After hundreds of hours, you still find ways to play it, places to hide, tactics to use etc. So this game greatly combines skill with tactics and teamplay and from this  I would highly recommend it. I also like the point, that you can obtain skins for your favorite weapons but to pay more for coloured pixels than for a real gun or knife is pervy. 

BUT the longer I play this game there are things that really suck with this game. A bunch of friends starting with me to play this game do not any more cause of some very bad issues. 

With more hours and over 280 competitives won, one should think to have become a better player than with 100 or 200 hours of gameplay. But fact is since the change of ELO system, which since seem to adapt to a balance of the ranks I (and a lot of my friends) did not manage to get a better rank than GNM, thus beeing MG2 before. This means in my case I am still an average player, who did not gain any progression in game skill. This I would have to accept. 

BUT if I do competitive MM in a full team, where no one is smurfing we have the chance of 50/50 to play against enemies who do have one or more players, which are far better than the best player in my team. So often they confess to be smurfs (People playing with a second account on a level much lower, than their main accounts), or they might be hacking or they are high level players boosting up new accounts for selling them later. So this is the reason that average players have no change going to higher levels. Valve might have recognized this issue since they intend a premium membership of accounts which are confirmed by smartphone (so it would be expensive für smurfs or boosters to have a lot of different smartphone SIM cards). 

In Casual Gaming people advertize that they use hacks, advertize for hacking websites e.g. a i m w a r e . n e t,  e z f r a g s . c o . u k etc. I did report them and looked into their steam profiles weeks after that but they never get VAC banned after weeks. Steam and VAC does not seem to much effort in VAC banning these people and getting these websites removed. 


There is also one thing that could be improved: Steam should provide servers with a tickrate of 128 for competitive MM. Steam is earning a lot of money from people ""paying to shine"" for weapon skins or knifes, so money should not be the issue.

If you are looking for a better MM experience then FACEIT or ESEA are your best bet. Giving Prime to every user who bought the game was a total joke.

462,"Play casual, play for fun... this can be a great game.  Play comp, or want to... take a pass.

This game has redeeming values, but there aren't many to be found in the administration of the game as anything approaching ""fair"" in the competitive sense.  In other words, the game itself is very good, very easy to learn, and very playable... but Valve has made choices that cause the playerbase to tend toward toxic.  This is a hard and fast judgment of competitive playerbase (as opposed to unranked casual play) because comp is a better set of rules than casual (all fires burn all players in comp, rather than friendly fires don't burn allies in casual, for example).

However, casual play being unranked and largely taken quite unseriously, people who cheat in casual don't get punished at all, since the only result of a VAC ban is that you can't play comp anymore, and any inventory items you possess will never again be tradeable or marketable.  [i]A comment to this review claims that a VAC will ban play for an entire account, but I am waaay too lazy to go looking for any more information.  Some guy said it, there ya go.[/i]

As you can see, I've logged 1461+ hours already and I LOVE the game... and yet, this is a negative review.  Here's why:
[olist][*]They've made the game free, which I view as an open invitation to still more of the unsavory, toxic element.[*]Even following submission of timestamped cheats, no action is evident on the accounts of the offenders (yes, plural).[*]When the game went free all existing paid accounts were promoted to premium (or ""Prime"") status: priority queue for comp with other Prime accounts, which used to require reaching L21 ingame to enjoy.  Now we all play against paid low level accounts run by smurfs and cheats, who aren't willing to lose their rank on their main accounts or just don't care, and so deluge the lower levels with abusive chat, text, and behavior - whether they're on your team or against.  As an older guy I just don't have the reflex to compete with kids anymore and whereas I used to find the ranks breakdown acceptable to find a match with others around my skill level... now that's GONE.[*]Finally, and the biggest problem I have with this system, is that when you drop below a certain rank you can no longer OVERWATCH because you're considered an unreliable veiwer.  But there's tons of known (bragged, profile listed, YT posted videos, etc) accounts that are smurfs of very high level players, and those accounts largely DO NOT DO OVERWATCH.  You're losing the ones who care with this system, and that should be obvious.[/olist]
I've sold my inventory, save for a few items with memories still attached.  This game was a huge staple of my social contact for a year and a half and I'm unhappy about the place they've gone to, but when I call things what they are, this game has become a pig I just can't support any longer.

WIll I play again?  Maybe.  Maybe this is short-term frustration... but when I look at othre reviews of players with hundreds and thousands of hours, the reviews appear to have pulled this game from mid-90s uprated, to around 70 [b]in under a week.[/b]

Listen to your audience, Valve.  Find better ways of policing cheats, and find a reason to keep the smurfs in their own brackets.  Start IP-banning VAC'd accounts (blah blah blah VPN blah blah, whatever).

The hitboxes are still awful because of how animations are blended and not snapped into place, you need to be rank 3 to play Competitive even if you're a Global Elite or Legendary Eagle Master, meaning you have to play with Silvers for 6 hours if you want to play Competitive, it's especially bad considering you have to buy an Operation Bloodhound pass to get XP faster. They should've just kept it the same as it was in January of 2013 without the flash boosting, the C4 planting and jumping hitboxes were still messed up but it was generally just a better game.

Fourth, worst customer support, REMEMBER, if you're facing an issue with the game, ITS YOUR SHITTY HARDWARE AND YOUR SHITTY INTERNET, NOT THE VALVE, THEY'RE PERFECT. They literally take the apple approach to performance issues with the game, instead of helping you optimize the game, they'll recommend going to a technician to help optimize the game and spend money there, coz the money YOU give to buy the game doesn't include tech support.
Fifth, though this can be included in performance issue, but there's times when the game will straight up freeze upon seeing an enemy or wont register hits even if you empty the whole magzine on their faces.

Smurfs:
Enjoy sitting trough a 30-40 minutes of getting pwnd'ed. Theese guys just figured that its getting to tough and serious playing their own rank and want a relaxing game. the end result is that you will have a not so fun game where a smurf, or even a team of smurf is gonna basically show your head down the toilet. You can expect the same acompaniying trashtalk.

Hackers:
Well, more or less the same as the smurfs, but any element of fun is gone from the game. depending on what level of hacking its all the more infureating. Spinbotters are ok, they will at least make the game very quick. 

Assholes:
Theese come in many forms, but usually its the one teamate on your team who thinks he is kennyS and will not shut up so you can try to listen to footsteps, but totally knows without info that they are somewhere else and that you suck. also in this category ate the  two subjects mentioned above and dj's, trolls and the one russian souting GIVE ME AWP and stalks/blocks/shoots you untill he has the desired weapon, and then dies because he hasnt paid any attention.

Kids To Young to Legally Own the Game:
Theese are just cute to listen to, but share many of the traits of the A-hole subject. They will not shut up, altho they will try their hardest to actually play the game. Tho they have a tendency to scream off your eardrums, ragequit and start to shittalk you, your teammates and the others, but its very entertaining concidering how old they are. Bring popcorn.

Other subjects, well, if you are superlucky you might get a fun challening game with people of equal skill. these games will test your reaction and teamwork. what can I say, theese games are just awesome and if you are playing with friends its sooo satesfying. All the different ways to take a bombsite or to get to a hostage, or defend it as the case may be will always be changing. Best to play with a full team of friends.

Csgo takes alot of practise, its not a pickupandshoot game. You WILL need to warmup, you will need to learn callouts and the maps and you definitely need to keep a positive attitude.

However as csgo is right now, 9/10 games will have a smurf or hacker theese days, and its made csgo horrible to play.To play any rank below LEM is horrible and will hell.

524,"*UPDATED REVIEW OF DECEMBER 7th, 2018*

It's been a few years since I left starting from the R8 Revolver. What has been added? Micro-transactions, music kits, stat-trak swapping tools, glove skins, CoD like operations...now? It's going F2P AND having battle-royale? Wasn't this game focusing on team-based cooperation? I guess not anymore. CS:GO is now ""Counter-Strike: Globally Sold-Out"". 

Great job Valve. The MTs weren't enough so you added this game mode to appeal to the mainstream normies. I sure can't wait for the Fornite players to come here, or maybe they won't. 


*UPDATED REVIEW of MAY 2nd, 2016* 

Gambling in Blackjack offers a better chance in winning the jackpot than the crate system. 

This is what CS:GO has become. Most people, not even gamers, only see the illusion that they can win some super rare knife instead of playing the game. It was the obnoxious ""Arms Deal"" update that struck down CS:GO into a trash game and the later updates only made it worse or did nothing to improve it. Don't believe me? Since micro-transactions were introduced, floods of scamming bots sent me friend invites in attempt to trick me and for weeks, I had to reject and block them. Yes, it stopped but the damage was done. Lots of idiots could not see past their greed and lost their items and complained so much to Steam support that they implemented those Steam Market policies that punished everyone who uses the market. 

For the other side that do care about the game to some degree, they're just as bad too. Just about any action you do just leads to an immediate reprimand from other players to the point, why bother even playing online? Then comes to the badly handled competitive system. When I did join, I keep on having idiots on my team or a player who would not stop mic-spamming and was kicked. I had to put up with this for around one hour and nearly all the time, the incompetence from my teammates cost me of a victory. Never again. 

And now, that ""Co-op mode"" has bordered CS:GO to a game like Call of Duty and Battlefield. The ""Operation Missions"" were one of the earliest examples of that. They have failed to regain my interest and trust in the game. 

Also, the community is toxic, more toxic that an irradiated area of Chernobyl. The community hub is filled with threads at the top page that complain about getting a VAC ban, trade scam, or competitive ban around 90%. The other 10% is usually a giveaway. The community is also hostile to any sort of criticism, calling out anyone who dares to criticize their ""holy"" game as ""silvers"", ""noobs"", etc and thus become narcissistic in what they think is their own right. Guess what? I played the game long before the ""Arms Deal"" update and the community was not like this. It was a decent game and it was much, much better without nearly everyone clobbering over a virtual item. As such, you guys most likely make Minh Lee and Jess Cliffe embarassed by forgoing the true spirit of Counter-Strike. Want to prove me wrong? Then don't leave those cliche'd insults in the comments page. 

CS:GO should be put out of its misery one day and I suppose until that day comes, I play the older Counter-Strike games that actually gives more respect to gamers (and the modding community, regarding weapon skins and models that had more work put into them). 

Can't comprehend with this review? Deal with it. I have lost faith in the Steam forums anyway due to the immature nature of people here.",FALSE
525,"An intense, story-driven game written by the community, brought down by glaring flaws. The plot revolves around a bunch of screaming manchildren locked into a constant battle for guns with paintjobs. Hack wars commence, scams are carried out, and viruses are created in an attempt to gain any leverage possible. As one of the many players of this war, you must choose your allegiances properly. Will you simply be another ""casual"" and be called every name in the book by others for poor performance, race, sex, etc? Will you become one of the elitists and make money off of the guns? Or will you maliciously assault your fellow comardes and enemies alike with verbal harassment?

Unfortunately, your character is outnumbered and outgunned. He must be a hyperactive drug addict, as he can run around at speeds that would make a Ferrari blush with near-instant acceleration but cannot shoot straight to save his life. He can shoot the first two shots accurately with some degree of randomness, but past that he starts flaiiing his arms around and begins shooting the sky in a vain effort to kill God rather than the other humans shooting back at him. Fortunately, your enemies are usually as incompetent as you are, so most battles turn into a spamfest of bullets as both sides scream racial slurs at each other and hope their bullet hits the other guy. Of course, a lot of times, much higher-skilled players posing as low-tier enemies will go up against you to fulfill their own malicious power fantasies. These people are called ""smurfs"". They function as boss fights and usually hurl taunts and insults your direction. Beat them to see them break down villainously and accuse you of hacking.

Of course, there are also hackers. Some are possible to beat, others are not. They have added advantages, such as x-ray vision, computerized aiming, and a jetpack that allows them to hop across maps at blinding speeds. Have fun with that.

The soundtrack is poor, as there are very few tracks in the game and most of them last for only several seconds, and you will hear them all within two minutes of playing. Valve does allow the purchase of soundtrack DLC, which only give you different very short tracks for the price of $7. This is a very shameful business practice, and one has to wonder why EA gets fluff for this but not Valve.

The graphics are rather ugly with blurry textures that look like they were ported from the original XBOX and lifeless environments. This is said to make the game competitively playable, but everyone knows good video games like Call of Duty all have giant neon signs and lens flares that obscure vision. The optimization is rather poor as well. On my state-of-the-art 2011 laptop loaded with an Intel HD 3000, the finest in graphics card technology, it gets a pitiful 25 FPS in menus with performance usually worse in-game. This leads to frustrating deaths as I see my enemies teleport around and shoot me in the face, or I suddenly freeze in place and again get shot in the face, in which they will usually taunt me with expletives. This is absolutely unforgivable for a game released this decade. My computer can run Crysis.

The loot system in this game, however, has much potential. The guns you can get nearly rival Borderlands The Pre-Sequel in originality, design, and neon colors. However, unlike Borderlands The Pre-Sequel, the guns cost real money on either the outside-game service Steam Community Market or by opening cases, which cost $2.49 per attempt and usually only yield Common-grade loot. This is disgraceful and exploitative of the consumer base. Gearbox clearly has it right, as unlike Valve, they never release overpriced DLC for their Borderlands series. As Valve have shown they cannot design games, they should hand off Half-Life 3 to Gearbox Software instead.

Overall, this game is outdated, treats customers like crap, has little content, unintiuitive gameplay, a terrible community, bad level design, and more. Stay away and buy Call of Duty Modern Warfare 17 instead.

New: Okay, after people asking me: ""Hey Axel, why does cs go suck?"", I gotta explain it.
My dear friend, prepare for a long review, full of bad english and hate and shit and stuff and... yea, you got it. Let's start with the most annoying thing,

[b]Physics:[/b]

Dear Volvo!
Explain me, how to ruin source engine that hard? Corrupting bunny hopping, surfing, sliding (if someone actually remembers this game mod), football, minigames, jail (i dislike jail, but feel free to get angry if you liked it) and worst of all, trikz and kreedz.
Why don't you Volvo release 2 versions of CS:GO? One for fun mods, one for competitive (which is shit, but i'll come later to it) and feel free to even sell it as 2 different games. I would still buy both and be happy.
why the hell don't weapons have 100% precision now while standing still and doing nothing? Why does every 4th-5th shot with AK miss? Let's make every skill game to a luck game? Like minesweeper, ""skill"" - ""skill"" - ""skill"" - ""now i need to guess"".

[b]Engine:[/b]

Yes, here you'll see all the complaints about tickrate, hitreg and interpolation.
What is interpolation?
As a player, you receive and send packets from/to server to ""communicate"" with the game. These packets contain the information you see later. Your ping is the ""speed"" of how fast you receive the packets. But no one's connection is perfect, so if we only used these packets, the game would lag and be unplayable.
So there is an old trick, interpolation:
You receive a packet, then you receive a second packet and the actual gameplay you see on screen is in between. This means, what you see, happens in the past and the server is a few milliseconds in the future. This is how you get shot with an awp ""while the guy was running just before he shot me OMGOMGOMG TRIQQER HAX"". In reality, the server has already calculated that he stopped and this is why his precision was nearly 100%.

Let's calculate the nice and fun interpolation in MadMaking:
cl_interp_ratio / cl_updaterate = cl_interp
1 sec / 64 updaterate = 15,625 ms every new packet.
cl_interp_ratio 2 = 2/64 = 31,25 ms for 2 packets to you receive/send so the server reacts.
It may happen that a few packets get lost and hits won't be registered on server but you will see these on your screen.

Now we have lag compensation.
Command Execution Time = Current Server Time - Packet Latency - Client View Interpolation
This means there are small mistakes regarding where the player is and where you saw him and you have to live with it.

Volvo could reduce it to minimum by doubling the server tickrate, BUT higher tickrate means higher CPU load, means higher costs and poor Volvo earns only [url=http://www.forbes.com/sites/oliverchiang/2011/02/15/valve-and-steam-worth-billions/]more than Apple or Google[/url] and can't spend more money to get better servers.

You can read more about interpolation [url=https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Source_Multiplayer_Networking#Entity_interpolation]here[/url].
And more about lag compensation [url=https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Source_Multiplayer_Networking#Lag_compensation]here[/url].

[b]Microtransactions:[/b]

Yes, I totally forgot to mention that in my review, first time i was writing it.
Microtransactions are just another way to make more money by offering unnecessary content. We've already seen enough in TF2.
Volvo thought, let's recreate the same marketing strategy again. And skins came out. Of course, what else could you do?
Creating new paid weapons? Community would tear you in pieces, dear GabeN, because CS:GO is meant to be competitive and there is nothing competitive in pay2win.
But money is not everything! There are even more reasons to add skins. There are people out there who love trading and collecting this shit (not to mention people who just buy em for e-penis).
Then there are operations. If not to mention that maps are often unfinished, some are buggy, the idea is not that bad. You pay for the coin and that coin gives you stats. But again, there are missions to do and completing a mission gives you a drop - really? The marketing strategy strikes back, even more when you get a case drop as a ""reward"".
Even DLCs are not that bad compared to skins. Why not making unfinished map DLCs like EA or Activision already do?
Microtransactions suck.

[b]Casuals:[/b]

First of all, thank you for adding a new game mod called ""Demolition"". It's quite fun when you want to waste your time on fast paced maps. Thank you for adding ""Deathmatch"" as a game mod, to play on official servers.
But how did you ruin the gun game? ""Arms Race"" now puts better players in disadvantage by highlighting them red. Of course it's better for new players to find these. It's maybe fun untill you get matched versus non silvers who start wallbanging you. But to the hell with casuals, we have competitive nowdays built in CS:GO.

[b]Competitive:[/b]

First of all, I am global myself and have played CS for 15 years now. And I can tell, I expected more. Global, yes, global must be global. You do get matched with people, I can't say they deserved global. I barely see the difference between eagle and global. Yes, these people are slightly better, but still only people. I expected to play vs people from high tier and not someone who ends his game with 3/5/25. Yes, some people have bad days, are sick, whatever. But this happens way too often.

Competitive bans are a joke. I trolled 100 games and got reported 9999 times. Where is my ban for griefing? I never got one.

Of course there are alternatives as ESL (which is dead in cs go, soon just dead) or ESEA. What do we have matchmaking for, then?
Also, it happened quite often that when Steam servers went down, I finished MM and couldn't start a new one, because ""still in game"". And you abandon it and get your 10 mins ban.

Smurfs, I have no problem with these since I got 6 smurfs myself. Anyways, all the new protection systems are useless, since if I want to play with friends, I do so.

Cheaters, the only thing I am positive about Volvo are VAC waves. Honestly, I think this is where CS:GO made a positive progress. Of course there are cheaters out there, there will always be. But VAC bans are perma. I could wish for was that CS:GO would cost like 100€, so it'd be actually painful to buy it again and again for cheating.

[b]Conclusion:[/b]
You ruined CS:S once in 2010. You still do ruin CS:GO. With horrible skins, with people who play competitive for fun (actually you people, fuck off this game and play competitive for fun in Call of Duty), with engine ""tweaks"" and everything I called above + sending most people to the ""new"" CS.

Oh, one more point. This game is fucking easy. It's easy as hell, there is no easier version of CS out there and there will hopefully never be. It is made this way so Volvo can sell it to 6 year olds and profit for it. Because getting pwnd is not fun, but the easiness factor is just made by money.
- This is why bhop is dead!
- This is why trikz/bugs are dead!
- This is why they don't give a fuck about the engine!
- This is why competitive went full casual!
- This is why you play this game!

You, dear review reader, are the reason why good games die. Because you want to win and master a game in 10 hours. You don't want to fuck around and master every engine exploit.
You better go cry into a corner about ""that one guy was bhoping"", ""the deagle is too op"", ""this game has too many cheaters"" and ""the ban system is unfair, I got banned for 7 days, because my internet died ONCE"". Do your thing guys and ruin vidyas.

This game is a fun game ONLY if you play with a group, ideally of 5 people. Otherwise, this game is UTTER GARBAGE.

The matchmaking is so broken that I can't even describe it. Even if it might seem balanced, you only get to play a ""balanced"" game 1 every 20-30 games, and even then there's a pretty high chance you'll end up with one of the following people: a retard, a russian who doesn't speak english, a troll, a hacker.

The rest of the games are either 16:1 in your favor, or 1:16 against you. And trust me, the ones you lose with scores like 10:16 are the worst games, cause this game TRULY gets the best out of you. For instance, if you play for about 3 hours CS, you'll need around 4 to let the tension this game creates blow off. It's unreal!

556,"[h1]A Sophisticated CS:GO Review.[/h1]

Alright, it's time for a honest and sophisticated CS:GO review, no hate, just criticism.
I've played this game since the beta of around August 2012, and I'm here to tell you that it didn't really get any better.
It went all from a competitive team-shooter to a game that's more about the skins than about the actual content featured in the game. For example, we've had a few operations that actually added some new gameplay style, but then again, you need to pay for those. And most of the time the updates revolves around some case with some new community skins in it. (Valve to lazy to design own skins).

And then there's the community, now I know there's alot of actual good people out there, but the majority of them are,  you guessed it, Russians/Polskis.
Now i don't mind people from Russia or Poland aslong as they play normally, which is most of the time not the case. Most of the Russians / Polski I've met in game are just general derankers and or griefers. Personally I don't really give much about a matchmaking rank other than the bragging rights, but derankers and griefers just take the [b]fun[/b] out of my game, and that's just not cool. The most important thing about a game is to have fun, right? Well sadly I cannot say I can recommend to play this game solo if you expect a fun match.

And then there's the new matchmaking system everybody keeps talking about. I've experienced it myself, I've lost a couple ranks myself, but from a personal point of view, I don't see much trouble in it. Ofcourse, it's not fun to lose 3 ranks if you win 9 and lose 1 and get deranked. But the real thing is, if you really have the skill I'd recommend playing other things than matchmaking. (like ESEA, FaceIt, LANs) I can understand that people get frustrated if they lose their hard earned ranks, and I agree with them that it's a pretty stupid update, but Valve won't revert the update anytime soon, so it's best to learn to play with it.

Overwatch and matchmaking bans are flawed. Overwatch doesn't work because most of the players can't see the difference between a good player, and an actual hacker. Sometimes someone makes sound, and the Suspect just has very good sound so he hears him. Lower ranking players aren't able to hear or see this and convict him of wallhacking. 
Matchmaking bans are bad because too much team damage and you get kicked. But for example, I throw a firebomb and my Russian team runs into it and stays in it on purpose, then I get banned. Also accidental grenades while rushing are also a part on this.

As this review comes to an end, I cannot recommend this game [b]anymore[/b].
It used to be alot better back when the gameplay actually matters, but right as of now, VALVE is only interested in filling their wallets. The result is a very broken game with broken mechanics, and not so community-approved updates. (R8 back in release.)

Seriously this game has a great history of people cheating and Valve tries really hard, but not seeing any improvement since 1999. Even recently professional players are getting caught cheating. I will like to say to Valve, when....... when will you guys stop putting your heads up your asses and start being less lazy on these cheaters. Banning them wont work for shit. You guys update this game all the time, but these updates are making us have less and less fps and for some reason, creating MORE cheaters. Why do  I have to pay for ESEA just so I can face less cheaters?

My suggestions:
1. Make this game $39.99 (this will make it harder for cheaters to keep on buying more accounts)

2. Go to these hackers website and buy their cheats so you guys can keep your anti cheat updated. (they update this every week or so)

3. Make it so their ip address is banned from playing this game. (once a cheater, always a cheater).

",FALSE
567,"I originally played this game back when it was still in closed beta, when I gained access to it by bothering a Valve employee (sorry, Jeep). Back then I loved it, it felt great and performed great and everything just made sense. Since then, Valve took over the game where Hidden Path left off and only built on it - adding more depth to mechanics and gunplay and even movement. I fell out with the game around then, as the focus shifted to being a little bit too competitive for my tastes (yes, I am a casual, and I'm ok with that).

Over time I saw more and more flaws with the game that turned me off. Weird premium passes, sprays that cost money, skins that cost money, lootboxes. Even gloves became a microtransaction. While I'm not anti-microtransaction (I understand that long-lasting games have to make money somehow), I felt Valve's approach to these microtransactions became increasingly anti-consumer. And that's what prevented me from coming back.

But then something crazy happened: they shoehorned in a battle royale mode to cash in on a craze and made the game free-to-play. I thought this would be the final nail in the game's coffin, as I reinstalled it to ""see how bad it was"".

Except it was really, really good.

Danger Zone became my way back to Counter-Strike. I ignored the skins and sprays and stickers and gloves and who knows what else, and started playing with my friends and having a genuinely good time in this so-called tacked-on game mode. 

The mode is very tightly designed. Matches are kept small and quick, solving the big issue in other BR games where you spend 20 minutes looting copy/pasted houses in a map the size of Texas, only to be wiped out by some screeching 13 year olds. Now you spend 2 minutes looting unique environments in a map the size of a small island, only to be wiped out by some screeching 13 year olds. The small matches also meant quick queue times! Plus, they built a host of battle royale mechanics around CS's mechanics, instead of the other way around like every other game.

And then they removed three player squads, for some unknown reason. Suddenly, I can't play with my friends, only a single friend. They even removed solo play, and began matching solo players against duos. This also resulted in much longer queue times, as people stopped playing it due to it no longer supporting squads and because of the weird new matchmaking rules. I'm not sure what drove this decision, but it actually did turn Danger Zone into the final nail in the coffin. Boutta head out.",FALSE

574,"From the moment I first partook in this illicit, nefarious substance known as Counter Strike, I was initially distraught, disillusioned with life, with my inner hope in humanity dimming immensely. Ever since my first interaction with another in this accursed contraption, which devolved into envisioning him preaching support for some form of radical ideology, I became wary of its inhabitants, initially deeming them all as rabid, saliva frothing fiends, that were effectively released primates, which insidious Saes scientists had abducted and connected to a computer. Overtime, my original derisive demeanour towards the inhabitants of Counter Strike gradually altered, I began to view them in an utterly inconceivable way, I began to regard them as humans. Perhaps it was a form of Stockholm Syndrome infiltrating and ultimately subverting my senses, but after witnessing such these creatures antics, I began to comprehensively analyse their bewildering personality arcs and acknowledged their intricate quirks and demeanours, that varied depending on the individual. It was through meticulous, deductive investigation that I gleaned a hierarchy of sorts, a selective system of power that presides within Counter Strike. It appeared these peculiar anomalies had an unspoken agreement of those who commandeered respect and were designated to obey within a server. To state it in a simplistic manner, the realm of Counter Strike bears four classes, each one wielding a distinctive set of attributes and a varying degree of influence. 

These classes can be located in any typical server, with the four social castes being simplistically defined as ‘foreigner’, ‘child’, ‘female’ and ‘adult’. Presiding within the upper hierarchy, lies the adults, a term defining a loose collective of individuals with varying degrees of deep, masculine voices, that emanate through their pristine, gold plated microphones and are projected onto any server they come across. Typically, the adult branch bears two subsects, entities with slight feminine lisps, that are accentuated by their inability to pronounce various vowels, with the other branch being zealous nationalists, who presume that they are Oswald Mosley himself, bellowing their political idealogue to a blackshirt rally. The first subsect, who for conveniences sake we shall refer to as the men of Sodom, are often envisioned preaching compassion and tolerance in games, all the while simultaneously attempting to solicit nude imagery from the children or female social caste, seeking to beguile them forth by demonstrating their aiming prowess. Contrary to the men of Sodom, the nationalists are frequently observed preaching distinctive political ideologues, all the while bellowing racial slurs and preying upon the conspicuous susceptibilities to all who are not swayed to their cause. At times, as featured by droves of Jesus Bots and individuals masquerading as George Floyd, the nationalists endeavour to bolster their forces and as such go on mass recruitment runs, dedicated to converting any with a fragment of intrigue to their zealous cause. Due to the conflicting demeanours and philosophy between the men of Sodom and the nationalists, they are routinely envisioned warring within many a game, attempting to gain a remnant of ground and control in their perpetual, tenacious struggle. Asides from the adult sect, lies the female branch. This branch is generally regarded by the most renowned of philosophers as the second most integral and influential organisation presiding within Counter Strike. Frequently this group of temptresses utilises their feminine voices to beguile any they come across, often being able to captivate a throng of admirers, who will defend their seductress to their last breath. Often this group demonstrates antipathy towards the foreigner subsect, as they cannot comprehend feminine voices and thus are not swayed, alongside the nationalists who attempt to purposedly anger the female caste, as a way of acquiring newfound combatants from their admirers. Based on the females ability in serenading a sirens tune, it would be prudent to be wary of this potent caste. Fortunately, as a result of mass cullings stemming from the nationalists and rampant abductions, derived from lustful children and men of Sodom, the females ranks have significantly decreased, making them a sparse and prized commodity in the Savannah of Counter Strike. Measuring at the second lowest slot of the social caste, lies the children, the youth of Counter Strike. Frequently, as a result of their nasally, high pitched, helium induced voices, equip with petulant demeanours, they are subject to much ridicule, mockeries that often revolve around the children being verbally beaten into submission from both subsects of the adult caste, alongside the females. Lastly, residing within the lowest social caste, features the cheap, unskilled labour of Counter Strike, the foreigners. This caste comes in all ranges, Asian, Russian, Spanish and many others. Frequently, as they incessantly gibber away in their own dialect, they are insulted from all corners, particularly the nationalists, who attempt to provoke the slumbering, indefinite horde. Any provocation or obscenity hurled in this castes direction often bears a minimal effect, as the foreigner is unable to comprehend the English tongue, instead being content in incessantly sprouting their gibberish, oblivious to the hostility they are beset by. Regarding the social castes, it can be stated that they remain a vicious and conspicuous feature of the realm of Counter Strike, with each social sector roving around servers, attempting to emulate 1920’s Birmingham gangs, as they extort and intimidate rivals into complete and utter compliance. 

Ever since acquiring a travel ticket and touring throughout this backwater fiefdom, I have developed an epiphany, a realisation of sorts. I have gleaned that nothing procures more joy in my life, than hearing the anguished cries of prepubescent youth, equip with the smacks of batons and boisterous snarls of adults as they yell every obscenity that exists within the grand tome of grudges at all forms of denizens that reside within. What else provides an inexplicable happiness is observing Asians of ambiguous ethnicity being slurred at by intoxicated patriots, who envision themselves at the glorified border guards of Counter Strike, critically acclaimed sentinels who will strive at nothing more than to fulfil their oath in purging all undesirables from their rural border town. Asides from the trivial antics of the unhinged, I discovered something utterly sinister, a note provided by a messenger that bears a distinctive, albeit ominous message.",FALSE

576,"CS:GO a game, that forces you to blow.

Counter strike global offensive, is a sequel to a game not many mention, that is the more tame and passive counter strike source, or at least by comparison. When you get CS:GO you will immediately know, that you're gonna be bad and quickly get mad. And if you aren't aware of the haulage of rage in less than a minute, your ""teammates"" will acknowledge and flip it on.

Never in my life, have I been in a situation where I wanted people from another nation to be on my team. Because with most of the american players, they do nothing but add layers of irritation and stress, mostly screaming kids or random mooks making bids for weapons while ignoring their dames, when they should be playing the game, that it causes such a mess.

The main game is all the same. If you're a terrorist your goal is to blow up things, like a horrible chemist. If you're a counter terrorist, you'll find yourself defending one of two spots like a minimum wage therapist. Both teams do have an alternative option, that they aren't too furtive about. Everyone usually goes for this route, and just kill everyone on the other team without a doubt. 

This game is not new user friendly,  I dare say it is quite deadly to newbies. To sum things up, before I get mad and break a cup. It feels like everyone is a 5 year veteran, but you are some poor letterman that gets headshot instantly and spent more time dead than alive. Your accuracy is off like a dead battery, but every bullet from each enemy is specially graced by gaben to carve a mullet into your skull. It doesn't help, that this games community is rancid, if you dare yelp everyone will shout at you like you're a whelp. Not to mention the huge amount of smurfs, that make you feel like you're in detention. 

Don't even bother unboxing, because it is outright mocking you what little difference it makes. All you can get is a skin, which is as worthless as the bin you'll put it in. All the guns work, but apparently aren't as fun without bright colors stickers glowsticks or prickers. And don't dilude yourself that if you keep trying you'll get a knife, it'll be a very pitiful strife. 

And the worst part, that makes the first statement of this review meanginless?  This game makes you always feel bad, I rarely see anyone glad to be having fun at all. CS:GO makes you feel like you blow. There is one thing that is a big deal to the smurfs, that they gladly take and seal. But the problem that always hits without fail is, this game is always on bloody sale. So for 40 bucks, the average chucks can have about 8 accounts. So even if they do get a ban, it'll literally be like you threw a rotten tomato at a fan. Just more of a fuss that oozes from this toxic community, like a wound full of puss.

You may ask yourself, ""why does this random delph still play it then?"" The answer is simple, like connect the dots with dimples. This game has challenge, and does need ""teamwork"" to make you do better than an allonge. Which you'll rarely get alone, it cannot be done. Bring a friend, because in the end it is better to suffer together rather than alone.

595,"[b]TLDR: game with full potential: 7,5/10, game with community on most days: 3/10[/b]

What is CS:GO? It is a game that uses mechanics that were last common around the year 2000, or rather around then some mechanics were absent in most big shooter titles that are still absent in CS:GO: no aiming down the sights or zooming in for most weapons, no sprinting, no leaning around corners, no weapon bashing, RNG plays somewhat a role while firing (that is how I explain how I have not killed some people at point blank range but I have scored headshots while jumping around spraying in peoples’ general directions…).

What is good about it? I like the basic idea: short and sweet rounds that require a plan to win. One team needs to secure an objective (most commonly plant and detonate a bomb) in one of two possible locations while the other team succeeds by preventing the former team from reaching their goal. You need to hide well and rotate around the map in a timely fashion. Map knowledge and tactics theoretically get rewarded. This is a game that rests upon a good idea that gets better when playing with co-operative people.
A thing you may not enjoy are this game’s microtransactions in the form of weapon skins and operation passes (temporary (!) access to maps and more skins). Be aware most of the community seems to be obsessed about these purely cosmetic skins and there are still a few elitists around who hate on people for not owning ‘nice’ skins (just a tip on what to expect from the community, more follows).
[b]2020 update: this game's microtransactions should have been its first major red flag to steer clear of it.[/b]

What is critically bad about it? [b]Valve do not appear to care about the state of the game, not the least about the community, or do not appear capable to solve its rampant issues.[/b]

In the many years I have owned the game little has changed, except for the fact that assault rifles seem to be harder to stabilise (nerfed), a major competitive map that got reworked came out worse than before and at some point Valve thought it was a great idea to add a fully unbalanced revolver that behaves like a one-handed, one shot kill sniper rifle, except easier to handle.
Also even in competitive matches I see players with high ping who lag. Matchmaking in general seems to be off. In my own unranked matches I have faced players with almost a thousand hours of experience.
More drastically, instead of finding an effective way to keep problematic players out they have added next to the competitive ranks new XP ranks and a system of cooldowns. So during your first dozens of hours of playing, you will often run into the game telling you you cannot play. Not being allowed to play a game which you have payed for is a feature, a bit peculiar how that works. A better solution this game really needs in my opinion is a more thorough reputation system that separates the wheat from the chaff, i.e. [b]ban the riff-raff, even if they're 99% of the player base[/b].

I have mentioned the basic idea of this game is very good and it becomes better while playing with co-operative players. However these players are becoming increasingly harder to find which lowers the enjoyment found in this game immensely. When I start Insurgency, Arma or Verdun I expect to find well-behaved and polite people in each session. Queuing for a match in CS:GO by contrast feels like playing Russian roulette. Playing CS:GO on a regular basis requires you to become callous or unpleasant yourself to deal with other players. A match should routinely start with locating the problematic ones and muting and/or reporting [[b]LOL, Valve don't care[/b]] these people. 
In the vast majority of matches you should expect to encounter at least one of these categories: a cheater using easily available and applicable hacks, a smurf intentionally playing on a lower level than his actual skill group (and hereby denying the chance to other people of having a fair match and ranking up themselves), a deranker or group of derankers who intentionally make their team lose the match (with or without the full agreement of the team) and finally a troll, griefer or other general kind of person who behaves clinically mentally underdeveloped. Only once have I seen someone who I'd reported get a VAC ban. These cheaters and derankers organise themselves in Steam groups of sometimes tens of thousands of people and Valve do not seem interested in banning or removing these. In general, policing the community is nowhere on Valve’s task list according to my experiences. This poses a major problem for players who cannot rank up due to being defeated by cheaters, smurfs and griefing team mates, hence being stuck in the lower ranks or “Silver Hell”.

Before I summarise this review, a few anecdotes of what concrete behaviour to expect from the community, all experienced over the course of one week.
- On a daily basis: players from the same few language groups of preteen to adolescent age that keep spamming the same expletives and curses in their native languages to you and never share useful information in a mutually comprehensible language. After a while and some googling you recognise the pattern that they are continuously expressing the desire to commit various sorts of rape upon your female family members and so on. Also randomly vote-kicked by these bigoted groups even if one is the best player of the team.
- Me: “Very nice people, speak English please”. Them: “[rude refusal]”. Followed by a whole match of shouting torturing my eardrums. Instead we could have used sharing information and planning to win the match.
- Derankers throwing mollies at themselves in spawn reducing the length of each round to five seconds.
- Two people claimed to be smurfs, they played with pistols only and when we were miraculously salvaging the match they started committing team kills, tried to get team killed, obstructed team members, initiated random vote-kicks, demanded we would abandon our weapons and more such trolling.
- From a certain bunch: “Mother Mary is a pig”, “ISIS attack Brussels, haha!”, “Armenian genocide is big lie”, “suck-a my brown [male organ]”.
- A Twitch streamer with a VAC ban on a three months old acount upon learning I had two friends with me who were new to the game: “gtfo, they’re [feces], NOOB, NOOB, IZI, NOOB, NOOB...”
Number of truly pleasant matches in one week while regularly playing: one.
[i]To state the blunt truth: if you get stereotypical Russian or other Eastern Euro gopniks, intolerant Middle Easterners of whatever persuasion, crass chavs (others more rarely as well), especially when adolescents, teens or even younger (virtually every match): you're f*cked 9/10 times.[/i]

I became interested in CS:GO by watching youtubers like Anderzel. However now I feel a bit cheated and I realise these people only upload the one in twenty matches or so that runs its course without problems.

In conclusion, the game itself in theory is easily worth 7/10 at least which is why some well meaning people such as I want to keep playing. In practice this score gets cut in half or worse. Be aware if you want to play and especially pay for this game, you are agreeing that you purchase an experience where you undergo abuse from the socially unadapted in all kinds of languages from all over the world, revealing the true meaning of the game’s name ‘Global(ly) Offensive’.

Some people say it takes over a thousand hours to become truly competent at this game. This game only shines if you play with trustworthy people. If you are not yet committed to this game and you have no four mates to play along, decide for yourself if you want to play something else, go cycling, have dinner dates, play with your children for a thousand hours instead of listening most of that time to overly disrespectful screaming (pre)teens who do not wish to cooperate.

I bought this game near the date of the release. My Account is more than 11 years old. I bought more than 250 games.

Recently my friends asked me to play competitive matches with them. I joined them, it was a hell lot of fun.
BUT - I was banned (a so called ""cooldown"") for each 21 hours the last 3 days because some kind of an anti-smurf ""feature"".
After winning 2 matches you will get banned (they call it cooldown, but you will actually get banned. Naming a ban cooldown doesn't change the effect). Valve FAQ says to you, this is no big deal. You can play the other game modes, like casual or against bots. Yeah, that changes everything... Not. The competitive mode is the only reason I started playing CS:GO again, and so will many others.
You have to keep in mind, you bought the game, and you are getting restricted because they want to prevent smurfs trolling around. But they do the exact opposite. I will explain that later in this review.

I can't say the words here I wan't to, cause that would remove this review instantly. I am so frustrated, seeing my friends play all night long, knowing it is so much fun. Yes, the gameplay is fantastic. Intense fun. But why in world isn't there some kind of filter?!
I probably spent several 1000. of Euros on Steam. The only possible reason with a healthy human mind would be Valve wanting the people to buy several copies of the game. And guess what: That's what Smurfs actually do.
To summarize: Smurfs buy several copies. Legit people don't. So Multiple Accounts give an ADVANTAGE to smurfs compared to legit customers.

This logic must come from one real brainiac at Valve!

And the best thing I just experienced: Even the draws count as a ""win"".
So: If you would play very close matches (which is the intention of a functioning matchmaking system) and you always get draws, you would get banned everyday for 21 hours. That's because you need 10 wins to get ranked. And only after this first 10 wins you would get rid of this mess of a smurf protection system.
This can take like forever. Even with 1 win and 1 draw per playing session, this would take at least 10 days. Beeing a normal worker, you can't even play everyday. Having a family or other RL responsibilities makes this a real torture.
You have to play a month here and there single sessions for 2-3 games, than quitting(getting banned), waiting at least one day (your friends might not have the exact same time slots as you do), playing another 2-3 games, and this until you reach 10 wins.

This is absolutely rediculous. A real shame.

  *********************** UPDATE 11TH of SEPTEMBER 2018 **************************

I can no longer recommend this game. 

As a 6,000+ hour veteran, I thought I had seen it all. I bought this game almost on release, went through its initial teething issues and stuck around for the long run. I desperately thought it would improve with age. It has not.

The main fault lies with its developer, Valve. It's relaxed and lacklustre approach to game and content development might make a nice working environment but they have utterly and repeatedly failed in their duty of care to the consumers of their product; they utterly failed to look after their customers, the CSGO community. 

We, the people who make up its community, cried out for years for a better anticheat. We demanded that the anticheat be more intrusive and provide rapid retribution. It didn’t happen. We begged for live moderation. We were ignored. We implored that smurfs and cheaters be dealt with QUICKLY. We supplicated for a forum to discuss the future of the game with our beloved developer and receive / provide feedback. Nothing happened. We were left in a cold void of total indifference. We asked for frequent operations. They were the best and brightest part of the game. The frequency of operations being released has degraded from one every couple of months to once every 6 months and then to being a yearly event and now, it won’t even be that; we will be lucky to see an operation in the whole of 2018 / 2019. Valve delights in giving the appearance that they simply cant be bothered to provide new, meaningful content.

Sure, we got glossy skins, big dollops of makeup and some paint slapped around to the more popular maps, some cosmetic boxes were shunted around the place and we got a glorious new UI ... but at its heart, CSGO has become rotten to the core.

Cheaters are rampant in this game. Cheaters have effectively taken the game over - and the only other game that is worse is the hell hole that is PUBG. Then, someone at Valve woke up and 60,000+ accounts were banned in ONE day. It broke all records. We, the community, thought it was CSGO Christmas, and all of our dreams were coming true. In reality, it made no difference; in fact, it made things worse as the cheater community simply bought or used new accounts and came back even more vigorously. The day after the mega ban, CSGO was on sale. Again. 50% off. Was that meant to be a joke? 

The overwatch initiative tried to make up the difference. At enormous expense, VACnet came and would have been a game changer. In fact, in the few weeks after its release, CSGO was the cleanest I had seen it for a looong time. Cheaters actually had the fear of god placed upon them, and they *ran*, fearing for their accounts. CSGO games became fun again, and the game was really headed in the right direction. 

VACnet was effective for a while but the moment the cheater community realised that all they had to do was simply buy more accounts to make up for their losses through bans, and then the overwatch was overwhelmed. Some valiant souls tried to continue on and battle their way through reduced rewards of 12 to 40 xp per 2 hours of case reviews, but the wind was taken out of their sails. The initiative was lost. Valve should have removed the overwatch XP penalty and open up the 5th and 6th levels of the service medals to the diligent and the dutiful but that would have required too much common sense.

MM ranks are worthless. Smurfs and new hack accounts infest the lower ranks. They derank any and all new members of the overwatch through sheer attrition of numbers as the overwatch members lose game after game and are forced from the overwatch as they can no longer maintain a rank to qualify to do cases. It is now simply so bad that cheaters have made their way to the most sacred CSGO price of all - the Majors. Were Valve asleep when some unknown and previously low tier team(s) began to openly wall hack in the Majors??? or were they that apathetic to the notion that cheating had actually reached the holy zenith of the community??? It's literally a matter of time before some clown starts spin botting in the middle of a Major somewhere and that will be the end of the game's credibility.

MM has become such a joke that MULTIPLE third party service providers make a financial killing by providing a safe, hacker free, moderator regulated environment on 128 tick servers. Apart from the occasional bitcoin mining incident, all they have done is provide what the community asked for. ESEA and FACEIT are simply doing what Valve should have done in the first place. And for them, the money is POURING in. Does Valve care? Nope. Most of the best players left and joined ESEA, FACEIT or the new ECL. Did Valve even notice? Not in the least.

These are the crimes of Valve. They created the best game in the world and through their own incompetence and hippy commune work style, destroyed what could have been a world class game and a major money making machine for them. All they needed to do was to put in a bit more effort and success would have followed. But it was not to be.

I won’t be buying any more skins. I definitely won’t be buying any more keys and crates or take part in some crappy 'pick 'em challenge' or anything like that. I will 'reward' Valve with the backhand of indifference. My money will go to other causes – I will move to another game - and I will always rue the day that Valve allowed CSGO to go to hell because they simply COULDN’T BE BOTHERED. 

Peace out.

The hit reg and consistency of this game is almost as much of a joke as the ranking system. It seems like kills are based more on luck then skill now.

Valve has done an amazing job creating and developing the game, but at the same time they [i]p1$$ed[/i] on all their work. 

I believe it's all business, and it's all for money.
Many players are banned because they cheat and are forced to buy the game again.
And people who don't cheat need to switch the matchmaking to [i]Faceit, Esea, etc.[/i]
[i]VAC[/i] is extremely weak. [u]Anybody can cheat![/u].

I have reported cheaters on [i]support.steampowered.com[/i] and no one replied. 

I bookmarked the steamid of the suspect players to see when they get [i]Overwatch[/i] or [i]VAC[/i] but aren't banned because they play 1 game a day so they won't get into the overwatch session and they can't get banned even when they play with ragebot. 
Reports on the profiles and tickets are useless. 

I am now “training” against cheaters because I have no choice. I win/lose being able to maintain myself in Global Elite .
I don’t think there’s a match without me facing at least one cheater.

I came to the conclusion that [i]Faceit[/i] has a really good [i]Anti-Cheat[/i] , but it's frustrating that Valve refused to secure the game better against cheaters.
I feel like I play on [i]Faceit[/i] for nothing. I can abandon any match because I don’t care, I have nothing to lose, nothing motivates me.

I really want [i]Valve[/i] to secure the game and to eliminate the cheaters. It would be a much better game.
[i]CS:GO[/i] could be the best game in the world if they would think about the community and if this wouldn't be only about money and people buying the game. I understand every game has cheaters, but if you really have the resources to stop them, why not? They created this game and instead of being proud of it, they just don't care, they just care about the money. Soon there's going to be matches like cheaters vs cheaters .

- Can barely speak English + Toxic af = Welcome to CS:GO
there are tons of toxic players which there is no severe punishment for them after reporting. you may getting bullied by teammates[spoiler](why you bully me?)[/spoiler]or kicked by them for no reasonable reason!
-Sometimes matchmaking become really unfair! The opponent's level become much higher than you which is impossible to win even a round & sometimes opponent's level is too low which makes a match boring.

You can watch reported players' match to find out it's clean or not[/spoiler]. after 10 right overwatches which takes about an hour, it gives volunteers only a few xp after maybe a week. this reward is a joke! players can get that xp reward by playing only a match.

Their excuse is that they ban in groups so cheaters won't know what cheat caused it, however this means YOU get to play against cheaters for 1-2 months before they get banned. The server settings are subpar and despite Valve being told this, they won't change it because that would cost them more. The maps are full of useless clutter the designers feel you MUST take part of.

They banned my server token for the skin plugin... on a private, passworded fucking server. AND gave me a 1 month cooldown for that just so i can lose my rank, lovely. Instead of listing all the bad things i'll list off the good things for this game:

[list]
 [*] It's fun at times
 [*] Maybe you can find some friends.... Russian ones.
[/list]

Fine let's list off the bad things:


[list]
 [*] The Matchmaking system is a fucking joke
 [*] Ranks only boost the egos of idiots and many people who're actually decent can't play with their friends because they're stick in ELO hell
 [*] A lot of boosters, cheaters or not it's amazing to play a game in gn4 and get your ass handed by 4 AFKs and 1 guy with 4k hrs
 [*] Skins are a quality meme
 [*] Banning servers for ""malicious plugins"" eg. skin changers is kind of hypocritical considering there's loopholes AND considering there's tons of undetected skin changers and it's not that hard to make one either...
 [*] VAC is a fucking joke, the only thing it CAN ban is Ayyware Bullshit from 2015.
 [*] 64 Tick servers are bullshit, especially if you consider that FUCKING CS 1.6 a game that's nearly 2 DECADES OLD had 100+ tick servers (Mainly cause they weren't ran by autists like valve)
 [*] Weapon spread / inaccuracy is a fucking joke the way it's setup (Not Recoil.)
 [*] Lower ranks are harder to play than higher ones because of smurfs.. (Maybe with the exception of LEM, Supreme and Global)
 [*] After a bazillion case updates, you still can't start a local server without using casual then changing all the settings.
 [*] The netcode of the interpolation is on par with Payday 2.
 [*] Their server utility still says BETA
 [*] Sprays.... Because everyone loves spending 2 bucks to get a spray they won't like amirite?
 [*] The cancer inducing community, myself included.
 [*] If you buy it to play with friends, worry not, your friends won't queue with you because they're too butthurt about their rank
 [*] Smoke grenade not exploding in fire bug, still not fixed
 [*] If you want to rank up you need to always 4 or 5 man queue with people who're really fucking good because there's a good 97% chance of a cheater.
 [*] Overwatch system whilst good, still bullshit because you can easily block the reports, and you can easily play 1 game and they won't get sent because you need like 9 - 13 reports to get sent, quality!
 [*] The market hold for transactions
 [*] The bugs with the steam mobile app needing to be reinstalled because the confirm button doesn't fucking work [On my S6 At least]
 [*] The half a month holds if you don't have mobile set up or change phone

1) Stupidly ""special"" gameplay needed, that differs from other games! Even if they claim to have ""fixed"" the whole HitBox system, is still s**t! I still was shooting people, seeing blood coming out, even heard the Headshot sound, but no reg. Funny thing right? Happens... (it should not)
2) One of the Worst anti-Cheat system (VAC) that even a 14 years old kid, with a really small knowledge of programming can get through that by-pass. Funny thing when they released this whole ""Overwatch"" thing, when you are LEM with 2k+ hours, and there's a Gold Nova 2 with 350+ hours to judge your gameplay if you're hacking or not!
3) Really bad gaming community including 12 y.o. kids from Different countries , having 0 knowledge of English. Same happened with older players. Toxic players are no. 2 problem, but I gotta admit, people are Not as toxic as the League of Legends' ones... 
4) Really bad servers, with the whole valve giving 0 f***s about it. (64 ticks while Every damn other Community server has 128)
5) Absolutely bad Game Support (you can't even e-mail them, you have to search deep to find an address to contact them)
6) SMURFS. I had played some Smurfs games on it, pretty easy and stuff, but NO worth... as I had my ass kicked from Supremes and Globals, and I was pretty mad about it, I stopped doing that! Many people just wanna show off their skill to Low rank people, are something more than Pathetic! unless you're a Youtuber and you wanna make some Funtages out of it, there's No reason to do it! And yeah, if you're a new player expect a LOT , but a LOOOOT of these f**kers around. 
7) Game un-balance. Cheaper guns are way better than Expensive ones! 2.700$ 1-shot kill and 3.100$ 2-shot kill in the Head! Not to mention 500$ Tec-9 at close range! As much as the Prices are so close to Realism, gameplay is NOT!

First of all the problem is same with other valve's multiplayer games *cough Dota2 *cough
Instead of fixing the game to make it more fun, they're adding more cosmetic items & more esports
Which is clearly making more money for them
The thing is while they're making more and more money, they don't have enough supports & employees to handle our problems
So, where did the money go to? I don't know probably more cosmetics

Let's say it like this

New weapons, anti hacker weapon? De_Dust that more dustier than before?""

Do you guys prefer something like that?
Surely not, right?

Or maybe a report button for ""[b]toxic[/b]"" people
So, toxic people play with other toxic people
And let people that want fun play with each others
The gameplay itself by any means not bad, it's very improved from cs 1.6 day
But as always community itself is a big problem
There are people that playing only for fun, but that's really hard especially with toxic people everywhere

I know this doesn't look like a review, more like a rant
So, I'll leave it at that. I respect valve, but I don't understand them
It's like they're ignoring us, most of the players all the time
They clearly don't care about the state of the game right now

[h1]TL;DR[/h1]
It's a fun game, but once the community is a big problem.
You have to work on your anger management to stay sane, because one or two games they'll be someone blaming you or angry at you
Playing with friends probably will make your life easier

701,"Yea.

Cheaters suck.
Not the biggest problem though.

Smurfs are ridiculous. Literally the same as cheaters to lower level players.  And yet no plans to do anything about them.  That one guy who got 50 kills and 2 deaths in your last game? He was just having a good game.  Totally.  Nothing wrong with putting you up against that. Oh, also, we're gonna do it again next game.  

Honestly the game is ok.  Casual sucks, but competitive is a occasionally good time, especially with friends.  Though I only keep playing because I have an unhealthy video game addiction tearing my life apart, but that's beside the point. The game, as is, is not fun.  It is not fair, balanced, or even remotely logical.  Loads of the guns need reworks, and the whole competitive/elo thing is broken.

----Skins:

        Ok you have a case now pay some money for a key... Okay now you won a weapon with some value YAY you are never going to sell because the colors are pretty. So in result you're just an idiot spending money on colors for a gun. You are too special for the regular skins?

----Competitive: 

         All you will expirence is rage towards your teammates because they don't do the thing you expect them to do. Or people will insult you with a mic because you're a noob even if it's round 1 and no shooing began. Or you can compare with your friend your rank saying hey I am in AK Gold I don't have any skills I just play a lot and insult people.

----Game itself:

         If you play none Competitive mod all you will find is either the casual mod which is good but filled with players who filled with rage because they are disapointed of their ranks on Competitive so you will end up leaving. The only good part of Counter Strike Globale Offensive is the mods like Jailbreak, deathrun, surf. But most people don't play on it because they play those awesome mods on CSS the real thing.

----Opinion:

Great game, but sadly money and popularity caught up. And now people don't play the game like they use to. It's all about competitive and weapon skins which is depressing.

 And now I saw they added a kill cam? I am sorry to say but this game died 1 year ago. If you're interested to play competitive and spend all you money on useless skins be my guest.

Even if playing Competitive is all about raging towards your teammates or simple rage because you think your good but you're not. If you got taste in video game, then buy counter strike source. 

I am sorry but if this is a good game for you, you are not better than League of Legends players and not gamers.

FYI there is no true challenge raising in ranks in CS:GO it's all about playing a lot no skills is needed. Counter strike Source is what i recomand no this. This is just a shadow of Counter Strike Source.",FALSE
707,You either die as a hero or live long enough to become the villain. F2P BR trash.,FALSE
708,"CSGO is dying. It is reaching equilibrium, equilibrium is death. The reason for this is easy to see. 

Since its release, CSGO has never shaken up the meta. The release of CSGO was a huge step for CS in terms of changing the meta; molotovs, new weapons, remixed maps, but after release, all this never changed once.

Rather than resetting the ranks every quarter, or even every year, VALVe opted to just keep the ranked ladder the same for its entire life span. Now, after 5 years, competitive is stale. Every player at every ranked (except maybe silver) plays identically, and ranking up is as impossible as it is pointless. Players who have been with the game the full five years have realized that matchmaking's fatal flaw is that if you don't start a comp on T side, you're going to lose. No matter what you do. Without a proper overtime system, CTS can come back from a 15-0 with little effort. Comp matches are far too long and boring, and ELO doesn't account for an individual players actual skill levels-- it never can and never will. 

Since release we still only have one official ranked map that is unique to CSGO, Overpass. Despite it clearly being the best map in the game, VALVe has never attempted to make another ranked CSGO map. Instead opting to just add in the worst maps from previous editions of the game, and gut them until they kind of work-- even though they never could. 

Even casually, there's only a handful of gamemodes (that no one plays), one new casual map, and co-op is stale and boring. They made Phoenix Compound for Wildfire, but that is not something they will ever do again. Even Hydra, which had the longest waiting period of any operation, did not come back with a new truly unique co-op campaign. You can't even play the game the way its intended to be played with your lower ranked friends without either sacrificing your rank you worked 5 years for- and even if you wanted to, the process of losing enough games to be able to play with silver is so tedious and uninteresting no one would ever do it. New players still have to grind for hours and hours before they can even play comp- where they'll have to grind for hours and hours to even get a rank. 

VALVe has never attempted to shift the balance or change the meta, has never given any incentive to actually play ranked, and never adds any truly game changing content. CSGO has no accessibility for new players, and no way for good players to play with their bad friends. Returning players are beginning to find the game as boring and stagnant as it really is, all the while the e-sports community begs for the same old things and scoffs at anything that'd actually save the game's longevity.﻿

The game is constantly being  tweaked but never fixed, we dont want battle royale we want a new opperation with new maps, we want 5 v 5 non compettative. Vale is money hungry and thats all there is to it. Don't get this game even though its free you wont have a fun experince. you have to pay to play with non cheaters and even then you will get matched up with a cheater 6/10 times  and dont even get me started on the silver rank. In silver you are expected to get helped by more experinced players, but nope all you get is arrogant screaming fwits who think because they  got an ace  once their a god at the game. even if you get a team full of helpful cooperative teammates (by full queing or solo queing) your still constantly met with smurfs who decide that getting raped at their ranks is boring  so they  drop to silver and take sadistic pleasure  in killing low ranked players. In conclusion Valve is only driven by monetary gain. I may only have 350 hours on this account but over all i have easily 9k hours. this game is addictive but not fun.

WHY IS CSGO FREE TO PLAY?! HAS VALVE GONE MAD??!!??!!


2016 Review:
[b]Pros[/b]
- Great maps
- Team focused
- Fun custom servers
- Skill based
- Become a pro and make a living playing for a team and playing tournaments/majors (Esports)

[b]Cons[/b]
- Smurfs (Master Guardians playing in Silver, Distinguished Master Guardians playing in Gold Nova, Legendary Eagles playing in Master Guardians, Global Elites playing in Legendary Eagle, etc.)
- Scammers
- Toxic Children
- Mic spammers
- Russians will bottom frag and yell at their team to play better
- Very Addicting
- Everyone is egotistic
- Hackers
- You'll top frag and carry your team but wont rank up because the ranking system is based on how often you win, not how well you perform
- VERY difficult to rank up, VERY easy to derank.
- Poor balancing
- Doesn't have 128 tick servers
- Poor hit registration
- Toxic community
- People will rage quit after losing 2-3 rounds
- No one wants to work as a team, everyone wants to be a pro
- Everyone thinks getting frags is more important than winning rounds
- Players often mistake friendly criticism for toxic trash talking and will become toxic themselves

The Cons ruin the game. Smurfs and hackers make MM (matchmaking) unbalanced, and make it harder for you to improve and rank up. Many Silvers who should be Gold Nova, many Gold Novas who should be Master Guardians. People will accuse someone as being a hacker or a smurf because they play well and carry their team, but often times the good players cant rank up because better players are smurfing and keeping them held down in the lower ranks.

For me, personally, smurfing is the biggest issue I encounter. Either the other team is being carried by a team of smurfs (2-3) or I will have smurfs on my team throw the game because they are trying to derank.
Also, since the ranking system is based on how often you win, and not how well you personally perform, you have to pay the price for losing and derank with the smurfs.
Also if you are playing with people lower ranked than you, (ex: you're GN3, friend is Silver 4) you will derank within 1-2 losses if you lose.

It is also almost required for you to have friends to play with, because in MM there are many players who queue on a regular basis, meaning they are better coordinated. 
(Coordinated team vs 5 stranger team)
And everyone who seems to be searching for a team are Silver 3 - GN1 or GN4 - LE. 
Sucks trying to find a team around the ranks of GN2-G4 when the only people offering to become a team with you are the players who are worse skilled.

You can win 8 games, and no rank up.
You can lose 4 games, and you will derank.

Other people seem to have more issues with playing with toxic russians, toxic children, hackers, and hit registration.

There are WAY too many issues with this game that Valve refuses to address. The updates they make are cool, but don't fix the game.

725,"Maybe in the beginning this game was worthy. But a division of the community is running rampant with unfair play.
Hacking and griefing.
Every game you get paired against 1 or multiple cheaters. Last match, a bunch of weebs advertising their hack and dominating.
6/25 Lost - Matched against 5 people spaming advertising their cheat. Everything listed below, almost no registered shots.
6/25 Lost - Matched with a griefer, spawn blocking inferno T.
6/24 Win - Closet Hacker on my team (still not banned)
6/24 Lost - Closet Hacker (still not banned)
All of June. I haven't had a legitimate match without some ""Super RAD skript kiddies"" killing any amount of fun whatsoever. Multiple of them even reasoned ""$3 accounts, who cares.""

The only way to even the playing field is with a ""you can't beat em', join em"" mentality on a brand new account to indulge in 'Fun' once again while spreading malice to get them mad enough to buy the hacks to have 'Fun', and repeat in a never ending cycle.

Closet hackers
-No spread. *shots never spray out of a tight grouping*
-ESP. Getting perfect peaks around corners, body/headshots through doors, headshots through smoke nades, perfect accuracy while blinded. (Ability to see your body through walls as if they're playing with the spectate ""X-Ray"" feature during the game)
-Aimbot or Toggol Aimbot = Countering a rush killing off everybody rushing or Clutching an entire team.
-Anti-Aim = Bullets do not register as hits on the player.

Rage Mode Hackers
-Mad spinning (RPM's that rival your cpu fan), Straight up BHOP into spawn and wreck your whole team (or enemy team if matched with you), all the while spam name changing and spam advertising the website hosting the cheating program @ ""X"" Price for ""X"" months licensing.

I was Master Guardian 2 before this wave came in. Now I fell 2 ranks.
Yes, ragemode hackers do get banned.
No, alot of closet hackers play with esp & no-spread only and usually cannot be confirmed %100.

^this whole thing could be cleaned up/worded better. ijdgaf
(EDIT)
12/28 - Couple months ago I made it into overwatch beta.
During the downtime, when this game wasn't in the limelight (Oct) for a while, the case reviews against players actually cheating was about 1 in 7. Meaning , a full 60 minutes of watching 6 players who have been reported for playing well with no indication of cheating. Followed by 10 minutes of 1 player darting his reticle to enemy players through the walls throughout the game or the occasional asshat(s) body blocking an awping team mate, blocking a teammate into a corner, teamkilling/damaging a teammate to low health.

When the holiday auction hiccup happened and people got free cs:go copies, that ratio went from 1:7 to 1:1.
Every other case was like a throwaway account not even attempting to hide it, staring at the ground, spinning like crazy, bhopping throughout nuke, dust2, and mirage headshotting every player they came across.  ""Hey look at me Get shit on baddie $0 accounts bro."" As of late december It's 1 in 3.

That's right, nothing adds to the challenge more than having to watch out for retards and traitors on your own team!

Laggy no-skill morons from far-flung lands who are impossible to hit? That's right, hit your router with a hammer and fill the ports with kitkat wrappers because YOUR HALF SECOND PING WILL SAVE YOU SON! That's called LAG COMPENSATION which gives ALMOST TOTAL INVINCIBILITY to anyone with an Internet connection that has no business whatsoever playing games like this.

This was once a good game. These days KDR stands for ""Kids, Dickheads and Russians"". Toxicity from top to bottom. ""But surely, at the higher levels, you get away from all that!"" Yeah, check out the regular reports of ""pro"" players throwing matches for money, using hacks at top-tier tournament level, and acting like 12-year olds. Banwaves are good for about a day, if that, just to give you a glimpse of what the game could be. Don't even waste your time reporting griefers and hackers, if you want to do something more useful, open notepad, type some Russian swear words (you will know them all by now) then save the document and throw it into your Recycle Bin.

Avoid at all cost. Play a man's game. Let the children have this one and buy ArmA 3 instead. Find a good, well adminned server. Ping greater than 300? *BOOM* See ya, Vlad. Mouthy teenager? *BOOM* See ya, Timmy.

What could be easier than making your own mustard? No, really. It is stupid easy. Grind some mustard seeds, mix with mustard powder and some liquid and you’re done. Endless variations exist. Remember yellow mustard seeds are the mildest, black the hottest. 

Ingredients
6 tablespoons mustard seeds, about 50 grams
1/2 cup mustard powder, about 50 grams
1/2 cup water or beer
3 tablespoons vinegar (cider white wine or sherry)
2 teaspoons salt, about 5 grams
1 teaspoon ground turmeric (optional)
2 tablespoons honey (optional)
1/4 cup minced fresh herbs (optional)
Instructions
Grind the whole mustard seeds for a few seconds in a spice or coffee grinder, or by hand with a mortar and pestle. You want them mostly whole because you are using mustard powder, too.
Pour the semi-ground seeds into a bowl and add the salt and mustard powder. If using, add one of the optional ingredients, too.
Pour in the water or beer, then stir well. When everything is incorporated, let this sit for up to 10 minutes. The longer you let it sit, the mellower the mustard will be. When you’re ready, pour in the vinegar.
Pour into a glass jar and store in the fridge. It will be runny at first. Don’t worry, it will thicken up overnight. Wait at least 12 hours before using. Mustard made this way will last a year in the fridge.

803,"Being [b]one of the most popular first-person shooters[/b] Valve has to offer, Global Offensive has proven to be [b]a major improvement[/b] in the Counter-Strike series. Its action is fast paced, requiring players to have quick and precise reactions, and team-work couldn't be any bigger in overcoming the opposing team presented in classic gamemodes.

The game weapons, models and maps all take setting in terrorism and counter-terrorism. [b]Graphics are refined[/b] and the game [b]isn't very demanding[/b] in resources, compared to other first person shooters released in 2012.

Weapon handling is a bit weird. Firing a weapon in full-auto mode yields patterns, so memorizing it would greatly improve accuracy. It encourages such spraying which [b]wouldn't be ideal in real-life[/b] scenarios. Health isn't regenerable, nor is it replaceable, meaning every single health point counts.

Since med kits aren't implemented, the next best thing is a defuse kit. It cuts down defusal time for armed bombs in half; 5 seconds. Respectively, rescue kits work similarly for tied-up hostages. Speed is a bit different for that case. Bunny hopping is and has always been a thing in Source games, CS:GO being no exception. It increases velocity of the player, making them quicker than those who simply run if done correctly. These are features that [b]wouldn't fit players who prefer simulators[/b] over fun. Sorry to bum you out.

With a [b]new gamemodes[/b] added, it is easy to get lost in them. In short, they are modified versions of the classic gamemodes, with the exception of Deathmatch. What's nifty is that [b]the community workshop has allowed players to push boundaries[/b] outside vanilla. Valve even encourages such creativity, with the addition of the ""Custom"" tab in game selection.

Competitive has shown a way of affecting the players and their play style. The players seem to favor bomb defusal maps over hostage rescue maps with the level of competition between two selected teams proving to be very big, and while the level of competition can be fun, it isn't uncommon for that to escape.

[b]Abusing the chats (both voice and text) is often-occurring[/b] in gameplay, which usually stirs up bad etiquette. [b]Foul play continues to be a major issue that poisons[/b] the gameplay to this day. Whether it is as major as hacking or just as disruptive as greifing, Valve's official competitive matches are constantly questioned as the best choice in competition.

The work put in to counter-act these things only do so much. [url=http://blog.counter-strike.net/index.php/overwatch/]Overwatch in CS:GO[/url] has people review Source demos to judge the situations given to them. Specifically, they fill a checklist regarding any suspect after reviewing evidence, which can conclude if they are doing such foul play.

[url=https://support.steampowered.com/kb_article.php?ref=2235-QYCN-3295]Prime Matchmaking[/url] is another act by Valve, which has the players insert their phone number. This was to make sure [url=https://support.steampowered.com/kb_article.php?ref=7849-Radz-6869]VAC bans[/url] are more severe, and to have Prime Accounts group up in matchmaking. If a Prime Account was VAC banned, all accounts that use the number in the future will be ineligible for Prime Matchmaking. Only one account can use the number at a time, so be careful and choose one account you want to have do Prime Matchmaking. Of course, you have the option to prioritize Prime Matches, instead of strictly competing in these matches.

Even so, this [b]unfair gameplay has gotten so wide-spread[/b] in matchmaking. It goes up to the point where [b]falsely accusing one person of cheating occurs[/b] every now and then, being another fuel for saltiness. [b]Smurfing also ruins gameplay[/b] for others. Playing on ranks set for those of lower skill levels than you disrupts the fun for many. It's a thing that gets overlooked, leaving smurfs to further damage gameplay.

Leveling to 21 takes a TON of time atleast a month guaranteed since they only have weekly bonuses and you get a decreased amont of XP the more you play which stacks throughout the week.

Players who aren't in priority consist of cheaters (mainly wall hackers) and smurfs resulting in a TERRIBLE gameplay experience .

If you play ranked (competetive) matches and lets say again you are at least above average player you could be top player almost in every match (ofcorse lets hope u don't run into cheater or some skilled player on smurf account) and you would gain ranks relativly easy ofcorse higher rank = higher skill group so more chance to meet your skill level people or better then you (remeber there always someone better, nobody is godlike).

2: Hackers are very abundant all throughout the game. You will most likely run into a hacker at the very least once every 10 or so games. If you legit think that there are not many hackers in this game, you are sorely mistaken.

3: The community is worse than CoD's community nowadays. They will make bullshit arguments about the guns, troll, among other things. It is sad just how low some can go, if you want to see that low, this is the game for it.

4: Horrid matchmaking system. I get it, you can only do so much, but from the amount of times I have been paired up with people i should not have, or been put into russians servers, its just stupid.

5: Boosting. So many horrible players have been boosted by their friends, or hackers, or both into the high ranks. Then when you play with them they are worse than a bot for your team. 

6: 64 Tick servers and horrible hit reg problems. The servers are not good, you will encounter many times when you saw your bullet go through the person you were shooting at simply because what your client saw, and the server saw, are two different things. For a fast paced shooter such as csgo, that is very very bad.

All in all csgo was fun, i enjoyed it for a time. That time has long since past. This game could be one of the best of its kind if somebody showed it some proper TLC. Fixed up VAC, upgraded the servers. Helped prevent smurfing to some extent. Now im not somebody with their head in the clouds thinking that everything in this game could be fixed and it would be a perfect game. No, that is not realistic, some of the problems do need fixing though. Maybe one day Valve will care enough to solve them, but i find that to be highly doubtful. If you are looking to become angry, get violent with strangers and friends alike, want to have a stroke and lose your hair through either stress or you pulling it out yourself, this is the game for you.

Edit:As of 3/29/2016 there are even more hackers than before. Wallers are in about every 1 in 3 games. Most of them don't even bother hiding it that well due to bans being so avoidable in this game. Ever since polyhacks were released to the public people have been walling like crazy. Don't believe me? thats ok go look on m p g h and see the massive hacking community at work.",FALSE

860,"2022 edit: Infested with all kinds of cheaters, dude blatantly uses spinbot 2 months ago, saved his profile after report to check if he'll get banned and he's still fine and keeps playing CS GO. VAC is a joke.


I've been playing CS 1.6 since after its' release, hell i've been playing CS since the release of 1.5 even(Mainly on non-steam LAN tho, i must confess) and thus far this is probably the best. it has the smooth and proper aim of 1.5 for most part when it counts, the accuracy of pistols are absolutely nostalgic in it and all pistols are actually worth playing with now with the change in damages. when it comes to SMGs and Rifles it's much more similar to 1.6 in early days except for AK47, GOD knows how i missed the super-accurate AK47 from 1.6. It also makes more sense to play with Galil and Famas now. About the sniper, well...i've never used sniper when it was serious but an amazing sniper i knew got interested in this game after playing around with AWP and SSG for around 10minutes. Almost forgot about the Heavy group of loadout being muuuuch more fun to play now and how the shotguns aren't useless from more than 10meters away.
The only thing which was abit harder to enjoy on this release was jumping. Harder than 1.6 but with much more of a...kinda...air-control, guess i should say. Might be annoying at first, but you'll surely enjoy it after getting used to it.
On top of all those improvements, there are weapon skins now making it more fun for the casual players.
Another thing worthy of mentioning would be netcode improvements. Since i've always played videogames with higher amounts of pingtime i've been more careful about that part. in CS:GO you get to search for servers with pings as high as 350ms! Now...it doesn't really sound good when said alone, but the netcode is done well enough to make sure it's still playable with such high latency(However you have to cover the high ping time with better and faster reflexes at the end again).
On a last note, i really hope valve improves the source engine. A little bit prettier envirounment and characters while saving the simple-looking options wouldn't hurt.

Anyway after more time + money and nerves invested to this game I bring you this.

If you're looking for a review on this game you've come to the wrong place, but if you're looking for an outstanding pie recipe you've come to the right place.

Ingredients:

1. 6 tablespoons unsalted butter
2. 1/2 cup white sugar
3. 1/2 cup brown sugar
4. 1/4 cup water
5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon
6. 1 pinch salt
7. 5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced
8. 1 pastry for double-crust pie

Directions:

1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.
3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.
4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.
5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.
6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing.",FALSE
869,"too many cheaters, valve won't do anything about it.",FALSE
870,"I am in the Counter Strike Scene since Source came out in 2004. I was 10 years old when I played Counter Strike for the very first time. The steep learning curve was something I struggled the most. It was basically like a on-off relationship but still something hindered me from quit Counter Strike completely so I kept grinding. Fast forward: As a 23-year-old I purchased Counter Strike: Global Offensive about a year ago and yet I lost the passion to the game completely; leaving anything but frustration and desperation.
There were many reasons and some of them I would like to point out here: 

First the community itself is like someone ordered tons of salt via Amazon Prime in regular basis. There were occasions where I queued up with players who are just straight up idiots or going full retard. People are throwing words or swearing to each other >.> or searching for an escapegoat for their own mistake(s). Also communicationwise it is challenging when people are not willing to give any callouts or even to speak at all; leaving you in a spot where you have to lonewolf the match pretty much. Oh and then there are those who are just jump out of the boat in a in-game session. 

Second while Valve may found another idea to milk out money from the players (which is really sad), it kinda shifts the image where players value cosmetic items more than the actual meta of the game. 
It is quite sad that a company such as Valve came so lately to fight against 3rd party gambling sites. There were reports about people (youtubers, professional players, streamers etc.) who were or are still involved into the cs:go gambling scandal. Skin trading became a million $$$ business and Valve knows it cannot be easily shut off. 

Lastly the hitbox mechanics in this game are atrocious (in not any hyperbolic way). 
There were moments where I left the firefight with a big question mark over my head. People telling me to 'git gud' but it has been proven over and over again that the hitbox in this game is acting weird. 
There were situations where the shots not being registered; leaving me with a big confusion like emptying my whole glock or usp mag to a guy's head and nothing happens - yeah that type of confusion.  

Even though I poured my heart and soul into the game for years, I cannot recommend this game. If players would realize for once that in this game there is no ""I"" but a ""we"", not 
p-r-o-s-t-i-t-u-t-e themselves for skins and if Valve care about this game for once by fixing those issues such as the hitboxes, this game could shine in a different way. But right now it is time to lay off CS:GO to bed.

UPDATE 4/27: Due to the shitstorm around Battlefront 2 about the questionable lootboxes, the fire has spread over to other (triple A) game titles. Measures by several states has been taken: Belgium and the Netherlands declared lootboxes as gambling. Belgium even went further and declared loot boxes in video games are illegal.

I don't think so, never seen any kind VAC since coming back to title on new account, apart of times when I was in non-prime. Another problem with the game is huge amount of toxicity, people who think they are awesome for either selecting Mirage and losing or people who curse at others while losing rounds just beacuse they die themselves.

So that is one problem.
Instead of doing it the way left 4 dead 2 was doing the workshop became a toy making factory because the majority of the people upvotes Borderlands 2 style of weapon camo's.
You will finaly see yourself spending alot of hours consentrating on the screen and doing workout with your fingers. When i bought the game it was playable on my laptop with around 40-75 fps. After the workshop update it got worse every time. now i can barely get 30 fps.

893,"Добрый вечерочек. Ну, как добрый, не очень. 
Сел, значит, поиграть в кс, всё отлично, а тут неведомый, ну, сами понимаете.
Если вы начали играть в кс, то обязательно возле себя поставьте валерьянку или что-то успокоительное, потому что эта игра не даст вам нормальной жизни. КС-это наркотик. Если вы один раз зашли и вам понравилось, то всё, вы повязните в ней и никогда не найдёте выход из этой наркотической, до боли разрывающей сердце КС. 
Так вот, я в этой зависимости, чуть больше (на 17.01.17г) 2500 часов. Зайдя первый раз в кс, могу дать совет, выключите игру и потом удалите (спасаю ваши жизни). Я зашёл и мне никто не сказал, что со мной будет. Нет, я не стал жирным диваным экспертом по кс. Я стал зависим от игры и не могу остановиться. Печально. Стало хуже...

Вторая часть всего этого бессмысленного обзора заключается в  отношение игры к нам,а также нашими всеми любими разработчиками игры. 
Зайдя в игру, вы не сможете направиться в мм и покатать с друзьями, вы обязательно должны дойти отметочку в третье звание (которое непонятно зачем ввели, видимо готовят людей к армии), и вам приходится играть на пабах и в других ИНТЕРЕСНЫХ режимах. И вот на этом этапе вы встречаете людей, которые стреляют лучше вас, но вы не подозреваете, что они используют АЙ-Я-ЯЙ какие плохие программы, которые дают им возможность взорвать ваш пуканчик. Ну ладно, предположим, что у вас руки Бога и вы добрались до того момента, когда можете поиграть с друзьми, но встречается следующая беда! Явно ваши друзья выше уровня и как назло в вашей комании вас всего четыре человека! ВЫ думате ничего страшного, но вы ошибаетесь, вас не пустят играть в игрулю, пототу что вы нуб и салага, не батя кс (или просто у друзей большое звание, но кс вас всё равно опустит до нуба). На этот случай я вам советую завести новых друзей и ровно пять (обратите внимание, чтобы не оказалось тех людей, которые сдаются сразу, как начинается война. Ха-ха, смешная шутка, Поляки). 
Поговорим о поляках- этот народ ""очень добрый"" и будет с вами обращаться, как с Богом, ой, с говном. Вы научитесь говорить по польски лучше, чем сейчас вы знаете свой язык. Ладно, не стоит задерживаться на этих людях, потому что если вы не собрали себе стак (команду), то вас ждут люди, которые будут троллить, морально унижать, мешать игре, но особенно разговаривать о ваших родителях. 
Вот ты молодец, начал играть, выиграл первую игру, выиграл вторую, но видишь надпись ""Дорогой, давай ты поиграешь через день"" и когда все твои друзья играют дальше, то ты в это время смотришь на таймер, когда тебе дадут поиграть. И представляешь, тебе надо будет сидеть так пять раз, чтобы дождаться этого славного дня, когда ты сможешь играть бесконечно, пока не убьешь своего напарника и тебе не дадут бан. Запомни, что бан увеличивается, если в тебе сидит маленький убийца своих друзей, ну или поляка. 
Думаю, что ты прочитал это и больше не играешь в игру. Но что за, ты продолжаешь дальше!
Ну ладно, продолжим. Есть такая штука, как открытие кейсов, ох, зря я это говорю, так вот, ЗАБУДЬ! Если я увижу, что ты открываешь кейсы, то мы найдём тебя и получишь по попе! Переходим плавно к разработчикам. 
Да, эти люди молодцы, стараются и делают годный контент и обновления, но есть одно но.. Для вас эти обновления будут не очень. С каждым новым обновлением игра становится хуже и хуже. Вы хотите, чтобы вам исправили баги-получите новые звуки. Вы хотите, чтобы система рангов была понятной-получите кейс со скинами. Понимаю, надо кормить семью чёрной икрой на Мальдивах, но почему нельзя сделать что-то, что может быть полезным?

Ладно, мой друг, мне надоело писать этот обзор, всё равно он бесполезный. Надеюсь ты запомнил, что играть в эту игру не надо., ибо она убьёт тебя. Плюсы игры: можно убить курочек.

897,"""2 days ago, December 7, 2018, a date which will live...in gamer infamy. the veteran CSGO community, was violently and deliberately attacked, by instincts and greed, of the Empire of Valve. 

The Valve community was at peace with this once great nation, and at the solicitation of Valve, the promise of the introduction of Half-Life 3 and the promise for a great, prosperous community. Indeed, 9 days after the release of Artifact, the game's reception has received Mixed reviews and a score of 77% by Metacritic. The game had lost half of it's playerbase within a week and the numbers were plunging consecutively. While this playerbase criticism was still on the rise within the ""Artifact"" community, Valve did not give out a direct response.

It will be recorded that the Battle Royale trend and Valve's indirect cohesion within it's community makes it obvious that the trend continues to fuel our Lord and Savior ""Gaben"" with greed and instinct. This trend may have been planned for weeks or even months. During the intervening time, Valve Software has deceived us with the hopes of giving the things we desire most from our Lord and Savior, with the abandonment of the Half Life campaign and it's writers.

The trend 2 days ago has been widely received as negative and ""F2P"" and a deliberate ""waste of money"" to CSGO community. A that day, they have given us the pointless ""Prime Status"" to ""Honor"" those who have played for thousands of hours. Clearly, it was an indirect apology made by developers themselves.

Valve, has undertaken a deceitful advantage over it's playerbase extending throughout Steam. The facts from 2 days ago and the days to come speak for themselves. The People of Steam have formed have already formed their opinions and well understand the implications to the trends and cringe that will affect our great community.

As a common speaker of the CSGO community, I have suggested to prepare your anus for the upcoming 9 year old invasion and prepare all global elites to take any direct measures to fight back against the coming horde. But always will the Valve community remember the deceitful lies our lord has brought us.""

when you fire your weapon on an enemy the enemy should be dead, but uh oh, the enemy has better ping than you, so you die. No big deal except the fact your weapons damage and bullets ♥♥♥♥ing VANISH INTO THIN AIR so it wasn't a fair trade, it was someone having better connection leading you to have a disadvantage.

The game is poorly made with a ♥♥♥♥ community too masked by the VALVE IS GREAT schpeal to realise ""Oh hey, this game is missing alot of stuff.""

This game causes me one negative now, I used to enjoy this game, but now this game is nothing to me, I'm going to leave it. So, back to the topic, why do I hate this game? So, I played it a lot, earned the title, but at some point I was given an automatic mute for nothing, I was never toxic to players, this function was created for toxic, that is, they threw me reports for my own game, hmm, why are they throwing reports for my skill, well, for stupidity? Mute is such a thing that disables you to all players, the players should mute you, okay, I started playing and I'm playing, they gave me a ban for 7 days for nothing, well, that is, for stupid reports, why are you adding this feature? Why do they give me reports about my game, supposedly they thought I was a fraud, I went to every game and everyone told me, ""Oh guys, there's a scam here if they cheat. ""Well, what nonsense, I was fed up with schoolchildren in this garbage game. Just why they added this feature, I do not know, it would be great to remove toxic players, but I did not offend, I just played.. I started playing again after a 7-day ban, they started giving me more than 7 days, and even then I was ahuel, don't you understand? That is, the ban can be more than 7 days? Okay, I was banned for 9, then for 11, so it came to a 14-day ban, it's just a nightmare. I created a new account, started playing there, just calibrated my rank, but the students in the game thought I was a cheater, also threw me reports, too, now I have a ban for 8 days, also mutated, and now I went into the usual, played 2 games, threw 2 reports and I returned to the ban how this system works, I already had a ban for 18 days, I played on a public server, I said they would send me reports, I would check, and yes, I was banned for 14, it seems that even then I was banned, many will say go to Faceit, yes Faceit - it's cool, but I'm used to matchmaking, to the 64th ticker, I liked scoring a lot of wins in matchmaking, in general, this is the worst game at the moment, that's all for me.

OK i wrote this because Im not Hating this game, I don't get paid, This is BASED on my experience, because there are soo much problem in CS:GO Matchmaking. Well actually I do love this game So MUCH but... Let us straight to the point. Everytime I play Matchmaking I will always found a Hacker / Smurf .Well yeah I know ''Volvo'' has tried by using TRUST FACTOR, and PRIME but please... They all are USELESS ! PLEASE FIX OMG.
          However My rank was SUPREME and everytime I play in that rank i will ALWAYS found a HACKER,even in Prime / trust factors.. Matchmaking
well now i play this game on my other account but still.. I will found hackers / smurf ( btw my 2nd account is MG 2)
Like seriously I don't feel High rank in this game is fun anymore, not like the old times..
we play and then we got rekt by hacker and smurf. Some poeple Say that Hacker pay money to ''Volvo'' for $5-$100 and if they don't use the hack blatantly They will not get ban.
          Furthermore if you want to play without HACKER / SMURF you need  to buy FACEIT / ESEA account which is NOT cheap.
And seriously ''VOLVO'' Needs to improve their game by adding new guns, new maps, new game modes, and new operation, We don't need good GRAPHICS,We don't need sound update ( which is Horrible to hear.)
          Moreover
if u watch the Old CS:GO trailer, there will be a scene that shows M4a4 has iron Sights..
WHEREE?? is this some kind of a SCAM? Plus The Game logo is showing us a CT holding a SCAR-H
WHEREEE? Please don't do some ''VOLVO'' Logic here. 
          Conclusion..
This game is fun but Please.. please please.. make ur ''VAC'' more usefull how can UNTURNED ( BATTLE EYE ) 
which is a FREE game has better Anti Cheat system?? and try to add some new Guns,Maps,Game modes, or maybe new method to get skins ( not only by using key ).Well maybe that's all from me 
Peace <3

How is this pulling off as the most played game during the holidays and the pandemic is BAFFLING! With such rampant cheating problem that has not been fixed still, people keep playing this OMEGA FUCKING LUL. I have no words honestly but hey there are missions with cosmetic rewards at the moment so why not throw money at this game, money that you will never get back and you get garbage in return in a game that has been dead for years now because of cheaters, I guess people don't care they play against cheaters.

Edit May 2020: The game still has tons of cheaters in it. On top of that there is a big chance you might get hacked if you play on community servers. The only way to enjoy it and be safe from the online bullshit is playing on a LAN with friends. My suggestions is to simply uninstall it and don't bother with it anymore.



Edit November 2019: After not playing for ages(months or perhaps even a year) I decided to try it because of the new operation. I don't know if everything I said below still stands but the hit detection is literally non-existent at the moment. It does not register my headshots properly online at all. It's impossible to play when my shots are so damn random all over the place despite me being good at aiming. On top of that after calibrating the matchmaking put me into silver ranks when I was LE before WTF?! And on top of that also I am encountering wallhackers almost every game and that's in silver ranks WTF?! How bad can all these losers be to play with hacks in silver ranks?! Because of these scumbags it will take me a lot longer to get back into my actual rank despite me top fragging every single game. THANK YOU VALVE FOR THE AMAZING ONLINE EXPERIENCE.


One would think there are no cheaters since it's official servers protected by anti-cheat system but guess again, there are cheaters. On top of that YOU get punished if you solo queued and got matched with a cheater on your team because ""reasons"".
Also Cyka blyat rush B

Update: There are hackers in 9 out of 10 games. Don't support CSGO until they decide to clean up the game from all the hackers. Which won't happen because they give money to Valve. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
Prime doesn't do anything people still cheat.
I advise you to not play the game ever again and tell your friends to never play again. If valve sees a sudden decline in their playerbase they ""may"" do something about the hackers.

Simple math to see how bad the situation is and why valve isn't doing anything.
Average 500 000 people are playing at any given time.
250 000 comp, 250 000 casual
comp average 1 hacker per game - 250 000/10=25 000games x1 players cheating = 25 000 cheaters.
casual average 2 hackers per game - 250 000/20=12 500 games x2 players cheating = 25 000 cheaters.
So you can see there is around 50 000 cheaters playing at any given time.
50 000 people will get banned and will repurchase the game - 50 000x14 euro=700 000 euro profit. If ban waves happen every 3-5 months on avarage = 3-4 times per year x 700 000 euro profit for valve=2 million euro per year from these cheaters that keep rebuying the game.
The truth is simple. This situation will NEVER change. We will get our candy asses fucked almost every game by those sad little jabronis. There are only 2 things we can do about it - ABSOLUTELY NOTHING and LIKE IT.",FALSE
958,"Its very very hard to play in free version CS:GO (game mode doesnt matter) cuz in every game are cheaters who kills you in the smoke, through corners & doors & after this saids that they are just pro players & its just a smurf account & on main they are have rank like Global, Supreme, Lem etc.

I hope Valve will pay attention to this problem soon.

So in this moment i can't recommend CS:GO to new players if they want a fair play without cheaters.

From there I thought ""I need to step up here"" And won 6 games and tied 6 games in a row. No rank up. Then maybe 20 wins 8 losses later still no rank up. Even though I get 30-40 kills every game or some, when I get 20. But they are pretty rare. And they removed so you type in your phone number in the game and you recive prime. Those days the hackers where really rare to see. Now when they made so if you want to hack you can just pay them. They are everywhere. And I mean I have 3k hours and a lot of people I meet have around 100 hours. I think CS:GO should make people with a lot of hours should meet people with a lot of hours or atleast match up people with around the same level of private rank. But instead they let 50 hour players come in spinning and getting ace every round. Pure skill? I think not.

They have so many ways to fix this.

First, take back the phone prime system instead of the pay to hack way.

Also make the same private rank match up against each other.

All CS:GO does instead is ways for people to waste money on it. I've wasted WAAY to much money on this game. They make people match up against other hackers so they will hack, get banned and buy it again, etc. etc. They only care about money and nothing about the players. Really bad company. Should start caring more about us players. The price pool in pro matches is also really low for the income they make. They make so much money for hosting pro matches and pay out 1 million dollars only. For all teams.

He will try to download some cheats which is free (i know the cheats are free couse i try to find them and net and i found them for free) and this is it.

with competitive.

There's not much space for fun like it was before and by fun I do not mean spamming in a mic and shooting at your teammates. By fun I mean just simply playing the game with the skill you have.

Nowadays you are more likely do get kicked for not knowing how to throw smoke grenades over the maps like top professional teams. So many people simply do not want to accept some of your mistake and will rush into your profile to spamm comments wishing you to delete the game or d/i\e even though they made some mistakes as well.
I am kind of suprised how many comments I got in my profile for the last month playing this game after a couple years of break.

You probably think that by avoiding playing competitive will never put you in this kind of situation but unfortunatelly even in the Casual people can blame you for being a newbie even though it's just a 10v10 so you shouldn't care about game's economy and tactics.. just simply buy p90, go rush B and die or don't and you will learn your mistakes.
And the peak of casual's stupidity is that you are likely to be kicked if you are the last one survived and the reason is - people can't just wait 20 seconds. They just want to kick the last person playing and lose so they can play again.....

Valve added this simple way to the CS:GO's competitive by just queueing and finding a bunch of stranges thinking that competitive is for everyone but it is not. Literally thousands train their aim, having stickers with their fav teams thinking that they are good and competitive players but they cannot simply communicate and would yell at anyone for making a mistake imagining theirselves as some kind of judges of the game and this is why the game is mostly unplayable.
Before CS:GO people would find a way to competitive only after spending hundreads of hours in casual and then mixes understanding if they are capable to play as a part of a team ot not.

And worth mentioning.. People would likely kick/swear at you for using shotguns and machine guns because pro players don't use them so it is unacceptable/shame.. Even in Deathmatch.

After CS:GO became f2p it just became unplayable for new players because of Prime system that works like you are more likely to not play with cheaters if you pay 15$~ or torture yourself to gain 21lvl somehow. This system literally tells about how inefficient VAC is. Embarassing..

For the past 3 years game's FPS has dropped significantly. I could run CS:GO with max grapchics settings with 100+ fps on my old PC. Now for some reason it is impossible even with a new PC. Maybe CS:GO has a lot of garbage in its code and no one bothers optimizing it..
Recently Valve added custom skins that would work on any map and.. Personally I was a huge fan of having a special terrorist/ct crew that would match maps's theme a and we wouldn't see arctic terrorist on a sunny Dust 2.. Now we can just see FBI and SAS with the rest of GIGN ct crew.. and personally for me it just ruins game's atmosphere of a war between CTs and Ts..

I spent 900hrs playing this game in 2014-15 and I had so much fun playing Casual and even Competitive but not now. It is way beyond then just toxic. 
Play competitive only with friends and prime status.. But if you just want to relax.. idk maybe community server would help. Good luck.",FALSE

You buy the game, start playing with friends and begin to go towards competition brackets and start working on call outs and spray patterns. You genuinely begin to try. You're friend gets banned for hacking, you are concerned. He was the lowest player on every round but yet he was banned for hacking.
You get into another match and instantly headshot not once but the whole match in comp. You go 0 / 15 due to a spin botter.

This is a problem Valve Anti Cheat is terrible. Battleye needs to go into place. 
Do something or this game will die.
At least on CS:Source you could admin your servers and kick / ban the hackers.

But here you cant do anything, you just have to ride out 15 matchs of getting trash talked, if you leave you get a comp ban for X amount of time, which only increases.

So long story short.
The Victims of Hacking stay Victims of Hacking.

You have to sit the entire match getting harassed and treated poorly.
Your team is severely demoralized and everyone is trash talking everyone.
You even think about leaving the match you get a comp ban.
You lose the match you get demoted in your rating.
You surrender because someone left you get 2 losses.

Basically the game treats you like crap while the hackers get away for the most part.
and you still keep your loss and trauma from all the abuse you are crawling your way through here at CS:GO

1048,"CS:Go is a really historic game with one of the worst community, plenty of cheaters and developers who don’t care about the game. Putting the game free on steam store was a really good decision, because more people (like me) could try to play CS with no cost and as a result the popularity of the game increased farther. However, that was just a bait for VALVE to make more easy moneys. They didn’t care to develop a decent anti-cheating system but as an excuse of restricting the cheaters they decided to make new players pay 13 euros for prime status for a 10 years old game. So, if you want to play (ranked) games with less cheaters, you must pay 13 euros for prime status. That is absolutely ridiculous and proves how money-hungry is this company.
But the most annoying thing is that developers see the huge number of cheaters as the only problem of the game. Unfortunately, the community of the game is so shitty and toxic and there is no punishment for them both on ranked and normal games. VALVE is not willing to do anything about that. At that point, I would like to share with you one of my recent experiences. I got in to a competitive game with one friend of mine. We were on the same team with other three premades. They were starting kick votes for both me and my friend from the 1st round, they were constantly screaming in voice chat (of course I muted them after a while), they were throwing smokes and stun grenades in front of our faces, they even killed me in one round and they were doing what they could possibly do to prevents us from playing the game. And you wanna know what happened at the end??? I threw a molotov to the opponents ‘side, my teammates just ran into fire and I got instant kicked from the game with 30 minutes competitve cooldown, because I dealt too much damage to my teammates. After that, of course they voted to kick my premade from the game. At the end they got what they want from the beginning, they kicked us and I got punished. Good job VALVE!!! They received absolutely no punishment for their unacceptable behavior and I got banned for doing nothing. I guess that makes sense to you, very reasonable!!! And I am sure this kind of incidents happens all the time, because VALVE doesn’t care. You are right, the only problem of the game is the cheaters, there isn’t anything else to improve… 
In conclusion, stay away from that game especially if you don’t have a premade squad to play with. Please, don’t give any money to this ridiculous company, they don’t deserve neither your money nor your time. VALVE doesn’t care about improving the game experience and it shows no respect for the players regardless the prime status. SAD!!!

CS:GO has been my favourite game for a very long time, it was the game I would always come back to when im bored. However, ever since I purchased Rainbow Six Siege, Ive come to realise the flaws in CS:GO and find it extremely unplayable. Now with the new Trust Factor matchmaking system, it is almost impossible for me to find a prime match. Most people would say, 'Why not just use the Trust Factor matchmaking?', and to that I say, Fuck Off. The new Trust Factor matchmaking system has done nothing but make my CS:GO experience the worst. This is ironic because Trust Factor was described to give players the optimal competitive experience in terms on who you play with and who you go against. Ever since I started using Trust Factor matchmaking, 4/5 of my matches have been filled with hackers (only in my enemy team) and 3/5 of my games had either smurfs in the enemy team or underkilled players in my team. Ive tried to play a solo competitive game as a Gold Nova  Master and I went against a Legendary Eagle. What the actual fuck are you doing Valve??? The Trust Factor matchmaking system isnt the only problem. The gun sounds are horrible, the 64 tick servers are cancer and the biggest flaw in CS:GO is the Hit Registration. Ive sprayed a whole clip into a guy that is not moving and not a single bullet has hit him, the guy then proceeds to turn around and shoot one bullet at me while aiming at the wall and kills me. Thank you Valve for not giving a flying fuck about your game.  Every single update after Operation Wildfire has been a major fuck up in my opinion. This game is just utter rubbish now and is a waste of money to buy. It is highly not recommended and is currently the most disappointing game in my steam library.

I really hate how people neglect the times when people were fun to play with. Now people only care about how big your rank is, and how expensive your skins are. Where are the good old times?

1119,"Cs Go is the kind of game that has a great Idea, that is ruined by a handful of obnoxious and huge problems.

After roughly 800 hours, this game has descended into one of the least enjoyable experiences Valve has shipped (yes, including ricochet). 

For those who want a nice, casual experience, there is little fun to be had here. The gameplay mechanics have a too steep and confusing learning curve, such as economic management, spray patterns and counterstrafing. 

For those who want to climb the ladder of sucess and ""get good"", there is also little to be had here, with piss poor matchmaking that doesnt even put people of similar skill levels together(This is such a huge issue that third party services that cost a fee to use like ESEA and FaceIt exist), RIDICULOUSLY unbalanced weopans (a $3100 assault rifle with a spray pattern that needs to be learnt cant kill in one headshot, yet a $500 pistol with no recoil pattern can), and perhaps the most toxic community I have ever seen(Russians who aim about as well as a lobotomized hampster will get their friends to kick you from the match, often resulting in the infamously annoying ""7 day bans from online"" for ""being kicked from to many matches""), there seems to be no way of improving upon yourself and being consistently rewarded for it instead of being put with more russian autists.

Cs Go cant entertain people looking for a nice, casual online PvP game, or people who want to push themselves to their limit, and looking at how valves updating of this game has gone recently, you can even see it in the reviews. A few months ago, you would see generally light hearted, funny reviews, but after months of valve churning out a rank update which caused the first problem I noted for matchmaking, weakening its resistance against cheaters and never fixing the banning and griefing issues, Cs Go has descended into a genuiney painful experience. 

If theres one good online game to play, its probably rust. It gives consistent rewards for grinding, and doesnt include ANY of the above problems (whenever you kill someone in rust they go down and can still use their mic as they lie there and usually I get a ""aw GG dude"" or ""aw fuck well played"")

I've put in 2k+ hours into this game, played since 2014 up to 2017.
I've put ~6k+ hours across multiple accounts playing this game from 2014 up to 2019.
I am going to be revising my review, the old one will be below. (I don't know if steam will have a way to go back to the old one because I havent revised a review before.)

[NEW 2019 review]
Not much has changed from my 2017 review, actually a lot is the same.
I find the game as fun, but it's still rather alright.

I love danger zone, but that gamemode can sometimes be plagued with cheaters, depending on your trust factor.
I don't like how the game is an absolute hackfest if you don't have prime, and it's really unfortunate.
If you are going to play this game, play it with friends, otherwise you're wasting your time.
Valve's official matchmaking is good for a casual fun time, but if you're looking to get competitive, switch to a third party ASAP.

This game has had a few controversial changes, and the economy is often times impacted by Valve and their high impact decision making.
This game isn't like any other shooter out there, which is really nice, because not only is the gun play different, this game is also where you learn that people can spin at mach speeds. 

Danger Zone can sometimes be a buggy mess, and you can literally load into a match by not even clicking accept. You can derank from a 2nd placing, your rank isn't even finalized until after the match is over and someone won. (If you placed 8th, and searched for another, your rank will be adjusted mid match because the other match you got obliterated on just barely finalized.)

Scrimmage matchmaking, as far as I know, isn't truly unranked. (Who would have thought)
From the matches I've played, it just seems like the rank window is slightly bigger, so instead of going against
S2 when you're S1, you can go against an S4 or SE.

Valve Anti-Cheat is improving, but not enough to keep free to play clean.
If you want to play a cheaterless match, get prime...just kidding, if you have a low trust factor, prime does nothing.
If you have made a new account and bought prime, or are a new account and finally grinded to get prime for free, that's still not enough. 

I think there needs to be a general overhaul on matchmaking as a whole, the UI has been updated, maps have been updated, but we've been on the same ranking system with the same calculations as before. I see a lot of really bad players in really good ranks, and really good players in really bad ranks.
Elo Decay is also rather silly, just because of how many people who were high ranks can sometimes just get an absurdly low rank just for being gone for two months.

All in all, the game is probably a 5/10 or 6/10 from me, and I still can't recommend it to people, even if I wanted to.
Thank you for reading, have a good day.

[2017 review]
The game as a whole, it's alright.
High level competitive play is probably what this game has going for it.

The community, as everyone else says, is awful.
I'd much rather review the game for what it is, as well as the developers, rather than the community.

First you have the awful servers, but it could be worse, but it could be better.
Second, I don't see a problem when it really comes to skins, because that's just a secondary thing you can get if you really want to invest your money into things like that.

Third, the bugs that appear often times, or just development oversights, are quite the major killer for this game.
Had the devs been more aware for AUG, CZ, and R8 hell, we wouldn't even be talking about this tiny segment here.

People say this game is going for as much cash as it can, and I can see where they're coming from, but I don't think it really matters that skins are around.
The in-game economy matters, yes, but like I've said, that's an optional thing.

Now we can talk about VAC for hours, on how it's so bad and yada yada yada, but everyone has done that over 50 times.

Valve has overwatch for a reason, and I'm sure maybe one day (200 years from now) they'll upgrade their anti-cheat to maybe one day rival the likes of BattleEye.

There's nothing that Valve can do for their community, because their community is never pleased with what they offer.
But even with people not agreeing with things Valve push out, that's still no reason to slack.

Valve has tried nerfing weapons to make people stop complaining, may it be 50 years late, or one day later, they still respond to some calls.

They patched a no smoke exploit a day after it blew up, and sure you can make the arguement of ""but its cus they wood los money!!!!"", or ""they dont want their players to go down in numbers!!!""
That can easily be the answer, but the other answer could be is that they're trying to be more aware of problems.

Valve deserves more credit than what they actually get, am I to be honest here.

Now in terms of gameplay, this can be a long one, but I'll try not to talk about it for 5 million years, as I've already talked about some tiny segments within the game.

You have all these weapons that are available to you, Valve tries their best to make them all viable, but still, it's ruled out by M4A1/A4, AKs, and AWPs.

There's a common complaint that SMGs basically ruin the whole point of stand still shooting, which I can say, depending on your distance between you and the opponenet, if you take a stand still shot and have actual aim, you'll live.

There are a few things that ruin the gameplay experience though.
Those being

lol hacks/exploits
toxicity (which I will not go over)
development oversights

Development oversights are one of the few things I have a major issue with, as it really shows how the devs can slack, but at the same time, I do believe the CS:GO dev team is a rather small one, but I might be wrong.

Hacks and or exploits

I'd say wallers are one of the biggest issues here, because smokes aren't even a viable tool, planning is impossible, crossing from X to Y can get you killed if the hacker can actually shoot

Exploits I'd say are a close follow up due to development oversights, like the smoke removal bug that blew up for an entire day and was painful.

Like quite a few people say, they can't recommend the game, but they wish they could.
I personally wish I could, and am waiting for the day I can, but it just doesn't seem to really be getting there as fast as many hope.

Overall, I personally thing CS:GO was better in it's early days than now.
Skins are no real problem, just a side thing.
Some hacks/exploits can ruin the experience.
Development oversights are the killers of this game.
Anti Cheat isn't the best to any extent.

1150,"This should be interesting.

After a long -200 hours of this game (as of writing this) I'm pretty sure I have the jist of what this game is and why it 100% deserves a negitive reveiew. This is a long one, but worth the read.

CSGO, the compeitive game that strikes it big, larger then TF2 and Dota combind (probably) and thus, has this glow aura around it to someone who loves both TF2 and Dota is hard to ignore. I had to play!

Straight to RANK! Man up mode! Active! No beating around the bush, time to break out my AWP | No Skin and go to work on theses n00bs!

After playing my 10 Competive games, to remove the cooldown on future Competitive games, and to create a rank for myself (Silver 1, what a shock for someone with my hours), I wanted to keep playing, and so I did. This is were the bad things come into play.

Maybe I am to use to Dota 2 Low Prioirty for running my mouth to supports who can't buy wards, or Medics in TF2 who won't change Medi-Guns, whatever the case, I must have recived a 30 Min / 3 Hour / 24 Hour Ban (From Competitive match making) (For reasons unknown, honestly I have no idea)

This brings us to the 7 Day ban, 3 of them, back to back to back. I'm not here to defend myself, claim they're not valid and re-read this over and over saying ""I am right! Yea Wayne you tell them! for a week before I get unbanned. The point of this is the SYSTEMS ARE BROKEN.

Between hackers, toxic players (not excluding myself at times) and greifers, the game is unplayable in any serious way. You kick to many of thoses Hackers or Greifers, and you'll soon find yourself banned, for kicking to many players. Or Banned for having Grefiers stand in your fire grenades. Or maybe you just 2x Kill with AWP and hit your teammates in the head. Whatever the reason, whatever you do, you'll get punished for it.

If it was not for trading, and not being floated on such a high prioirty of advertisements and events held for CSGO Players, that I'm sure are paid to play, outside of the wins on the big screen. This game would be as bad as No Man Sky and Dr.Jeckle and Mr.Hyde.

In the last 3 Games
Hackers ~ 1 
Grefiers ~ 4
Toxic Players ~ 30

One can't be helped to be sucked down into there dark hole that is shit talking, it's not worth it.

CSGO, is one of the only games I've ever felt extreamly compeled to write a review for, a negitive one that is. 

You won't go Pro anyways, and you won't make bank trading. You'll just Gamble away your items, untill you get banned for a month or you download hacks and get Vac.

Stop it, learn from my mistake, I have over 3000 hours in Dota 2 and TF2 (each) and This 150 Hours wasted in CSGO, not to mention paying for the game, was a complete waste of my time and life.

Good luck, to you and me. I can't wait for you to see me playing this trash game when I have nothing better to do, maybe you'll be reading this review when I am! Never know.

1181,"To be honest, the adaptations of CS1.6 to CS:S to CS:GO became worse and worse. But on CS:GO it became a complete disaster. In-game purchases, unlockables, ranks: Nothing the real CS ever was about.

Anyway, I bought this game a few years ago on a LAN party and I enjoyed a few public games there with my friends. Now, my friends are playing it way more than our previous we play together-games such as Battlefield or Starcraft so I simply also began to play it again.

But here it becomes tricky: Before I can play on a non-cheating infested or full of noobs-team public server with my friends (a.k.a competitive mode) I need to become level 3. Yeah, this was a hard run, since you only can rank up very slowly in public-games but I managed this.

But then there was a new border I had to cross: I need to win 10 competitive games in order to be competitively ranked and be able to play with my friends. So I did that. But now the new major bummer: I’m only allowed to win two matches a day. WTF?

My friends told me it’s all about getting smurfs and cheaters from coming back to competitive again easily. But to be honest: A cheater simply can wait this time and doesn’t care. He will play a few games with his cheat everyday and after five days, he is back in. But for a normal player like me, I’m getting stones put in my way. Counter-Strike as it is with CS:GO is dead to me, even though I would like to play it.

1183,"UPDATE 29/12/2019: Because Steam asked to.
After almost three painstaking years since my last review, I still can't recommend the game to anyone. I'm going to keep it short this time. New, paid character skins, so you can blend in easier with your surroundings. The game is still riddled with cheaters and occasional server problems, along with visual glitches and performance issues for some. Valve's response is adding a new type of paid content, this time dangerously scratching on the surface of pay-to-win.

UPDATE 18/02/2017: New insight on the game. You can read my old review below.
Since my last review, which was posted in July last year, not much really changed. Just some 'small touches' by the devs, you know - they added sprays to the game, so now instead of having a small chance to drop a half-decent weapon skin you could sell on market for some profit you now have an even smaller one, with sprays dominating the drop table. And, yeah, they're cheap as hell. So if you wanted to profit out of this game, I wish you luck.
Other than that, they introduced skinnable gloves. So yeah, with knives being the past 'most expensive' skins in the game, now you have gloves, which are even rarer. As you can probably tell, Valve's moneygrab tactics are blooming.
They recently announced that they're working on a remake to de_dust2. Great to see they're focusing on the most important things that should be fixed, instead of wasting their time with a map revamp </sarcasm>.
What about the matchmaking? Glad you asked. Prime system doesn't do much, as people can register with throwaway phone numbers and still be queued for Prime. Which means that it doesn't help jack. If you queue without Prime, however, your chance of encountering a cheater rises up to approx. 95%. Not sure who still uses Overwatch, but that doesn't seem to help. Reporting people wields results after long periods of time, or not at all. I wouldn't be surprised if at this rate Valve partnered up with cheat providers for more profit, since hacking in this game is easier than stealing a kid's candy... and seems it still goes about unpunished.

And, almost forgot, they introduced public lobbies. For the first few weeks it was what you'd expect, random people jumping on your lobby and starting to screech autistically. Now? Hey, now you have like 7-9 bots instajoining your lobbies that you can't kick.

So, yeah. Still broken, and Valve still doesn't listen. Cause, you know. MONEY <3

ORIGINAL REVIEW: 
If you like shooters or Counter-Strike in general, do yourself a favor and play the good old 1.6 or Source. Global Offensive promised to deliver an upgraded experience of those good shooters, but, as it is universally known, they stopped at promises only. While the improved mechanics of the game and the indulging competitive mode are welcome additions, if you came for those reasons, well... you will be disappointed.
This game had a rough start, and I'm fairly sure you know the story. It wasn't too well introduced, hit near-rock bottom and then scored a 'miraculous' revival thanks to the skins update. That's when the devs really cared for the game, and tried to provide as much as they could so that the players liked it.

Sadly however, they stopped as soon as the downfall of the game was no longer imminent, as at this point it seems almost absurd to consider the game as successful as CS:GO dying out in the foreseeable future. And that's exactly why it's no longer as good - the game is plagued by hackers and smurfs, essentially destroying the pure pleasure of defeating an enemy in close quarters, scoring a faraway headshot with a pistol or winning a clutch. Surely, those feelings are quite alright - but they are buried really fast upon encountering somebody who's not abiding by the rules.
VAC is no use, devs haven't devised a way to avoid matchmaking you against a smurf, the greatly promoted Overwatch system stopped bringing relief after a while and Prime Matchmaking doesn't look promising either. 

Competitive games we all enjoy playing are now a lottery - you either get a complete one-sided slaughterfest thanks to unfair play, or finally get a room to breathe and play a single well-fought game, with a chance of somebody joking around and killing the pleasure yet again.
The icing on the cake is, as I already mentioned, the skin system. Instead of focusing more on the security so that the game is actually playable, we're getting balance patches so that the pros can feel a little different during tournaments, new cases to milk the money out of twelve year olds' parents and more useless stuff. In short... not recommended.

tl;dr: the game is STILL full of hackers, smurfs, trolls and raging kids who 'f*ck your mother'. It kills every little bit of enjoyment and at this stage, I wouldn't recommend buying it... maybe when valve drops another sale and starts caring for our enjoyment and not our money for once.",FALSE
1184,"Here you will see why I love Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, but in my review you will read about why I gave it a negative review due to some problems.

I loved Counter-Strike: Global Offensive when it came out in 2012 Counter-Strike: Global Offensive kind of felt more like Counter-Strike than Counter-Strike: Source except for the guns which fell better and still feel better to me in Counter-Strike 1. In July of 2013 or whatever when VALVe introduced crates and keys that you can purchase with real life money I started hating Counter-Strike: Global Offensive and hating VALVe for adding microtransactions to their video games. People will say it is just cosmetics you can ignore them, of course I can ignore them, point still stands I cannot open crates because I have to purchase a key which cost $2.50 dollars (USD). Also since playing Counter-Strike: Source since 2004 and Counter-Strike 1 since 2005 Counter-Strike 1 having singleplayer campaign stories, which I will never understand why VALVe never tried to port them to Counter-Strike: Source and then even into Counter-Strike: Global Offensive will always annoy me very much. I enjoy Counter-Strike 1's singleplayer campaign stories.

VALVe will you ever develop and release for sale singleplayer campaign stories for Counter-Strike: Global Offensive? If you develop ten hour singleplayer campaign stories expansion packs each that are ten hours long each, I ill purchase them for no more than $150 dollars (USD) each, which I consider the sweet spot for my budget in purchasing video games and because since the COVID-19 pandemic hit in 2020 I cannot afford to spend $60 dollars (USD) or more on video games have to budget those $10 dollars (USD) and $20 dollars (USD) in purchasing the video games that I want to purchase and play.

I cannot give Counter-Strike: Global Offensive a positive review due to these things. Even though Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is a good video game to play, just that for me Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is not as good of a video game to play that I love playing like I do Counter-Strike 1.

To add to the negatives, there are so many russians and non-competitive people playing matchmaking that forces you to rank down, despite you carrying them. All this gets worse as you can't filter out russians, people with no mic and a specific rank (you can be global and play with silvers). Rather than investing in proper development for this game, they release new skins and knives as well as worthless updates to the game (new animations and spiderman-defuse textures).

Sorry, but this game is in its current state very bad and the fact that they give you 30 minutes of a competitive cooldown for being the worst of the worst.. or kicking these trolls (yes, you get a cooldown for kicking too many people) is absolutely disgusting.

   Why would you make a BR game out of this iconic franchise is beyond me.You could have just made a second br game using source engine and put another dev team on it,insted you focused your resources on a mode that nobody asked for.
   Danger zone plays and feels like an indie battle-royale,cs mechanics feel weird and out of place in a genre like that.Also most of the time youre using SMG's ,pistols and shotguns which,in my opinion,lowers skill ceiling drastically.On top of that - map becomes boring and repetitive after a few games because it looks like its made in 2007 with first stable source build valve released.Last operation was over a year ago and all this time youve been working on this?!?!?Why?WTF...Valve always values community feedback ,for example - overwatch,reddit,forums,workshop etc. , but this time nobody asked for this,if anything, people were sceptical.So why would you,in a right state of mind,start working on something so controversial and uncharacteristic to cs as a god damn BR...
   Now about prime and CS:GO becoming f2p...Fuck valve.Cheater problem was bad as it is,but now since you can buy prime cheaters are going to ruin even more games because nothing stands in their way,and I dont even want to imagine all the casual PUB's which are gonna be unplayable.Even if you get eventually detected,you can simply make another account and continue cheating,there is completely 0 penalty for doing so.
    This company built all this hype around a terrible update.I was hoping for Matchmaking rework,introduction of seasons and rewards,something fun ,a goal for the casual players,maybe 128 tick servers or an operation because valve was working on something BIG...

Now its all gone,they are going to focus on BR  mode,update and tweak it.Because of that cs as we know will stagnate even more and eventually  perish.Thanks for spliting your dev team even more,i look forward for the next update in 2022.Thanks volvo :)

Aside from the overwhelming amount of children who still haven't gone pass drinking maternal milk, valve seems to have this odd rule that says ""There always must be one or two hackers on the opposite team of yours, otherwise, smurfs, otherwise, your game HAS TO BE is infested with trolls"", and I honestly think that maybe they should change that? Some of us like to do good and have some good fun, and I don't think hackers help balancing the odds out.

Also, the game's entire community seems to be drowning in toxic waste, or is going through the radioactive sideffects of some nuclear explosion, and maybe valve should consider actually WORKING on this issue rather than thinking of the next glove skin they should add to their ""useless items that our idiot customers will buy"" collection. I mean, toxicity IS quite a problem, and it all seems to be found in Counter Strike, and because of the ridiculously atrocious mismanagement and appetition for money, the amount of toxic mutants seems to have greatly increased. 

Now don't get me wrong, with the right team, cs can be an enjoyable game, but the excessive amount of poisonous elemtents, such as children, hackers, smurfs, and people who like to call you a noob whenever they successfully kill you for the first time since 16 deaths (and then proceeding to teabagging your virtual corpse), is making this game truly unbearable and therefore completely not worth the trouble or money. And, honestly, jumping down from a cliff and into a toxic waste filled sea might seem less toxic than this God forsaken community.

In conclusion, although having some sort of potential to it, counter strike is nothing but a pest infested game in which you can only ever enjoy yourself on rare occasions. So, just in case you want to keep your frustration under control, I suggest you stay away from this game.

This has been a huge disrespect to your loyal players and Pros who trained and bled in their seats to come to competitions and that's how you repay them.

Plus alot of accounts which were hacked or stole got prime, so the hackers can usually buy that account cheaper than in steam store, find a fake number ( for example smsreg ... etc) and have very good time with legit or rage cheat.

🔸CS:GO is still among the most played games on steam with 500,000 to 800,000 during the week with the numbers going up to 1 million in the events and weekends but I simply cannot recommend it anymore. The ranked competitive mode still holds a special place in my heart but it's infested with any kind of cheater you could possibly think of. The Game used to cost $15 back then despite being cheap, still managed to hold some cheaters and griefers away. Now you'll encounter aimbot kiddos doing consecutive headshot kills, wallhack, and b-hop script during the whole match without ever hiding them because why not. The game's F2P after all and if a VAC occurs? God bless Gaben for free steam accounts.

🔸The engine can't handle more improvements and newer updates, IT'S from 2012. it is appreciated valve caring for their games years after release but somehow every update manages to break it down. The game hogging your system resources for no reason, occasional stutters, huge performance hits, and even triggering some irrelevant Windows services taking big bites out of your bandwidth. However, these issues don't last long enough to become a burden, Valve fixes them within a day or two.

🔸Lastly, cosmetics must be limited to only a few items. Some gun skins are truly a piece of art or it's always cool to have a not-default knife to look at but Valve is overdoing it by adding Gloves, Agents/Patches (It's FPS game ffs), and ass-looking knives.

Unfortunately, there's no middle ground for reviews and I had to choose the thumb down but I'm not actually recommending against this game. I hardly doubt if any company would ever come up with a game to fill counter strike's shoes but steer clear of playing with randoms no matter if you're new or a vet trying to get back into the game, they tend to go frustratingly punishing when there's no friend around.",FALSE

Good quality servers is completely and utterly unheard of.

This will leave people to experience rage-inducing moments where they will: 
[list]
 [*] Hear the gun fire the shot.
 [*] See the sparks flying off of the helmet of their oponent, as they connect the headshot.
 [*] Feel the ecstacy of knowing that you have just made a contribution to your upcoming victory.
And this all last just about 0.5 seconds until it's all ripped away from you because you both fired at the same ""tick"" and thus your oponent was awarded the kill at random while your precious bullet counts as nothing.

1299,"TL;DR Not the same game as it was a few years ago. 

So, Counter Strike, once upon a time I enjoyed this game, a lot. It wasn't perfect, little big of lag there, some hitreg issues there, but I overlooked it because no game's perfect. 

But as time went on, the updates got more questionable, and worse. Let me break it down.

It's the 8th of December, 2015, and I awoke to Youtube Videos showing this new gun; the R8 Revolver. I was skeptical, but sure enough once I booted up my PC and launched CS:GO after updating it, there is was. Decided to try it out and joined a deathmatch server, and everyone was using this gun, nothing out of the ordinary there right?

Wrong. This revolver was so brokenly OP it completely fucked the game and here's why:
The R8 would replace the DEagle, and for $850  you got what is basically a pocket AWP, railgun, whatever. 

The R8 had a base damage of 115, same as the AWP. Not that bad right? Well you forgot to factor in the PERFECT accuracy of this gun, running, jumping, whatever. This was a laser and it outclassed every other gun in the game, meaning that almost everyone was using the damn thing, even in competitive. Lost the first round? Doesn't matter, just buy the R8 get a cheap skill on some poor chump who full bought and take his AK or M4. That didn't matter though because they nerfed the AK and M4 too, maybe the revolver was a cover-up so nobody would talk about it. Thankfully though, they reverted the changes. 

Sure, you had to hold the fire button for 1/3 of a second, but with right click, you could fan the hammer and fire instantly, and usually this wouldn't affect the accuracy of the R8 to much extent. And there was also bugs such as being able to use the right click to fire during the beginning of the round or while defusing and the abiltiy to hold right click and use the primary fire you could fire instantly and with perfect accuracy. Gee I wonder how that got through testing, oh yeah, they didn't ask the community to test it, or test it themselves, they just pushed it out the door.

Anyway enough about that awful update, because thankfully a few days later it got nerfed, but as with the CZ-75 it got nerfed into the ground and nobody uses the damn thing anymore, making me question why they even bothered adding it. 

Then the sound updates. At first it was bearable, but then they started chainging more of the sounds, to the point where none of the guns sound even remotely similar to what they once were, the SSG 08 sounds like a BB gun for christs sake! 
Literally nobody asked for these sound changes, they were fine as they were. 

And then the sprays, or ""graffiti"". People have been wanting sprays for a long time right? Well yeah, but valve have made some awful choices which include:
Making them have limited uses.
Having to pay for all of the colourful and good ones. 
Making certain sprays look like players at longer distances.
So Valve decided to monetize sprays. Okay, yeah that's perfectly reasonable. 

There was also the whole fiasco about gambling and all that jazz, which I'm glad got sorted out, because that was some shady shit. 

And of course there's still the issues such as hitreg and cheaters, but at this point I doubt they will do anything about it. 

I've said it before and I'll likely say it again, it seems Valve are determined to fuck this game, similarly to TF2, with horrible design choices and not listening to the community. Maybe they'll redeem themselves, but I have my doubts.

I want to like this game, I really do. But I cannot due to these awful updates.",FALSE

1304,"Let me start by saying that Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is fucking amazing and I hate to give it a thumbs down. The maps are good, the guns are balanced and the mechanics are top-notch, with the Operation maps looking stunning and the Active Duty maps having incredibly refined gameplay. Professional matches are a joy to watch and skins add a TF2-esque economy to the game(That is actually good). Skip to the fourth paragraph if you want to get to the negative stuff.

The main gamemode(Competitive) pits five Terrorists VS five Counter-Terrorists on a medium-sized map where the Terrorists must reach a bombsite within the time limit, set down a C4 and defend it until it detonates whereas the CT's must prevent the bomb from being planted, or failing that, defuse it. The game is played to a best of 30, with players changing sides at half-time. At the start of each half, players only start with 800$, which is only enough to buy a pistol and grenades or some body armour. Winning grants a large sum of money, as well as smaller sums for losing, getting kills and planting or defusing the bomb. Your money is used for buying weapons mostly, but armour and grenades are just as important. If you survive until the end of the round, you keep your gear which saves a large sum of money.

Guns are balanced by price, the AWP, Negev and M4A4 (4750, 5700 and 3100$ respectively) are far stronger in capable hands than the SSG 08, P90 or Galil (1700, 2350 and 2000$ respectively).There are no sights, so you can only hipfire or use a scope, which only six guns in the game have. Moving and shooting with anything that isn't an SMG(or some pistols) is going to be innacurate so you need to stand still to fire accurately. Guns also have an unique spray pattern which you will have to memorize if you want to land headshots(which do triple damage). All guns are lethal headshots against people with no helmet, and are guaranteed to kill in one or two headshots against helmeted opponents(which is why you want to buy armour). This makes it one of the most skill-based shooting mechanics I've seen in a videogame. A lot of strategy lies in deciding what to buy and when to buy it and what your team should buy. There is so much more depth to the game, but I'll stop here for the sake of review length. Which brings me to why I'm not reccomending it

The people playing it are some of the worst I've ever encountered, and as the months pass they only seem to get worse. I can only put up with so many people intentionally throwing games after losing two rounds or screaming at a teammate for making a small mistake. Smurfing and hacking is not uncommon, and these people are often the worst of the worst. Even though you can beat them, they'll grate at your team's non-existant morale with comments like ""ez noob 16-0 confirmed"" and immediately put them on full tilt. The game tests your patience: how long can you go on without flipping out. And the majority of games in official or unofficial matchmaking are like this, and it affects you in the long run unless you take week to month long breaks from playing. No game but Counter-Strike: Global Offensive has made me throw my keyboard in rage. Even friends who you think you can trust to keep their calm slowly but surely have their patience worn down and begin to obsess over victory and rank, even at the cost of fun.

Valve, if you want to save at least a tiny bit of your honour, let people who played the game prior to f2p update get a refund worth all the money the game has costed. 

Or make that♥♥♥♥♥♥BR f2p available thing, along with casual, and competitives leave to people who will buy the game (or the prime status).

this game s*ck's 
It's full of cheater's and toxic player's who just want to troll 
It's good to play for fun with 4 of you'r friend but if you all don't care about win or lose
But if it's important go play another game it's not for you
Even if you play face it there is toxic player's or guys who just want to troll you , you  need to be like level 8 or more on face it to get normal guys who want win and will do teamwork and stuff like that 
The anti cheat is trash , valve don't care about that cuz if they ban more account's , they can sell more copy of this trash game

1327,"Before I begin my rant, and believe me, this is the most imporant part: this game is poison. A vile, disgusting, wretched poison. Most of you are consumed by it, even if you don't realize it. This game is mind bogling frustrating. You are a god in one match, only to fail every shot in the next. A too large ammount of its players will lash out at you and everyone else over the simplest of mistakes. And all you'll be left with is anger and resentment. 

On with the show then!

Want to play a game with a 2bit code system any clown can cheat on? Filled with the most cancerous group of people known to Man? Looking for an RNG sh*tfest where accuracy doens't really mean much and hitboxes are awful? Would you like to be 1 tapped by some dickbag with a 300$ pistol when your 2900$ M4 needs 2 bullets, all the while he runs around you like a headless chicken? How about jumping with a sniper rifle and hitting targets? Perhaps you'd like to be mowed down by a balless smurf that can't get any higher in the ladder so he plays against people he knows he can beat like the pathetic sack of sh*t he is? Do you appreciate resources being spent on MS Paint sh*t skins for your sh*t guns? How's about some stickers and graffiti then, or maybe gun sound changes no one asked for and no one gives 2 sh*ts about? 

No? Then this isn't the game for you. Avoid this pile of steaming S H I T like the cancerous, aids ridden, super ebola plague that it is.

Edit: Apparently this pile of trash has moved on to gloves. Now you can enjoy your sh*t MS Paint guns and knives while you look at your MS Paint sh*t gloves. Truly groundbreaking work.

Edit4: So it's been made free now and, somehow, it's even worse than it was before. They added some garbage battle royal trash mode no one asked for (again) and, in the process, lord knows how, you can literally pinpoint, even with Prime turned on, who's smurfing, cheating, boosting or a combination of all of these with ease. I literally cannot fathom or, in fact, find the phrasing to properly explain how much I loathe this dumpster fire of a game. Worse than the game? Only the pieces of human filth that play it.

1330,"I dont have anything against this game itself, but the community is the real problem of this game.
On every game at least 1 kid that is insulting others, becouse he thinks hes boss.
Then Russians and Polish guys. Insulting you for not winning 1vs5 with 10 hp.
For example: I played Inferno, 1 round killed 4 enemies, next round killed 3 and 4th killed me becouse I had 20 hp and he had 100, I lost the round. Russians voted to kick me. But there was 1 normal people thatt voted no.
Then kids with knives are like: look at my knive, you dont have knife, you are noob. Probably moms bought them knives for Christmas or Birthday.
I bought Operation Wildfire. If someone had mission to kill enemies with weapons of your teammates and he asked i dropped him, but when I had that mission, I asked and no one dropped. Only some kind players dropped, but there are few of them. And when no one dropped i needed to get weapon from dead teammate.
And another thing that is bothering me, most people disagree with this, but its my opinion. This game is one of the most unrealistic FPS games out there. For example: grenade explode under someones legs, leave them 20 hp.
Recoil is like: shooting with ak, controlling spray, aiming to ground, kill enemy.
Then skin prices. Prices of skins are horrible. AWP Dragon Lore for 1,000 euro? Really? I will say ok, if this game would be Play for Free game. But 1,000 euro skin for full price game? Thats stealing money. Personaly my most expensive CS:GO item is very cheap Music Kit.
Then Overwatch and VAC Bans. For example my friend was playing normaly without cheats and then he got VAC Banned for being cheater. Maybe some kids reported him for killing them and then other kid on Overwatch said: All reported players are cheaters. And send Overwatch report and then my friend got banned.
And I almost forgot about hackers. Almost in every game is hacker. Mostly wallhackers or players with no flash. Thats another problem of this game.
Thats the end of this review. I dont recommend this game. If you like Counter-Strike series buy it, if you dont disagree with me buy it. Personaly i have better games like Red Orchestra that are in my Steam Library or games that are waiting on for me to buy them on Steam Store.",FALSE

The battle royale update is fine, making CS:GO having it's own Battle Royale game mode with unique mechanic is quite cool but one of the other update is making CS:GO players who already owns this game before the update get upgraded to Prime status.

At first, it seems like a good idea getting free Prime upgrade and such but when you think it back again, the smurfers/hackers that owns the game before this update also get ez prime upgrade. That means, when you play your regular competitive matchmaking, you'll encounter lots of hackers/smurfers than ever before which will ruin your matchmaking experience.

Not to mention for the F2P update, tons of hackers/smurfers will be there on your non-prime matchmaking. It sucking fucks if you're new to the game and wanted to improve your skills by playing competitive matchmaking without encountering any of them. By the way, you need to get rank 21 just to get prime matchmaking (like the rest of us) or... you can just pay for prime matchmaking lmao, such marketing strategy, very nice.

Now I ain't enjoying it as I did at start. My love for this game is on going on decreasing. Soon I am gonna stop playing it. Now I knew why people are playing PUBG now.

But slowly as the cod and console community moves over to pc they bring there negative and bitchy attitudes. I myself is an offender of this. But I have time on my hand to write this review because i was just in a competative match and got a 24 hour ban... We were kicking the other teams ass and the good o'l sqeuakers that were on my team decided to throw the game away at 6-12 us, so for the next 9 rounds my team took an ass pounding. This would've been my rank up game and i would be one step closer to be the best, that no one ever was. ""but wait...Two Girls One Awp...you can still rank up if you loose."" Well thats the funny thing. These little quickscoping killstreak wanting peices of shit wanted to prolong my climb to the top and thought it would be funny to fucking kick me. So now im sitting here writing this fucking review that no one but my friends will fucking see. But, I digress if you like learning to play a game dont buy this game because i swear to you the moment you get in the game some we call you a bitch ass cunt who is legit fucking trash and should kill yourself while butt fucking your dad...that is what you experience. If you somehow can get good at this game then maybe you will find a nice group of lads that can work well with you. But you will most likley be called a cunt sniffing faggot who should go back to cod because you are a faggot. This game will ruin friendships turn you into a monster. will i still play? ya but not in the next 24 fucking hours because the ban system is the most broken thing on the fucking planet.  But now you know what the core gameplay is like lets talk about the skins. Oh the skins. Beautiful skins. Marble fade karambit, dragon lore, vulcan, and all the cool knifes. wait. $1000 DOLLARS. are you fucking kidding me i could buy a new graphics card and a prossecer shit a new fucking car. Yes every good looking skin in this game is made for two types of people youtubers that are so rich they can start a bank and the little kid that steals his mommys purse. Oh and dont even think about trading your skins outside of steam because everyone and their mothers is a scammer. And i have one more thing to say about this game. about 30% of the community is female and thats a lot because 6 million plus people play cs go on a regular bases. But how much of that 30% are not egirls looking to use there body to use you about 10% most girls you will meet on cs go are the bitchiest chicks on the planet who join the game and are like ""hey guys Im a guuurl"" Shit they may asswell come in and say, ""Give me skins because i have a vagina you will never see""

If u wanna do matchmaking just make sure u have 4 more people that don't have their hands growing from аss and their brain wasn't damaged ⚠️⚠️⚠️

Pros: 

➕ Unusual weapon behavior unlike in other shooter games. Every gun has its own spray and u have to master it

➕ u can get amazing experience if u gather full team party (4 more players) and play with good communication when everyone knows what to do

➕ there are some really cool legendary maps 

➕ some skins look really beautiful and make u want to play with them. And this donation system doesn't give any advantages. Only cool visuals


Cons:

➖ this game is FULL OF CHEATERS. Valve doesn't care about them at all. People r playing with cheats and not getting banned for a week lol. And this is just public cheats. So with private they can do it for years. Every vac update is useless and does nothing. We still can see spinning guys who look at the ground and kill people from 1000000km in head 🤢🤢🤢

➖ people who got boosted and dont know how to play at all 😓😓😓

➖ people who boost other people and their accounts. So you've started the game and all ranks are master guardian 1. But actually 1 of them is supreme who just plays with ""noobs"" for fun. Of course u suck cuz he alone plays far more better than the rest of his team 😱😱😱

➖ people who r noob but think that they know what to do and consider it is to be their duty to tell every teammate how they must play 🗑🗑🗑

➖ stupid screaming school kids 😬😬😬

➖ in case u dont have many friends who play it and u can't gather a team you'll have to face some magic of a random search 🔮🔮🔮
If u pressed to start random mm just pray to all gods u know may be it helps idk. But mostly ull get a team full of people who wanna f4ck ur parents and relatives and kill ur whole family

➖ awful muslim community (I'm not a racist or nazi BUT) if u get 2+ muslims in your team get ready to hear their muslim language throughout the whole game. And they will not talk to each other. They will just scream to each other. It's normal voice level for them. Of course u can go for a walk cuz they dont see that u r in a team and dont care about u at all 🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷

➖ awful Polish community which is full of hatred. They hate all kinds of people. They gonna hit u just cuz u dont know Polish lang and ruin the whole game (get ready to hear ""mаtkа kurwа ya perd0le"" 1 million times) 🇮🇩🇮🇩🇮🇩

1405,"After 1500+ hrs of Counter-Strike: Global Offensive I wanted to make a real review.

I've been playing this game for a while and got to conclusion that every uppdate that Valve gave us was a disaster. 

-Every map that Valve made has been changed over 10 times except the one community map ""Cache"".

-We got the R8 Revolver which was changed within 24 hrs.

-Instead of creating a semi-decent antivirus we got what? Over thousands and thousands of hackers. I interviewed a person that was hacking and asked him a couple of questions to resolve the reason why is he hacking.

-He told me that it took him around 2-3 months to make a cheat.
I asked him did he do such a thing before like on other games as well.

-He told me it was his 1st time making a cheat.
Didn't have anyone to help him with it than google.

-The reward system is cr*ap, 4 drops a week. You can get 2 cases and 2 skins per week.
I would stay to Counter-Strike: Global Offensive if Valve adds a in-game shop just like PlayerUnknowns BattleGrounds has.

We got the new Danger Zone and with that uppdate came the Counter-Strike: Global Offensive FREE TO PLAY!
I made a second account on steam just to see how mutch hackers are there.

I played 3 games:
1st game there were 2 cheaters.
2nd game there was 1 cheater.
3rd game was clean until we got to a score of 12-6 for us and then the enemy turned on Aimbot.

I think that it's pretty clear that Valve doesn't give a sh*t about they're game.
They don't give a sh*t about the community.

What should cs players do about that, we spend our time playing this game and spend our money funding your company yet you ain't giving a shit about us, players.

What do I have to buy more skins to get an ""Anti-Cheater DLC"", or do I have to buy your Battle Pass or how is it called. I have to pay to unlock a new thing so called premium matchmaking, unlike many others I bought the game yet i can't have it unlocked, No you say, money first, well sorry but i don't see a point investing anymore in this game.
I don't even know why I am writing this because I know I'm not the first nor the last who complains about this, every day you get so many reviews, mails, videos and photos.

SO LETS SEE HOW TO WASTE 4 YEARS OF YOUR LIFE IN CSGO

So at first you buy a game called Counter-Strike: Global Offensive
You play this game all day and all time you can put in it, you live and learn, you discover new things, you donate money on crapy pixels that dont give you S H I T. Like that i wasted 121$ on that crap(before i send 480$ on my OPSkins account) And now its all gone.
You find good people in the community servers and you make friends with them, talk to them about life and have a good time. The ""GAME""   unites you with them, you play allot of time with them, grind your way through terrible expirience of cheaters in matchmaking to Legendary Eagle Master from Master Guardian 1 and play on FACEIT, some tournaments, simple pugs and you play good, but there is always people that think that they are better than you if they use ""special programs"" to have advantage over you (P.S. its called fucking cheats). So you dont give a fuck about them, but still when you play against them your nerves just cant hold this and you become toxic to your friends. Friends think that they are legit, but after a while you see them banned. And after 1.616k hours in Counter-Strike: Global Offensive YOU get banned by overwatch for using aimbot,wallhack,bhop. Even tho you know you never cheated in this game, never had an advantage over anyone, exept having a good PC and gaming equipment, YOU lose all your skins (virtual pixels/paintkits for guns) for around 121$. Its not allot for most of Dubai Royalty cunts, but it was allot for YOU, and you feel sad that you lost it all, wasted your time for absolute nothing. And yet again, VALVE doesn't do shit for you, all they have to say is ""you got banned ya cheating prick, go create a new account and buy a new game from there"" , but do you want to do everything from the start again? NO. Do you want to deposit money on STEAM to just waste it all on skins that YOU CANT EVEN GET YOUR MONEY BACK OF IT? F U C K I N G NO. Do you want to live all that hell, from smurfs, cheaters, trolls, throwers, and complete toxic morons? NEVER AGAIN.
So this is a rant of my life on this shitty fucking game that i wasted countless hours into it and had only 161 competative wins, i got fucking banned and i dont even want to hear anything about this game, the developers dont care about the Counter-Strike: Global Offensive community, all they want is to get more money off SKINS SKINS SKINS SKINS SKINS.

1443,"This is my review of the game, I was LEM before the MM update and I am LE after so only one rank down, don't know my 'hidden rank.'

I don't recomened this game because of Valve and their choices, the Match Making is broken, poor servers leads to high ping and bad hit registration, moreover the ranking system sucks and there are way too many smurfs at lower ranks and this makes it almost impossible for people to rank up, also the ELO 'hidden rank' or so Valve say it what your real rank is so our current rank shown means nothings? We could be pottenialy LE but our actual rank is MG2 how is this far on others when they are matched against different ranks this also makes it even harder to rank up, however I do agree with the MM update to make the gmae hearder to rank up I think we need to see how the ranking system works and I want to know how many 'round points' I need to rank up, for example many complain that ""they win 7 games in a row and lose one and get deranked"" we were always told it was about howe many rounds you beat the opossing team by, but maybe it is also about MVP stars who knows? Does Valve even know? Hence why there has been many external sites for cs go MM for example ESEA, FaceIT and CEVO I would recommened ESEA but not Faceit because of the very poor server hsoting, worse than Valve server hosting on CS GO. Furthermore it seems like with ever update the game gets worse, the new operations have sucked and all the skinsd including maps are in my opinion terrible, let's start with the 'New Nuke' I hate it, I loved the old one it was my favourite map and complicated boots and stats made it a great map especially for teams and friends, the map made me watch endless videos on Youtube of wallbang spots and hiding blaces also ninja defuse spots now tthe map has none of that, it's simple and easy which  I dislike becayse of all the practise I have put into the map ruined by the new one,  however I woudl not mind this if they still included the old map as a choice in the map pool, they do not :(((((((( Also VALVE LISTEN TO THE COMMUNITY PLEASE YOU MONEY GRABBERS! 

EDIT: I forgot to mention hackers, they are very common and Vavle need a better anti-cheat. But smurfs are more common and for many a bigger problem, if you see a smurf call them a noob and tell them that they can't play their main rank. 

This game however thrustrating it might be I have had some of my best ever moments on it and found friends that haave become some really good friends. I will cotinue to play CS and will update this review when I feel it is necessary, thank you and good night! :))))",FALSE
1444,I still want to get this global elite one day,FALSE
1445,2 shots  by deage - 34 damage... fuck you gabe,FALSE
1446,As of the moment Competitive is completely broken. You will derank after a single loss regardless of the amount of wins you have and how you play. Until its fix I do not recommend it.,FALSE
1447,"Belive me when I say ""This game is great"". I spent 700+ hrs on this game, made it to legenday eagle and the more you play the worst it gets. Cheater, trolls, russians, polish ppl and mainly smurfs ruin the game. It is not even fun if you know that you are going to loose the game EVEN BEFORE THE GAME ACTUALLY STARTS. It is just not fun anymore. And trolls  -- not even worth saying.  

+ R8
The first day it was released, the most OP GUN IN CS HISTORY. Better than Awp and more deadly than nagev in Close Quarters. From pit in d2 bodyshot kill on sniper in A. 

Even after the update still ruins the game, bomb times fucked, spray accuracy broken, m4a1 not 1hs kill (3100) and 5/7 1hs kill (500).

1448,"Now before I get obliterated for not recommending this game let me just say, I have well over 1000 hours in this game and I loved nearly all of them. Easily one of the best shooters I have played. I have no regrets spending $15 for the game. That being said it is with great regret I cannot recommend this game in its current state. 
First off is the community, for lack of a better phrase, it is cancer. It feels like the Call of Duty community just migrated over  to CSGO. It's nearly impossible to get into a match without being called some profanity ten times over because you didn't do what they demanded even if what they demanded was quite possibly the worst idea out there. In casual I spend the first minute muting nearly everyone because all I can hear is the constant screaming of 12 years old just cause they can, or some guy playing shit music over his mic."" Competitive is a little more tolerable especially if you have your own team. If you que up with strangers you will usually be alright, with the excetion of that one guy who dicks around the whole match just so he can derank and smurf. 
Second are the updates Valve has made to the game, newest being the addition of the R8 revolver which was nerfed 3 days later. Certain guns are way too overpowered making most other guns essentially useless in competitive matches. For me personally it wasn't too big of a problem because I only really used the AK and M4a1s but for those who want to use other guns it's pointless as you rise up in rank. 
Over and above all the game itself is great, but the community is awful, (I realize people shit talk in these kinds of games, but this is a whole different level.) and the recent updates Valve has made are less favorable.",FALSE

Well I for one would love this game if these weren't problems:

-Matchmaking servers have low tick. Sometimes your shots can't connect for no reason, you can't bhop, and it's god damn IMPOSSIBLE to get good boosts on spots that are available on 128 tick servers
-The community is the worst... Even worse that Cod's. There's a bunch of people in the wrong rank saying you suck while they distroy you every time you spawn, there's children of about 10 running around spinbotting, and EVERY late night game, is RUSSIANS WHO CAN'T SPEAK ENGLISH.
-VAC does NOT work. You can observe hackers in the damn game who are spinbotting, aimbotting, teleporting, scripting, and it's hard to do anything that involves moving or winning.
-The ranking system makes no sense at all. You can win one game at Gold Nova 2 and rank up, then get 2 games on Gold Nova 3, and then bam. 10 wins and gold nova master and you can't rank up.
-It's really unrealistic. In real life an m4 doesn't doesn't kick 4 feet in the air. They're literally made NOT to do that. Also, you can headshot someone with a glock or ANY weapon in real life and bam, one shot kill, but in the game is takes 3 headshots with a glock to kill someone >.>

1482,"At its core CS:GO is a good game. Unfortunately this game is over saturated with problems that valve refuses to fix. In this review I will try to list a few of them.

Hackers and Smurfs: If you took League of Legends level of smurfing and Minecraft level of hacking and put them together you might get half the amount of hackers and smurfs that exist in this game. VAC bans are basically collectible badges that players who play CS:GO get to acknowledge that they know how to install cheat engine on their computer. Are you a hacker or a smurf who can't get into prime matchmaking? Well you're in luck with the swap to free to play all your accounts got into prime and you can buy prime for any of your new accounts :D 

Maps : There are only two maps Dust II and Mirage, to select another map is herecy and you will be punished by the afforementioned hordes of hackers and smurfs. 

Guns : Everyone buy the awp because its a one shot. Luck > aiming until you run into someone who is good at both then your entire team runs aimlessly down a wide open pathway while getting domed by an awp for 15 minutes. Are you a degenerate that wants to have the power of an awp but can't aim? Here buy an auto, the gun that comes with a ToS where you agree that by using this gun you might get teamkilled and will get flamed by everyone in the match who will then buy their own autos and shove them up your rear end while making you recite the geneva convention in the chat. 

There is a battle royale mode and its now free to play: we might as well have set up refugee tents for 12 yr old fortnite rejects

Crates and skins: how the fuck is this not a form of gambling? pay $2.35 for a key to open a chest 90% chance to get a random $.03 gun skin but you could have gotten a $200 knife skin if you're the luckiest man alive. At least you can name your skins for $5 so that your enemies have to watch you shoot them with the ""xX-69_IM GOOD AT THIS GAME_69-Xx"" awp. 

If you enjoy pain and wasting hours of your life on a game you will uninstall and come back to every few months this is the game for you. If not please save yourself and stay away.

I cannot recommend it because this game destroys people. It's a good game but at a terrible cost.
No, Im not some anti-gaming freak, I love games.
But truth said, this is a great game, but it will kill you inside.
Matchmaking is well made so you usually get paired with equal to average of your team.
When it's easy and you wreck havoc, it's too easy, boring, unsatisfying.
If it's challenging and hard, or you're loosing, you keep worrying about your stats, skill and rank.
You are either bored and dissatisfied or stressed and angry. Either at yourself or the rest of your team(that other happens more often).
If you live in europe, this game will only make you racist. You will hate on every person that cannot speak english or your very own language for not being able to communicate with you, or refusing to communicate with you.
Maybe at first you wont experience all that by playing casual where people usually don't care, but once you try competetive, you look at casual with disgust. 
The better you get, the more hateful towards other players you will be. You will not remember how bad you used to be, you will hate all the noobs, skrubs and casuals. You will judge people by their skins, weapons of choice and headshot ratio. Everyone you dislike will be labeled as cheater.
Where is the fun in all this, I ask? You can be proud of yourself when you win, or survive in an action where you were meant to die, but each and every accomplishment you'll get will make you crave for more, and at one point you won't feel much from winning, but you will feel a lot from losing.",FALSE

1536,"This is my review on CS:GO after playing it for 3 years. Don't get me wrong, i love this game, but this game is the most cancerous thing you will ever come by. The community is awful, Valve listens to the community 1/10 times on any given situation. Example - Player: ""We need better anti-cheat, and the servers could use some work and upgrades."" Valve - ""Whats that? You could use cases and a revolver that does the same amount as damage as a fucking AWP? Ok its on the way!"". Then they release graffiti, its a cool idea, something that was in the older games. Then get this, they make it so you can only use the graffiti 50 times so you have to pay for the graffiti again. Then Valve will take that money and buy Gaben his golden plated toilet seat he's always wanted instead of putting the money into things like 128 tick servers, and things the community actually wants. No, fuck that, Gaben needs his toilet seat. Lets get into the cheating now. VAC is so bad at catching cheaters thats it's not even funny. In my rank - DMG - my friend could not get prime so we played un-prime matchmaking. We played 10 games, and 7/10 of those games had cheaters in them. From spinbot aim-hackers to blantant wall hackers that shot me from market on Mirage through the wall by the broken wall before i even showed myself 10 times in the head and killed me. Now you could say he has an advanced gaming chair, that may be the case, but no, its just his cheats. It's almost like everyone in DMG+ just has cheats they get ready to pull out of their ass to fuck the other team over and derank them. Lets get to the community now. Lets get this straight right now, i've met good friends on this game, that i still play with today. So the community is not awful, but its still shitty. From people that throw, and make you lose games, to people that just dont want to be a part of the team and think they can kill the whole enemy team by themselves and dont want to listen to anything you say, and yell at you when they die but it was their own foolish mistakes. Its probably not even worth buying this game because you will have to go through the hell of countless hours learning spray patterns, smokes, flashes, executes, you'll put countless hours in deathmatches, bot aim maps to sharpen your skill, just to go into a game to have shitty teammates that dont want to be a team, to having cheaters that will fuck you and derank you. If you want a decent experience, go use ESEA, faceit, cevo, and even those have their flaws. You have to pay monthly for ESEA, which just adds onto the $15 you paid for this game. You shouldnt have to pay monthly to get a good experience on this game, you should get it with the $15 you paid. And faceit and cevo still have the throwers, the trolls, and the cheaters, hell, even esea has all that, its just a bit more rare. All in all, if you have 4 friends to play this game with, go for it, it could be a good experience for you. But i'd just suggest that you use your $15 on a game you would have fun playing, and would enjoy, and not this. It's just not worth it...",FALSE

And to make it worse every game you lost you deranked 4 times. Then one of my once loyal friends I was playing with at the time Jordan Previtera, decided without my consent that he should start playing with wall hacks. We played about 20 games and I thought he was just getting really good. So I invited my other friend to come play with us Logan Foley. Then one day when we were all playing Fat retard Jordan got a VAC ban and amitted to using walls. About a couple days pass and me and my other friend Logan hadn't talked to fatass. Then we both get on one day to find that we went from MG to about Nova 1. It said you recently played matches with Fatass Previtera and you have been deranked. So pretty much I quit playing CS for a while. Until I met the greatest CS player of all time The Thunder Christ. This God was carrying me to Nova 3 when sendenly I got a VAC secure message saying I couldn't play on VAC secured servers.

Judging from the experience I had with this game, the community is the first crucial hole in it. Especially if you're a poor russian sod, who bought this game because your friend recommended you to do so. You'll be kicked from the server, just because guys from other countries thought that your drunk vodka dances wasn't good enough. That always grinds my gears.

The [b]gameplay[/b] is repetitive and there's nothing to talk about. I'm sure you've played it and know what i mean.

Since I haven't much played it lately, there seems to be new payable merch were implemented, like: gloves, something about premium-accounts and ect. 

If the game tries to show the conflict between SWAT and mujaheddins, let's first get rid of the colored guns and gloves, because on the real war you won't be using any skins to show off to your mates. Soldiers on the war don't usually do that shit, because they have an objective to destroy the enemy forces, not showing off. The whole concept of skins seems very odd and doesn't fit in a game about the war conflicts. Also, I like the phrase ""Shop for Counter-Strike: Global Offensive Merchandise"" on the Steam store page.

[b]The summary.

I can't belive I spent over 300 hours in this game. The addiction that you might get from this is worse than drug addiction. Just for god sake, don't buy it. There's plenty of games that show war conflicts, like Arma 2 for example.[/b]

Updates nobody asked for every 6 months (R8 Revolver, Gloves, trade restrictions)
Prime matchmaking is STILL IN BETA!
little to NO community outreach
These are just a few examples of things Valve is not focusing on. People have been asking for these changes for YEARS.
Valve however has the time to assemble a legal team and focus on select 3rd party websites that may or may not be doing wrong for the community, but completely looking past the core issues with the game the community is based on. 
For that reason, I refuse to support this game.

1605,"knife simulator battle royale, not worth it",FALSE
1606,"CS:GO is unique from other shooters with its themes, gamemodes, gunplay and very high skill ceiling. It's for sure a well-made game with lot of thought put into balancing, although will never be on same level of that oldschool chaotic fun that previous counter-strike games were. Despite this, I still cannot reccomend the game, and its solely because of the playerbase. Here are few reasons how and why:

1. Extreme levels of toxicity. Since CS:GO leans hard on cooperation with your teammates, it often becomes nigh unplayable and unfun when your own teammates will be some of the worst people you ever had displeasure of meeting. Unless you can find 4 or more friends to play with you, you will be forever dragged down by absolutely feral players who will constantly bark obscenities at you through voice chat.

2. Smurfs. This term stands for players who have high skill, but purposely choose to play aganist low-skill players. They do so by creating an alternative steam account and playing CSGO there. It becomes impossible to enjoy any games when you're mopped on floor by someone's who's clearly been having too much time at the hand. And it becomes impossible to learn and improve when match difficulty on your side is through the roof. Simply put, it is not fair towards beginners and Valve should crack down on this issue.

3. Cheaters. Although there are seen in every multiplayer game, what makes them particularly cancerious in CSGO is if you happen to be on wrong side of the ""trust factor"". This system attempts to filter bad players out by grouping them with each other, away from players with a better ""good boy"" score. The problem with this is that the fresh accounts are already lowly scored by the trust factor. And if you happen to drop even lower, then it's game over, literally. You will be seeing a cheater on every single match, no exagguration.

In conclussion, if you have friends who are willing to dedicate their time into CSGO, some of these problems are less likely to be present. The more the better. But expect to rub your forehead and sigh a lot when comes to sitting through a bad match. If you happen to handle anger and stress poorly, then it is best to just avoid this game, and try some previous counter-strike games that have friendlier atmosphere.",FALSE
1607,Yeah! Hackers no longer need to buy new accounts since it's free. I love hacking simultors.,FALSE
1608,just give me back my money,FALSE
1609,"wtf did they do with this battle royale thing it sucks
",FALSE
1610,"This update is absolute trash, the whole reason for prime was to separate the cheaters from the normal players, now you're are able to buy prime and the hackers will now get even more fun out of it from dedicated salty players.

I played one game of the battle royale mode and I must say that it's absolute trash, the map is small but not well fleshed out, it feels weird and rushed. The drones carrying in the things you buy is a nice touch since it then becomes a risk/reward system, because of the noise they make, the one game I played I did win, but it was not satisfying at all, I didn't get the feel of tension you get when you are in a 1v2/1v1 and you have to clutch if for your team.

This is not a well thought out review but more my thoughts on the the update and the way this game is going to be going, I fear that this free2play battle royale update is going to become a massive succes, and that the focus will end up solely on the battle royale mode, while it may be trash now so was Cs:Go when it got released and it became a great success, so we might be experiencing the death of Counter-Strike as we know it, this saddens me greatly because I've played the game since I was 8, and I've enjoyed the game for 11 years now, it has had its up and downs but I believe this might be the end.

This update was a mistake.",FALSE
1611,"While I love this game and will probably never quit playing it I simply cannot recommend it to the kind of people reading reviews to decide if they want it or not... 

Pros.. 
- Extremely balanced, maybe the most balanced game you can play. 
- Graphics are decent, they arent spectacular but they don't need to be. 
- A few different game types if casual/competitive isn't your thing + a plethora of community based game-modes/maps. 
- Gunplay and movement is fun and responsive, with a lot more depth than what you see on the surface. 
- Somewhat large amount of freedom to play how you want to play, while still fitting in the team dynamic. 
- Runs smoothly on the crappiest of machines. 
- Suka Blee@


Cons..
- The community can be toxic at times, if you make a mistake your team-mates will be more than happy to denigrate you for it until the match ends. Not playing well ? same thing...
- Matchmaking can be frustrating, particulary in competitive.. From personal experience the biggest problem is mismatched players in terms of skill levels, it is sort of rare that you have a game that isn't a stomp one way or the other. 
- Hackers/smurfs. More than half your games will have you seriously questioning just how the enemy knows where you are constantly and knows the perfect time to rush you ect, and almost every game if you check the steam profile of the players with top frags they have less than 20hrs of cs and it's their only game...

People get unwanted updates like r8 revolver, m4 nerf etc.

1700,"Good:
+ Solid competitive FPS with lots of teamwork and strategy
+ Only popular PC game that isn't MOBA garbage

Bad:
- Full of tryhards and constant shit-talking. Too many people play this game just to rank up and are incapable of having fun.
- Lots of hackers which Valve does a poor job fighting. The worst part is, the prevalance of hackers in this game gives everyone ""hacker-paranoia"" so if you get a few lucky shots you probably end up getting reported.
- The competitive ranking system sucks as it doesn't take personal performance (only team performance) into account. A person's rank is a poor indicator of their skill level because many bad players get ""boosted"" and many good players get stuck at lower ranks by repeatedly getting matched with idiots. It feels like most competitive matches pit you against either terrible players or ridiculously good players (smurfs/hackers), and whether you win or lose is luck of the draw rather than skill.
- Knowing the map layout is too crucial to winning. If you don't memorize all the bizarre callouts, and know the map layout like the back of your hand, people will think you are an idiot. The result of this is that many people end up only playing Dust 2 to avoid having to spend hundreds of hours learning map layouts.
- It's made in the goddamn Source engine, which is 12 years old, which also happens to be the average age of people who play this game.

Our tale begins in the later months of 2014 maybe even going in to 2015. I was playing Garry's Mod, when I saw my friends playing Counter-Strike: Global Offensive. They told me it was good, fun, tactical, good shooting mechanics, good servers, good community, good graphics, and EVEN BEST GAME N/A! Maybe a day after, I went to my local Walgreens and got myself a $20 Steam card. I got home, typed the code in, and......... made the worst mistake of my life. I hit the purchase button for Counter-Strike: Global Offensive and I had no idea what I was getting in to. Everything my friends said,good, fun, tactical, good shooting mechanics, good servers, good community, good graphics, were lies. After wasteing 20 sum hours of griding casual games, I was rank 3 and ready to play my first competitive match with my friends. 10 games past, I got my rank, Silver Elite Master. My friends were gold nova and we continued to play, The tale now goes dark. After 20 games, I have seen about everything, Hackers on every server, Servers sucking, Swears at me, SALT, PEPPER, SAYING I SUCK MY GRANDPA's FAT CHICKEN, DAMN I HEARD IT ALL. No shooting mechanics, no good graphics, WORST COMMUNITY EVER, horrible servers, litte to none anti cheat (literally cheaters every other match), AND SALT SALT SALT SALT!

I honestly do not know what's worse, the fact that Valve refuses to fix blatant errors (abhorrent matchmaking, ELO system, Anti-Cheat, etc.), or the fact that they instead spend time monetizing the ever loving hell out of every pore of this proverbial dead horse of a game. Weapon Skins, Character Skins, Battle Passes, they spend their time on these thing yet when I get into a competitive game there is always, and I mean always a chance that there is a hacker, regardless of rank. It should anger Valve that third party companies, such as FACEIT and ESEA are actively presenting a better version of their game, not just out of kindness, but out of pure necessity, as the competitive matchmaking is a pure, hilarious joke of a system, because Valve does absolutely nothing to combat smurfs and hackers. And even when you get past all the red tape that surrounds the actual gameplay, it is still a broken mess. You can do every single thing technically right, peek the right angles, align your crosshair perfectly, and master all the sprays, and you will still hit someone 91 in 4 and get headshotted with an XM or Deagle from 30 yards away. You can be the most zen, chill person on planet earth, but if you spend just a couple minutes in competitive CS:GO, you will more resemble a masochist than a monk.

1773,"[h1]So long, my good friend, so long... I will miss you terribly.[/h1]

Before I begin, allow me to say that I reached GNM from GN2 in one week and I was playing with MG1 players until my last game.

After a couple of years playing, I have no other choice but to hang my AK and M4 on the wall, and unistall this game that entertained me like few ever did, [b]while not recommending it to anyone[/b] at the same time.

Why is that, you may ask? Allow me to keep you busy for some of your precious time to elaborate.

Until a few years ago, this game was one of the best tactical FPS you would find out there. It was fun, rewarding, and filled the gap between casual gamers and gamers that where seeking a bigger challenge. Of course, there where the usual trolls, hackers, smurfs, flamers, but they where merely the minority. Most teammates where good people to play with and made you enjoy your time spent bombing or defending sites.

And this year, 2016, not only many celebrities died, but also the fun this game once offered.

Now, it's impossible to play competitive without a team of friends you know that can play well. And for a player like me, that enjoys a little bit of solitude now and then and testing his own powers alone by going solo, that means one thing: [spoiler]Either play always with others, or lose everything you worked for.[/spoiler]

Playing with others is not a bad thing, don't get me wrong. I already explained why I enjoy some alone time every now and then though. But playing with others means I don't get to play when I want, or reschedule other games and free times for the sake of competitive.

It turns into something like a job, full of schedules, stress, pressure and complete lack of amusement.

To top it off, the game's players can be expressed in these categories:

[list]
[*][b]Casuals[/b]: your usual, run-of-the-mill players that team up with a friend or two, or they even may go alone.

[*][b]Premades[/b]: Most CSGO players are going in as teams. But, if you are unlucky and bump to a 4 man premade team, you are screwed in most times. Your every mistake will be exploited and become a reason for your team to flame you hard, or even kick you. Very rarely premades will make you feel like an actual part of the team (and these players are worth adding to your friend list).

[*][b]Smurfs[/b]: I like to call them [strike]the best players[/strike] the [i]Bane of Global Offensive[/i]. 
[/list]

Smurfs ruined this game more than anyone. Being assigned against/with players that are, in reality, way high above your skill means you don't get to improve, you won't make any progress in rising through the ranks, and if you play against them, it's almost certain you have already lost.

Then you have cheaters that can take on entire hordes of you and your teammates alone. More fun lost.

Overwatch is not doing much to punish cheaters and despite VAC, people still cheat with, you guessed it right, [b]smurf accounts[/b]

In other words, it's pointless to try playing competitive with the player base being such a fake one this period.

Hence, I quit until one day I hear this game is getting back on the right track with fewer smurfs and cheaters. And I strongly recommend not to buy it, or at least stay as far away from competitive as possible.

1801,"The new revolver is stupid. CS:GO is a good game due to it having barely any gimmicky guns but it turns around and adds this new pistol with the holding down feature. Also (apart from burst fire) why does it now have a new two fire options gimmick. Also (from my understanding) Valve has been trying to help lower level players get into the game; I came to this conclusion with recent changes to the rankings of players and such. 
Another issue I have is the nerf that came along: The pistols were not OP in their run and gun status, so why nerf that. If valve wanted to be so anti-run-and-gun then why boost that to the SMGs in a previous update xD. Basically they have added a new overpowered pistol, but on top of that nerfed all other options. The reasons why the R8 is now overpowered is that it's high damage rate. You should not be able to one shot a player that is wearing kevlar but not with a rifle. I understand that it is a ""shotgun pistol"" as such but I believe it throws the balance of the game off. One example of this is that if you hop into any competitive game (aside from the stupid new pause feature which really has no use due to a random game of comp not being in a tournament or league) there is no economy strategy anymore. CS:GO is a tactical shooter, teambased also, but due to the R8 being too OP, teams are now choosing to force buy R8, Kevlar whenever possible. It makes the game less tense and enjoyable when you know every round you can be out gunned out of your hands even if you are 10 rounds up and they have no money. 
To conclude I believe Valve should remove the R8 from CS and forget it ever existed due to the reasons above. :trainbowbarf::trainbowbarf:

1804,"This just happened.
After a failure of the 'Jungle update' in Team Fortress 2, I decided to play a match of CS:GO again.

I start up the game and pick Dust2, obviously as if there are any other good maps left in this game. Then to my horror, I find out that the map has been remade and already now, i'm slowly getting depressed.

Okay, I choose CT and buy my M4 silenced and go B, alone... Clearly the russians have a master plan for going 5 man long A, some stayed on A site and a poor soul covered my ass from middle. But what do I know how to play this game nowadays. I'm a Medic in TF:2 who uses a hand-held-healing-device. Yeah I gotten used to the russian, their broken english and the Cyka Blyats. So I just stayed put in B (alone) and lived with it.

Then I find out the terrorists have also gotten a new design. I'm sad now. The new designs are nice and detailed though, I'll admit that.

Somehow in the next few rounds I manage to topscore by simple camp and wait. Or maybe the M4 and USP are just OP. I don't know. But what I know is, that getting 5 kills in 1 round, is pretty damn wierd for someone who just startet up the game again after a month. And no, I dont play other shooters.

Okay so here it is. Round 6 or so it's a 2v2 and both T's are in B. I by sheer luck, kill the first guy through the B doors. Clearly Wall-hack as I see the dude standing with the AWPer Hand sniper and is slowly moving to the left. I start spraying with my M4, run out of ammo, but take him out. I then switch to my USP and go up to the cracked wall and start shooting at the next guy. Since so many of my team mates were dead, I was able to hear him beforehand, aswell as landing a good few, prefire shots. Sounds people sounds. So my teammates goes through B doors and I get an assist kill.

As the 7th round or so started I see they are about to kick someone. Me. Nobody said anything. I get kicked and sat there dumb founded and decided to give my opinions on this game.

It sucks as much as it's players. Don't buy it unless you suck at this game to.
""Luck or skill, kill is kill."" Is an old prahse from the previous games, but I guess luck is not part of this game anymore. Only pure rush B and skill. 

Do note
Team Fortress 2 do not have rifles.
I play as the Medic class in TF2. Which I use a 1 bolt long range Crossbow and not the 40 rounds of syringes. So spraying and praying is not even a counter argument.
I play on a laptop which gives me 10 - 30 fps and I lag in smokes.
I haven't played this game in a month or so.
I topscored, somehow.
I lucky shot and killed a guy through the B doors. Because who needs sounds anyways when you can learn russian for a 5€ game.
I got kicked and gained no XP and got no chance of getting a Lootbox/Graffity/Skin.

i played this game entirely competitive, so my rating is mostly about competitive gameplay, also i am apologizing in advance for my english since im not a native speaker. 

well, where should is start. 

i played the game semi-professional in the algerian scene. 

i loved counter strike and as i said i played this game long, very long, but im tired of it. 
the most annyonig factor for me are the update politics, valve is making way too less progress in terms of gameplay mechanics and fixing long time problems. 
(first bullet accuracy, jump bullet accuracy, rng factor, not to mention the worst anti cheat system ever created, the jumping ssg08 - or is it a feature now?) 
instead of fixing problems which are sometimes destroying u a whole match and the whole fun experience in this game, they add senseless and annoying as f**k sounds, also adding some sprays to ""honor"" pro players, yeah, great, its a good thing they are into esport but why dont they use their time fixing these problems, obviously they are working on csgo. 

yeah i know, the cheating problem is just a money making system for valve, still it destroys the experience ingame. 

just compare csgo to blizzard with their game overwatch as example, they are nearly updating the game weekly-wise and its entirely about gameplay features, nerfing, buffing and making the game more and more playable and less buggy. 

valve needs years for these kind of updates and they are still not capable of reducing the rng factor. 

i need to admit, in terms of a competitive shooter this game is unrivalled and i think thats the major problem. 
no other fps-game is halfway as good and polarizing as csgo so valve is in no need to patch this game proper. 
i still like to watch the esports scene and the major tourneys, but playing it myself became rare for me since im raging too much about issues which have been out there for years.

1833,"Dear Community and Valve,
In the following, I will explain to you why I gave a negative rating.
First of all you have to say that this game was a lot of fun and I invested many hours, but afterwards I am very sad to have played so many hours.
Valve doesn't care about the community at all and there is little or no new content. They just try to make money and don't pay attention to the community and the longtime players. . .
The ranking system should be completely reworked, because at the moment you can't play properly anymore, because every 2 players cheats or smurfs. Furthermore, there are hardly any capable or communicative players.And if these speak they are in 90% of the cases insults or speak something Russian (probabbly insults too), which absolutely does not contribute to the match. 
What you could really use are new maps. They also removed maps from the competitive and in normal game modes that many people would play, including me. (bring the old maps back especially the old Cobblestone)
If there are any questions after this review or if you still want to buy the game I can only wish that you find out for yourself and also write such a review. But im sure that u will have the same view as me, especially if you are new to the game and with a non premium account. But cheaters und smurfs are also playing with premium so that really doesn't matter...
Since Valve won't read this and doesn't take it seriously, it's more directed at the community.
Furthermore, you should not buy keys. I'm afraid I fell for that and lost a lot of money. Maybe Valve just got me addicted to gambling though that. But I have to admit that was also my stupidity
Also did I mentioned the VAC System... well its the Anti cheat software from valve but I actually think there is no anti cheat software because the cheaters I play against won't get banned...

1840,"I can remember the days when playing this game was actually fun. Now, it simply is not. Not just in Silver league, where people either troll constantly even if you're top fragging and you're the only one actually trying, hacking or smurfing from much higher ranks.

Every game makes me angry. I play against LEM smurfs, Globals smurfs, even the good ol' Silver Elite Master smurfs who still manage to destroy everyone. I spoke with some Globals and they all decided to smurf because the game became unplayable. Too many hackers trying to be bette than everyone else. The same can be said for every other tier. It is nothing short of PATHETIC. Don't get me wrong, I learned my lesson after getting VACed a long time ago, and now I'm part of the suffering demographic of the CS:GO community. Every game I get trolled. Every game I get annihilated by players who belong in much higher tiers but still enjoy destroying the players who still need to practise giving accurate callouts. Nothing I have said so far has been hyperbolized, this is actually how the game is now.

Hackers not getting banned. Smurfs having fun wreaking havoc and trolls jumping in front of you every time you shoot so you kill them and get kicked. These low-lives even gang up on you once they know you're getting angry. Next thing you know you're being body blocked all over the place and the only thing you can do is beg for a kick. I don't even have 200 hours on this account yet and the past 20-30 have been nothing but the same puerile crap. 30 year old adults acting like babies. At least the 12 year olds, even with the squeaky voices and diametrical tempers, actually try to win. Every time I log on, I have a positive mindset and feel like both having fun and winning. Then I meet the 3 types of players I just talked about. Not to mention that after the game is over, you're glad because you get the part ways and play another game with other players that won't give you a hard time. Oh wait, no you don't. You get matched up with the very same players over and over again unless you take a 20 minute break to ensure that you truly meet other players. And the cycle continues.

This is not fun. If you already have the game, can't say anything you don't already know and agree with. 
If you're looking to buy it, don't. Go play some games that are actually worth your time. Don't think for a second you'll get the same games and players you see on the pro players' videos on youtube, because you sure as hell will not. 

This game is no longer enjoyable. I know that I am bad and that's why I'm not Gold Nova let alone Silver 3. But at least I actually try to play the game, to communicate and teach the basics to the ones that are new to this game. How many reports have I sent out for griefing? And how many have been dealt with? I'm more than confident that the answer is not a single one.

1846,"The year was 2013. We were a simple group of friends. We would spend our time playing league and other classic games. Really was a variety with us. While most of us raged, one did not. And that friend was known as Rager. An ironic name, and we all enjoyed it. Some of us would yell at the top of our lungs, but Rager was always chill and knew the different between life and games. But during that year, Rager's sweaty little hands crept to the digital sensation known as Counter Strike Global Offense (CS:GO). To this day, Counter Strike Global Offense is a... Questionable game. Some liked it, some disliked. A few of our friends have played Counter Strike Global Offense and found Counter Strike Global Offense as a good time waster when you're waiting for your parents to get home with McDonalds or Zaxbys. We never got into Counter Strike Global Offense. But our boy, Rager.... He loved the game. His scrawny little brain dived into that game and had begun to swell, not because he was getting smarter. It was swelling from anger. Despite the love we had seen from his cute chubby face, Rager didn't repel himself from the toxicity that was stored in Counter Strike Global Offense. He was only attracted to Counter Strike Global Offense. Although none of us really liked Counter Strike Global Offense, we didn't judge Rager from liking Counter Strike Global Offense. We just respected his opinion on Counter Strike Global Offense. But the year is now 2019. Counter Strike Global Offense has become way more questionable than it once was. Though Rager never strived away from Counter Strike Global Offense. He only continued to play Counter Strike Global Offense. At this point, we've grown scared from Rager's addiction to Counter Strike Global Offense.  Not only was he addicted to Counter Strike Global Offense, but he's changed from Counter Strike Global Offense. Rager's name was no longer ironic, but now the truth. Counter Strike Global Offense had turned our boy into a toxic player - And from the recent changes we've seen, we fear he'll soon become a toxic streamer. He's been trying to stream Counter Strike Global Offense recently and he's already gotten 4 views at the most. Soon he'll be at 20, and that's what I truly fear to happen. All these new faces coming to Rager's Counter Strike Global Offense stream, thinking he's a funny and brilliant gamer was was toxic from the beginning. But little did they know that he was an innocent little boy who couldn't get mad at any video game slapped in his face. I come to the page of Counter Strike Global Offense to give my honest review over Counter Strike Global Offense. I think it's a swell game. But I also think Counter Strike Global Offense is a horrifying game. Not like Dead by Daylight on Extreme graphics, while you're in your dark room while your parents aren't home. But like the Dead by Daylight that wild streamers scurried to for a new competitive game to play. Rager, if you're out there - We care for you. We've even had the thought of playing Counter Strike Global Offense by your side. But I myself couldn't bring myself to it. Because I knew I would only swell up your toxicity. We only care the most for you, and wish for you to come back one day. But now this is my message to the creators of Counter Strike Global Offense. Are you proud?",FALSE

Pluses:
- Great customisation.
- A great amount of weapons (And skins for them).
- Nice gameplay on every map. U can use every tactic u want.

Minuses:
- Owful Rank System!
For example: I won 6 Matchmakings, lost one, then won 2 more and my rank didn`t increase, but then i lost 3 matches in a row and got a rank decrease. How is it working?
- Teamates.
The Master Guardian is playing like a Silver 1 (The quastion is: How he got that rank?). But my oponents are playing great.
- VAC (Valve Anti Cheat).
In almost every match there is a cheater with wallhack. I reviewed a lot of my matches and saw 
the aiming through the walls in almost every match. In a month later, playing with hacks these people don`t have a VAC block. Why?
- Spray. 
What is going on with spraying, especially with AK-47, Galil AR, Famas, M4A4, etc., the bullets are like firework.
- Hitboxes. 
It lools like hitboxes don`t exist, the bullets are not hitting. When i`m aiming the head, the bullets fly upper or lower when i am standing still.

Conclusion: There are more minuses then pluses and as a man that has near 1 000 hours i can say that this game doesn`t worth any your cent. It gives no fan, only pain, a lot of pain. So if u have 10$, spend in on somethig better, don`t spoil your mood and time.

1871,"[b]Counter-Hack: Global Derank[/b] is a prime-label jerk simulator, which has won many awards, including (but not limited to); 'Saltiest Community', Smurfs Galore' and 'I love to hit myself in the head with a large rock'.

Among the game you'll find;
[list]
[*]Various microtransactions for digital media that you pay real money for 
[*]Cheaters
[*]Players who have created new accounts and are playing well below their skillcap to boost their pathetically small egos (most likely due to their social ineptness and failiure to converse with their opposite gender) by means of winning in a video-game
[*]Cheaters
[*]And most popular of all - Children who think they are funny trollers because they watch YouTube videos.

Counter-Hack: Global Derank provides a one-off gaming experience, leaving you confused and disorientated after a game, questioning 'why?', as you click the 'play' button, in anticipation of getting matched against anther smurf/aimbotter duo.

EDIT : 8th August 2k17 
I bought this game in 2k15  , it was the golden time for this game. But sadly it started to decline in the late 2k15. Long Story short : This game was Awesome and fun to play , but now it has : 
1) Cheaters here , cheaters there , cheaters everywhere 
2) Shit Gun sounds (Some of you might like the new sounds , but tbh , i hate them all)
3) Keeps introducing shit skin cases and other retarded guns (Revolver) instead of fixing cheaters
4) No shit given to what the community wants. (Good job Valve)
5) Server crashes 
6) Sadly i think there is no dedicated team in valve to look after this game :(

EDIT: 28th October 2022
Keeps disconnecting me from servers, VAC thinks some software is interfering with it... trash game, cant even implement an efficient system which can identify who is real legit player and who is cheating... you allow blatant cheaters to play for who knows how much time, and you are not letting a legit player play on the server because you *THINK* SOME software is interfering with VAC? you dont even mention the name of the softaware.

Top notch stuff, guns had a great feel back then, no stupid stickers or skins, no failed updates. Even the final product released a year ago was good.
Since the introducing of the skins, performance went to the drain (bear in mind the Source engine is 10 years old now), stability is a word of a past and the COD effect among newcomers is at an all-time high. This is not even remotely satisfying.

If you find 1.6 or CSS dear, DON'T SWAP! Otherwise, you will live to regret it. You'll become a twisted shadow of your former self, incapable of gaming on that proper level ever again when you go back out of frustration.

The number of cheaters and the way the support/dev team does not care about this product - makes me want to vomit.

Single queing plainly sucks, no one is friendly, most players are either Hitlers(german faggots) or Russian assholes.

This game is relatively well crafted for its time.  The positives are there, it provides an arena for developing beautiful strategies and the team play can often be a treat.  The issue that I have is not with the community, it's not with the toxicity, it isn't with something out of the developer's control.  My issue with this game is almost entirely with the lack of thought and effort put into matchmaking.  There are elo systems that work, there are ranking systems that work, this isn't one of them.  I can't bring myself to say that the matchmaking in this game is well done when the vast majority of games are one-sided.  You either absolutely stomp on your opposition, or you get stomped.  A beautifully rare game is a close and well matched game, and it being so rare is the issue here.  I LOVE when I'm against a well matched opponent, where they use their advantages and exploit their opponents weaknesses, where they adapt and build a strategy to counter the one my team is putting forward.  This happens maybe 1 in 25-50 games or so, and that's just not a great system.  This has been an issue for years and doesn't seem to be addressed well, if at all.

I love the physics system and the grenades.  I love the concept of pushing onto a site and shuffling out opposing positions with utility.  I love all of these concepts, but winning against planks or losing against elites just saps so much of the fun from the game.

You have realised that I have said 'No' to the recommendation but hear my opinion on this, I really like this game.
I got trampled few times when I started, but after months and months of playing, I started to get good at the game, climbing the rank to 'Superme', spending few minute everyday aim training and even to this day, I still train, because I like this game.

But, this is a 'review' that reflects on my experince that may play out different on your behave. The reason why I have said 'No' to this game for you is because, this game is either 'you go all the way' or 'don't waste your time'.

The game has great range of mastery, different tactic, great experince in team work and most of all, winning a rank with your friends give you amzing satisfaction. But, everyone comes to that stage where your natrual ability cant take you any further, unless you are determinded to improve and train everyday. I have seen countless of people who has talent but wont spend time to extend their limit any further. 

You may now see the big picture, will you go out of your way to improve on your ability to play this game and reach greater ranking (and I mean really put your back into it) OR do you want to play it now and then and get your face smashed open every time you go on ranking.

Of cause, you may go on and play custom game like in CSS and not play rank, but if thats the case, why did you buy this game?",FALSE

2036,"[h1]I am not happy to review this game negatively. I've been playing Counter-strike for almost 20 years now. [b]Long gone are the days of community, these are the days of random tweens who found out about CS:GO through YouTube.[/b][/h1]

Ultimately, CS:GO is the logical progression of the Counter-strike series in terms of how Valve pictures it should be, and I do not fault Valve for their viewpoint. [i]Valve had an idea for how the game should turn out, and it's turned out O.K (apart from the fact most of the best maps are gone and forgotten about (R.I.P Aztec). The engine is punchy and responsive, I have no issues with ""hit-reg"" as many complain about, however; [b]I loathe the fact Valve took a community-created game and made serious changes to core game-play to the point where CS:GO is nothing like it's predecessors.[/b][/i] That's the ultimate issue old-school fans have with games like Halo, Call of Duty and of course Counter-strike...

I could put all these game-play changes aside if it weren't for the community. The community is extremely close-minded when it comes to change. I've met so many kids literally younger than twelve who worship Dust II and only play that map despite having no history of the game or why the maps even relevant. So many players refuse to play the game as a team game. If you are trapped in Silver hell, the community will just rail on you and tell you ""just frag your way out of silver"". So many times I've gotten over 40 kills and lost games. It's literally impossible to ""frag your way out of silver"" unless you get consistent aces. [b]I'm not complaining about this because I'm silver, my highest rank is SMFC. I'm just sick of seeing players baiting team mates, throwing the bomb away for no reason, doing all kinds of weird things they only do because they see other players doing it. This game and this community is completely different from how it was 20 years ago.[/b]

As I previously stated, the community is full of toxic people, I've never met so many toxic people on any other game or platform. I remember being a kid and playing games like CoD 4 and Halo 3, and I would always give some smack talk out but I would never wish cancer upon people. The community is broken and heavily divided. 

Counter-strike: Source is where I find all the older players hanging out. [i]This is troubling and spells doom for the franchise, in fact, looking at SteamDB, we can clearly see the population peaked at 2017. Unfortunately, if companies don't go back to their old-school roots, people will continue to become less and less engaged.

I was playing Nuke, and I was secret, and my opponent was literally coming down the stairs in front of me and he didn't die. Also, bullets go through heads like if there was just a ghost and opponents don't get killed a lot of times, same goes if you shoot them in the body because sometimes you can literally see the bullet hole behind your opponent and he was the one who managed to kill you. There are maps that in my opinion should be removed from the competitive map pool because they are literally unplayable unless you know a few smokes, 64 tick servers make hit reg really annoying a lot of times, its like it is not enough we got H1Z1's hitboxes, and we get stupid skin updates every goddam time. These sounds, visuals and small weapon balancing updates are just cheap excuses to make people think that they actually care about this game because lets be honest, most of the time they mess things up in terms of balancing. VAC system is useless, we recently had a VAC wave and I still found a wallhacker smoking T spawn on Dust II and getting kills while he was inside of it with an AWP and he also had aimlock on Prime matchmaking. This community is complete trash, extremely toxic, one of the worst communities in the history of gaming in my opinion and I'm gonna be honest with you, even 12 years old on Call of Duty are more mature then 25 years old who play Counter-Strike: Global Offensive. I'm glad I bought Counter-Strike: Source which is a better game with a much better community, and to be honest, what dragged toxic people into CS:GO was skins, because you know, nowadays what matters are visuals and how rich you are and not how a game works or how good the game is. RIP this game 2012-2014. (Skins came out in 2013 but the game went downhill the year after).[/i]

[b]UPDATE:[/b] [i]The game is even worse now with the Trust Factor Update, we find more cheaters by using that feature and even while we are playing prime we also have more possibilities to find them aswell because maybe VAC isn't working properly (?) I already saw 2 of them getting banned live and many others that didn't. Also, I'm obligated to turn on prime everytime I launch CS:GO for whatever reason and I obviously forget about it because before this bad update was launched we didn't need to turn it on everytime we wanted to play.[/i]

To be honest, I can't say I have observed an increase in the amount of cheaters when playing with prime enabled and a high trust factor. There were always many cheaters in this game and there probably always will be a lot of cheaters since the developers hardly give a s**t about this fact. (Hah! I even heard some theories about them selling hacks themselves, banning some every now and then, just to sell new ones thereafter)
But turn off prime and you will see the huge amount of hackers. It is ridiculous. You won't be able to find a single game without cheaters. I dare you, create a new account and try it out, it's free... By making this game free to play they turned every non-prime game into a playground for cheaters to try out whether their new hacks work and stay undetected or not and frankly it's quite depressing to see how poor Valve's Anti-Cheat system is, because this applies to every other part of this game.",FALSE

This game got me addicted to gambling. I already played poker in casino and stuff but i never felt that i need to go back there again until now. 2. Community is so toxic that you need to completely ignore it in order to play the game. Muting everyone except people you know in real life was always needed in this game. 3. Recent ranking system update. In this update valve let people feel how bad they are. If you let somebody achieve third best rank in game it means he is good and then you just send him back somewhere between mid-ranked people just because he didnt played the game for few weeks. Its insane how valve is forcing people to play they're games in last few weeks. 4. Overwatch: Now this one is an example of BIG MISTAKE. You cant just give other player ability to perma ban you. But valve gave this ability to gold novas (7-12 years olds). I decided to do a bit of experiment: I deranked my account all the way to gold and started smurfing.

You know about the toxic community and the rampant cheaters and I'm sure you even learned the intricacies of pronouncing акус ьтялб while playing. That's however not the reason why this is a negative review. The plain reason is, this game is boring as hell.

Sure the competitiveness is good when you're in a nice outfit, guns handle nice and there is a high skill ceiling. But there is not enough variation to tickle your fancy for a long time. There used to be 'Operations' that brought some nice and refreshing maps into the pool every now and then, but the operations seem to have died a silent death the equal we haven't seen since Episode 3. So that leaves you to playing the same maps over and over again. 

Every now and then they get a face lift and sometimes they even add a previous Operation map to some insignificant map pool and that's it. The rest of the variation comes from cosmetics that you have to pay for because you only get $ 0.03 sticker drops. Every couple of months they add another insignificant type of cosmetic that used to be free in 1.6 and Source (i.e. skins and graffiti) that lack any originality. I'm sure they will add tattoos next.

Aside from matchmaking the whole game seems to be dead. Casual is just a chore. Public servers are tucked away in some dark corner of the in-game browser. What's left is the routine of grinding the same maps over and over again into unimaginable boredom. The only redeeming factor is you can sell loot for ridiculous prices on the market, but to be honest you don't even need the game for that. Thank goodness the game is free.

– Edit Dec 2019: Well spank my ass and call me Sally!

2112,"With the most recent update I kinda want to rest my case with CSGO via a review. 

The game is pretty much a basic 5v5 search and destroy game that requires practice, effort, and teamwork to succeed. However the only experience I've really gotten in the end was toxicity & some teamwork. I wouldn't take the game to serious because its a game. 

The battles are hit or miss between adrenaline filled & getting shot by a guy with a one shot weapon across the map. And although there are only a small handful of guns they could be taken with many different strategies (like sniping with a shotgun). However majority of gunfights will either consist of AK's, M4's, & AWP's. 

An occurring problem for folks is that there's an outbreak of hackers. I've had a handful of them I've went against. Rather instead of Valve fortifying there system they just made the entire ranking system premium only. Now if you want to ruin someones day it'll cost you 15.99 USD (+tax). But now the new players have to deal with the folks locked out with the pay wall. Scaring them off. 

But at this point the main focus of the game is Micro-Transactions. immediately your met with a paywall if you want to get competitive with the game. Followed by the pretty skins that Valve add whenever they need an extra bit of cash. It feels like the game is less of a game and more of a Slot Machine with a game next to it. People get urges to unbox because of streamers, people lose their money, Valve gets it all, and it cycles. 

I took a brake in March of 2021 because I felt I was getting worse at it & was devoting almost 3/4 of my day to it. Now it's uninstalled, and is left as a scar on my life for the time I wasted on something that I'm never going to use again. 

At the end would I recommend CS:GO? With a clear mind I don't think so. Although the gameplay was fun at certain times the bads stack far over the goods.

Edit: A lot of players don't realize that there's a basic tutorial at the beginning of the game (at least when I first started playing it). The person that walks you through it is by far my favorite part of the game. It's a shame that it hasn't been touched since the games release.",FALSE

ну лично по моему опыту звание ничего не решает, нет конечно если у тебя серебро 2 и ты играешь с супримом это не равная игра и в этом минус, есть много людей которые добились многого в этой игре и создают новый аккаунт. После этого проходят калибровку вместе с новичками и им не очень нарвится проигрывать более опытным и скиловым игрокам. И из этого вытикает вторая проблема этой игры слабый античит от Valve. после того как кс го стала бесплатной читеров стало слишком много и толком они нечего не теряют. И конечно странный и даже тупые обновления Valv, вспомним тот-же Revolver R8 который сначала был имбалансным а теперь его никто не берет потому что он бесполезен. И всетаки от кс сложно оторватся выходят интересные кейсы с новыми скинами и изретка нас радуют баланс паччами но в том и проблема что они выходят редко в пример поставим гта 5 там обновления регулярны хоть и не умесны но это совсем разные игры так-что на этом у меня все спасибо за внимание.

At the beginning, the game went well until 100-150 hours, but after that a tough bombing begins, I lost 3 mice on the cop.
Well, personally, in my experience, the title does not solve anything, of course, if you have silver 2 and you play with supreme this is not an equal game and this is a minus, there are many people who have achieved a lot in this game and are creating a new account. After that, they are calibrated along with the beginners and they will not really run into losing to more experienced and skillful players. And the second problem of this game sticks out of this weak anti-cheat from Valve. after cs go became free cheaters it became too much and really they don’t lose anything. And of course, strange and even stupid Valv updates, let’s recall the same Revolver R8 which at first was imbalanced and now nobody takes it because it is useless. And all the same, it’s hard to tear yourself away from the cops. Interesting cases come out with new skins and the inset we are pleased with the balance of patchchas, but the problem is that they rarely come out.

2141,"CS:GO (and any CS for that matter) is an e-sports game. It is designed for competitive gaming. So, don't look for casual evening fun in it. It requires skill building and time investment. A lot of it. So, unless you are willing to make it a crucial portion of your life and have a clan or at least few friends to form a team, avoid the MP and play with bots. Although, elite bots are better than most of the newbs on the MP anyway.

Alternatively, you can play with a positively careless mindset and ignore all the veterans, smurfs and retards dominating the on-line community. You won't be on top of the leaderbords, but you'll get your moments, sweet kills and satisfying headshots. And from time to time the match making won't suck and you'll actually get to play with players who are on the same level you are.

Apart from that, CS:GO has nice visuals, tons of maps and decent amount of game modes. The interface is nice, clean and simple, which is a pleasant change from the early CS 1.6 days. I liked the different skins of terrorists that matched the maps (e.g., bank robbers in bank and office maps, Africans in tropic maps, etc.) The voice acting is improved, as well. And the weapons have a pleasant feel and sound to them.

What isn't nice however, is that the hitboxes are smaller than the body and the head. The weapons have spray patterns. And if that wasn't bad enough, those patterns are random. So, it's not entirely a matter of aiming, but luck, as well (unless you always get headshots from the first try). I'd rather prefer Insurgency with its one shot kills. Sometimes, those sprays patterns get so ridiculous that, even if you miss with your crosshair, you still hit the target, or bullets fly around corners or you miss from 2 m distance, while having the crosshair on the enemy's head.

As to the bots, it's a mixed bag. They are challenging enough and mimic different behaviours of the human players, you'll come across in the MP, so you won't feel bored. However, on private matches, by default, they are programmed to raise their difficulty as soon as they reach the average human score. And it's not entirely balanced, because the elite bots have a pinpoint accuracy and insanely fast reaction speed. Also, they camp a lot, avoid bullets by side stepping and act as a team either by rushing agressively or camping at their spawn sites, from where they manage to snipe-kill across the map. These little things were frustrating for me and I'm sure I was not the only one. I wasn't expecting the bots to be better than human players. To make the autodifficulty more balanced you have to change the config. files, which is not a very convenient way to do it.

Nevertheless, I admit that there's an addictive element to this game. And, overall I had fun playing either offline or with my friends. 

It's hard to decide between ""Yes"" or ""No""; however, with all things considered, I can't recommend it, because, after all, this game has cheap psychology behind it. CS:GO is like crack of the gaming world. It promises you brief moments of glory, passing satisfaction for dominance over other players and sense of illusory achievement and it delivers that promise from time to time, however that comes at the cost of procrastination, rage, anger and frustration.

I've played this game for a long time and made some genuine friends in it to boot. It has it's shining moments outside of just stable gameplay. As much as I'd love to recommend this game however, I'll say this much: it needs a serious overhaul in balancing alone. If you get into the competetive side at all, especially alone, you will rarely be able to claw your way out of silver. I know people will have their own success stories, but it's more uncommon than common. 

Ever since free to play hit, hackers are rampant if you are unranked, and smurfs worse so. It makes trying to get better and rank up a uphill fight on an icy slope. Unless Valve addresses this (and they've ignored the community so far) it won't make this game any better. It's brutal.

However, the saving grace for me has always been casual. Casual is still a blast, which is how I recommend this game. Free to play casual is even still a blast.

[*]Revolver R8 - new weapon that is overpriced and absolutely useless compared to deagle

[*]Wildfire operation maps - All maps in wildfire operation were running only on 1/2 fps, and sometimes with no reason you started to lag

[*]XP rewards - You bought operations to get some cool skins / money from them, that is no longer true for missions in operations you will be rewarded with xp(with enought xp you will get coin to display in game) => you have no motivation to play missions, xp can be awarded by playing competitive mod and it is much faster

[*]New sounds - new sounds were added, i hate them and many people will agree with me, most of them are terible and some are with unbalanced volume like m4 that is extremly loud

This seems to be a very unpopular opinion, but the game feels very unfinished to me compared to other shooters on the market.  The lack of ironsights is touted as a feature of this game, but I view it as a flaw.  Valve seemed to meet people half way by giving a few weapons 1x optics, but those optics feel disconnected from the weapon.  

For instance, in every FPS, when you are moving, your gun is moving around and you're going to be less accurate than normal.  That's fine.  But in all those other FPS's, your sight picture moves all over when you're walking, along with your barrel.  In CS, your scope appears steady and your bullets land all over.  Not including a walking animation for when you're zoomed in feels lazy on Valve's part.  All of the guns come ""as-is"", you will find no foregrips, ammo types, or optics you can customize.  But you do get access to special skins that for some reason are very valuable.  But again, I'm told these are [i]features[/i] of Counter-Strike, not flaws.

The maps feel very basic and one dimensional.  There's no weather effects, everything appears blocky and squared off, and none of the environments feel ""lived in.""  Compared to now 10+ year old America's Army 2, which had maps that looked and felt like real places around the globe, Counter-Strike maps look, sound, and feel like a videogame.  Again, maybe this is a feature to compete with arena shooters (like Quake or Unreal), so I'll let that one slide.  

Graphically, apart from the maps, the visuals aren't exactly bad but they aren't good either.  Textures are fairly low-res, models are passable, but nothing stands out as being special.  Insurgency, for instance, runs on the same engine as CSGO and feels much more modern in terms of visuals, sounds, and customizability.  So the capability in the engine is there, but just not taken advantage of for one reason or another.

I can't speak to the competitive scene, but if you aren't a competitive person I'd pass on this one for the above reasons.  If you are a competitive person, maybe you can put up with some shortcomings to play the most popular and competitive game for PC.

[h1]Nov 3 2016: A Second Look[/h1]
On the advice of some friends, I decided to give this game another go.  I played some more ranked games, and while I can take a step back and maybe understand some of the reasons the game is the way that it is, I generally am left with the same concerns.

[b]I think that the blocky and squared off maps without any of those weather effects is a conscious design decision and at this point maybe I can even go as far as to agree with it.[/b]  
Going back in time, the major competitive FPS's of the past were Quake and Unreal.  Their maps weren't meant to feel lived in or anything like that, they were meant to be spaces where two teams could compete in a mostly fair environment.  We never hear about Quake or Unreal Tournament anymore because... CSGO is now the de facto standard for competitive FPS.

The other reason I see it working well for this game is because this game is primarily a competitive shooter.  Sure, it has casual modes and stuff, but it's clear that the game is intended to be played in a competitive setting and that's where it shines.  To draw a comparison again to Insurgency, the maps there are more immersive but it comes at the cost of making the maps less fair for both teams.  There, if you were to compete at a high level, you are encouraged to use configs to lower all graphical quality settings down to where the game starts to look like CSGO.  CSGO, on the other hand, largely puts everyone on a level playing field by making things look like this from the start.  For instance, in Insurgency some graphical settings like LOD can affect where leaves are drawn on a prop like a tree.  Not a big deal, right?  Well, it kinda is when it comes to highly competitive players who are skilled shooters.  If a client-side command lets one player see what another can't when looking at the same area, then that unfaily tips the scales in their favor.  The swirling sand and particle effects in Insurgency, while nice, are actually done and timed client-side also.  So sometimes there will be an instance where a slight lull in the dust cloud will allow one player to see another because the animation is being played at different times for each player.  In CSGO, there are no effects like this, so the maps are more balanced.  The game is uglier, but their target audience is looking for fair competitive gameplay - not realistic visuals and immersion.

[b]Again... competitive, competitive, competitive![/b]
Given the huge amount of players in the game, the matchmaking system works amazingly fucking well.  Even when you take into account all the players who intentionally throw matches so they can remain at a lower ranking, combined with smurf (aka secondary) accounts.  After you are assigned a rank, you'll find that the ranked games you are placed in are usually very well balanced.  Sure, you will lose very badly from time to time... but you always feel like you're in control and there's a chance of a comeback.  That has to be quite accomplishment given the huge amount of data Valve has to work with and the amount of players actively trying to thwart the ranking system.  If you play casual, you will find teams and players will [i]severely[/i] outmatch their opponents on a regular basis.  When you switch to ranked, you really see how well their algorithm works to mitigate that.  We're talking Google-level algorithm making here.  It works amazingly well.

[b]But what about the ironsights and stuff?[/b]
This is still a problem I have with the game.  I feel that they should have taken an all-or-nothing approach to sights in the game.  Either put them on snipers only, or nothing at all.  Adding a couple weapons with red dots feels like a half measure.  At this point, I think their target audience is largely players who are familiar with the franchise so we will never see ironsights on every weapon.  It's what their playerbase wants, it's what they practiced at, so that's the direction the game goes.  Adding a couple red dots to assault rifles seems to make no one happy... however I'd be lying if I said I didn't use them myself.  But I'm not really their target audience.

I'd still like to see weapon sway added to the scopes instead of blurred lines, because like I said, it feels like the optic is disconnected from the weapon.  Buuut... the goal of this game is to reward practice and have an extremely high skillcap without any hand holding, so maybe they feel that giving an accurate sight picture (even if it's swaying all over) would lower the skillcap needed to be effective with the snipers and would make them overpowered.  So, trying to look at it objectively again, maybe this is a well thought out mechanic of the game that works for their playerbase and won't work for any other shooter.  If we had pretty maps, leaning, proning, and ironsights... then sure this would be a game breaking issue.  But when you take this blurry scope mechanic and combine it with the other game design decisions, I can begin to understand why they went this route.

[h1]The final tl;dr[/h1]
If you're a competitive person who wants to test your skill in controlled environments against other players, then this is for you.  It's been around for looong time so its game mechanics are mature and refined, and has largely ironed out game-breaking bugs and hitreg issues that newer shooters sometimes suffer from.

If you are not a very competitive person and you want a realistic, immersive shooter... then look elsewhere.

The reasons that you can get kicked in competitive matches are so immature and sad that it's become a serious problem:
1.Ofc if you have the lowest score in the first 4 rounds they won't hesitate to vote kick you (even if your score is just 1 or 2 below theirs)
2.If you have the least amount of kills. Degenerates don't fucking get that, in a 5v5 match, there's always going to be someone on the bottom of the scoreboard.
3.My personal favorite, if you dont use one of the following weapons: M4, AK47, AWP chances are pretty high you're going to get voted off regardless of your score.
4.Along with these, every fuck-up in terms of losing the round for your team (failed bomb defuse, failed plant, especially if you fail a 1v1, etc etc)
Bottom line is that the community is dogshit and the only way to enjoy the game is if you have a 4 or 5-man party.Any lower than that you are gonna be paired with one of the mentioned dipshits.
The rest of the game is shit, only the competitive part can be interesting and fun so if you dont have friends who play CS GO i would recommend you to stay as far away from this piece of shit community as you possibly can.

I think I dont need to talk much about the game itself.
Unfortunately this game doesnt make me happy anymore. 

It feels like the cs cheating community is growing every day. 
Most of this cheaters dont play with any tactics and are just trash talking all the time (if they use mic).

I dont know if they are searching for hvh, but valve doesnt offer such an option for mm. 
I often ask myself, how cheaters feel after winning or loosing against players who dont cheat? 
Is this the point of playing csgo in 2020?

Maybe Hackers just want to show the broken cs go mm. I dont know whats the point.
I mean, each cheater is part of the ""broken"" CSGO MM System, and each cheater enlarges the problem. 
Everyone should be aware of that.

Actually I dont like the CS GO Ranking System, too. It suggests players the ability to categorize others by their rank. A lot of csgo players think, that a good rank automatically means, that you are a good csgo player.

There is much more needed, then just killing enemies. Being a good cover, making calls to save ur mates, talking with the team to find weak points / talk about tactics (just to mention some).

Maybe Valve should think about removing the whole ranking system. 
I play for years and it feels like the cheating community is growing every day. 
And just saying: In the past, we didnt need a ranking system!

I also always hear from Hackers: ""It's tooo easy...."". Tell me if I am wrong, but Just as an advice:
Maybe you should search for a hobby which is more demanding.


... this is my game experience",FALSE
2178,"Great game, with amazing potential. But lack of developer trancparency and rampant cheating will lead to it's downfall.

Lets start this off by saying V.A.C. is a joke... it doesn't do much other than be a meme for the community to bash on. Valve makes billions of micro transaction and yet does nothing to improve player experience by cracking down on cheaters and hackers. Every low skill competetive game is full of smurfs (players with alot of experience playing in lower level games) and or hackers. Valves overwatch program catches non cheating players who happen to have a streak of good games/plays, and fails to capture the ""closet hackers"" - or people who use hacks, but play a style that makes it seem they don't. 

""Prime Matchmaking"" failed to deliver on it's goal of seperating out cheaters/smurfs from players who wan't to play against players their skill level and have a good time. It was a good idea, worked at first, but if a player can get a program undetectable by VAC, how hard is it for them to buy Prime Ready Accounts, and get access to a phone number?

Rumors have been spreading on community forums that Valve is in the works of a ""Super VAC"" yet it's been 5 or so years since the games launch, and they yet to deliver on anything more than in game accessories (gun skins, stickers, music kits, GLOVES, pins, etc) and questionable mechanic changes. I understand they want to make money - but who is going to buy their products when no one is around because of the shakey servers and toxic/hacking community.

I'm extremely disappointed in Valve - like many others, this review will get drowned in the vastness of QQ and phony reviews. There is only one way to getting Valve to act...

Boycott all Valve microtransactions. I'm am no longer buying any more products through Counter Strike or any other valve game until they make reforms to matchmaking. When they have they revenue stream in jeopardy - only then will they listen to player/community concerns and start making changes we want/need to see.

For current players, I feel your struggle, hear your cries, and share your rage. Stop purchasing valve skins, keys, kits, pins, whatever. Stop using the community market and boycott all valve micro transactions.

For future players - hold off from playing this game, the current experience will only turn you away and make your want to quit before you have seen the small glimor of light that is the csgo community. As well, don't purchase the game unless you are ready to pay 5$ a month for a 3rd party subscrition in order to have a decent competetive experience.

2217,"Really, whats wrong with game industry nowadays? Did every art director became blind or brain damanged? Lense flares, dirty screens, unfocused blur vision, vignette (corners darkening). bad gamma with washed out colors, and other ugly, unrealistic, immersion braking, eye bleeding effects everywhere!
This crap started in Star Trek by JJ Abrams, lenseflares was ugly and was everywhere, then it was on YOUTUBE, crappy CS Source and COD video montages with Skillex brostep (some still think its a dubstep, but whatever) made by 13 years old kids with no taste and brains became popular several years ago, these vidoes was full of awfull post screen effects such as lense flares, overkill bloom, washed out colors and so... also there was ENB mods for San Andreas and Skyrim, which by default looks good, but kids loved to tweak it to extemes that makes them looks ugly and unrealistic like crap, and this thing also became popular - then it seems like game devs decided to appeal to this 13- years old gamers and started to copy all this ugliness in game.
Few of the worst example of this stupid trend is Battlefiled 3, Syndicate, Hitman Absolution, Metro Last Light, Medalf of Honor 2 2012, Crysis 2, Dead Island (no lenseflares, but really ugly bloom and vignette) and there are more, and what make it even worse - most of them 1st person (keep this in mind, this is important!).

Lets for a second think what all the 1st person games all about? Its about SEEING GAME WORLD WITH YOU OWN EYES like you see it in reality!
One of the most important aspects of 1st person games is IMMERSION and REALISM! And i dont mean that everything you see in game world should be uber realistic, i mean that WHE WAY YOU SEE anything in game world should BE REALISTiC.

Now lets talk about dirt on screen, lenseflare and other crappy effects.
Does they look realistic????? Nooooo!
They called lenselfares and camera dirt for a reason - this is reason that it only sutiable for cameras and their lenses. Camera lenses can get dirty and can show lense flares- your eyes however not camera lenses, they will never get dirty, and you will never see lenseflares. There is very little possiblity however - when your eyes are really wet and aint fully opened them and keeping them unfocused, you can see some little flares, but thats it and you dont play like blind in games, in games your eyes always open and dont even blink for a second.

Dirty cam efffect should not exist in any case in FPS games, eyes aint dirty! It could be ok in some game where char wearing helmet all the time, but yet again in rea life ditry helmet screen obstruct vision, so people tend to clean it up and remove any annoying dirty from vision. No mattter if char in game wearing helmet or not, his vision is always dirty, you cant blink (expect for Alone in Dark 2008 it the only game i remember where you can blink to clear your eyes), cant clean your helmet so its really getting annoying as more as you play.
Same about other effects, such as vignette, unrealistic colors, flares etc.

It looks bad. it looks annoying, it looks unrealistic, its impossible to see anything like this by eyes and in FPS games you play as EYES, not as camer, its not third person game with camera behind shoulders!

In some games there even more stupid thing, such as weird comic overlay in recent crappy Call o Juarez (Btw, Valve, thanks for ruining series completely, 1st 2 games was really good, 3rd was no good, 4 is just awful) and there is no in game options to turn of crap like this.

-----
No let me speak about CSGO - i was looking forward to buy this game and was thinking about is as true Dead Island 2 (not that riptide lazy done crap), but when i saw screenshots with dirty screen (dirty eyes really ?), washed out brown colors, vignette, extreme bloom and really ugly aura around everything to to unfocus blur (not sure how this effect called reminds me poorly prnted pictures or bad tv screens, where every edge has aura of 2 colors at both sides, i looks like offset of some colors was shifted\displaced and they was printed few pixels left or right wrong) - and this really turns me off from buying ths game.
I will not buy it untill this ugly post effects removed completely or if devs will confirm that where will be GFX option that will allow to turn off all ugly and unreaslitc on screen effects one by one and that there would not be prerendered cut-scenes with such effects that cant be turned off.
And there are many thousands of people who will avoid this game as well for same reason!

Please Valve, stop making your game ugly by post fx, do internet research about what people think of colorgrading, lenseflares, dirty cams, vignette and other effects like this in games - most of people hate them trying to find the way to disable that crap in games and play games with realistc colors and look, and yet you ignoring this and keep asking for troubles and forcing this ugly post fx nobody needs and almost nobody will like, expect for 13 years old ♥♥♥♥♥, but arent this game is 17+ ? Why should you care about 13 years old players if you games for 17+ age group which has better taste and not a good opinion about such effects?

The thing about this game is it soon becomes an addiction and you are no longer playing it for fun but instead playing it because you have to.

- MM based on language as-well as region
-Improved Anti-Cheat system
-Make prime harder to achieve when not purchased

If you plan on following in the footsteps of your favourite youtubers and streamers opening cases and unboxing cool expensive knives then you can think again. These cases are simply a money sink for Valve and the chances of you actually getting something good and of value out of one of these is very slim. Also since the coronavirus global pandemic valve have increased the cost of keys to open cases. Please do not waste your money on 'pretty skins'. Skins do not buy wins.

2233,"Welcome to CS:GO - an FPS game that that is fundamentally designed around team communication and co-operation. Strange, then, that it took the development team more than 8 years to implement basic communication features such as location pinging, or any form of useful voice line callouts. You might also be left scratching your head at the lack of language based matchmaking queues, considering the vast majority of CS:GO players live in Europe; a region home to a multitude of languages. And by the time you find out that there is no way at all to queue for a game based on factors such as having a mic or not, you might wonder if the devs gave any thought to any part of this game that isn't the game mechanics. Apparently they are totally unaware that the majority of players are having their game experience made significantly worse or even ruined by the die roll that is jumping into a game and meeting random players. 

CS:GO fails at step one of making a game so dependent on team co-operation good: supporting and promoting co-operation! Instead, anyone who puts any effort into being a good teammate slowly has their energy and motivation to be supportive worn down by game after game of ""Oh, all of my teammates can't understand each other because they speak different languages, and all they're capable of is screaming and insulting each other in broken English"".

CS:GO can be a great game if you have a group of friends to hop into a game with. Though, if you happen to be anyone who isn't blessed with an abundance of free time and doesn't have the opportunity to wait for four other people to organize a match, you are going to have a shit time.

This game is good, but it is the community that is so shit. Since the game is a strictly meant to be enjoyed as a multiplayer game, this means you will have to play with (or against the community), and since the community is so toxic, this makes the game a horrible experience to play unless you have a full lobby of easy-going friends.

This game is broken in so many ways, and most of it is because of the community:

- Hackers: prevalent at all matchmaking ranks and gamemodes, whether vac secured or community. These sorry fucks are the biggest problem in CSGO, and are more noticeable at higher skilled levels, since there cheats, if undetected long-enough, allow them to rank up quicker. This is major casue for the next problem, but not solely responsible for:
- Smurfs: Mostly sore losers who derank or create an alt-account to avoid a legit-challenge at their real, higher rank/ or hackers, so they can score easy wins and generally make the playing experience for lower-skilled players a living hell in mm. (and don't give this bs about smurfs helping other lower-ranked players get better, if you want to get better, train on aim-maps and community headshot-only , free-for-all deathmatch servers)
- Toxic players/Griefers: Usually a useless c**t who has a more colourful and definitive vocabulary regarding you and your family than that 12-year old on COD. Seriosuly, COD actually has a mature player-base compared to these jackasses! Rubs in every in-game failure of yours, downplays your clutches, tries to votekick you (often for no reason) , teamkills, gets you killed by the enemy by blocking you/giving away your position. *Note: they often pair up with at least one or more friends so they can't be vote-kicked by you or your friends.
- Know-it-all teammates: Most people recognise that they are not brilliant by any means (including myself), so there is no need to rub it in if someone can't clutch a 1v5 situation with 1-hp against a fully-bought team on an eco round when there is only 15 seconds left to defuse the fucking bomb! You do better then!
- Idiotic/ noobish teammates: Don't even bother getting angry at these people. I simply suggest you get some popcorn and other snacks and start enjoying spectating these people try to win (or lose (many simply throw the game)) as if it were a movie, because you will witness plenty of wtf moments from these players, though inheritantly, I don't get annoyed so much if they are simply just newbies or noobies. We all have to start somewhere.

- The supportive, nice teammate who actually tries to be useful/is actually good at the game: Friend this motherfucker, and work with him/her. These players are increasingly rare!

Other than that, valve could you patch the hitboxes and give 128 tick servers for a change instead of fucking gloves and graffiti >:(

It's so frustrating since this is suppose to be a competitive game, but really is because of its community.  I don't really think that CS:GO deserved to be treated by its players like this, but just is.

Its like playing a board game with kids. They don't wanna throw the dice, they just wanna win. So they simply grab their brick and puts it on the finishline. Then the have ""won"".

The community has to grow up and realize that there is no competitive game as long as their hacking. Its just torture for the other team witch is forced to stay in the match for an hour, if not they'll get a ban.

This is a big problem but can't be solved. If their user get ""vaced"", they'll just create a new steam account and buy CS:GO and continue their hacking spree. Valve does earn a lot of money of this and the hackers are just tearing the game apart.

2284,"After over 20 years of playing Counter Strike today is the first day without a Counter Strike game installed on my computer.

Cheating has always been a problem, but in CS:GO cheating started getting worse and worse as the years went on.

I stopped playing competitive a few years ago because it became unbearable as a solo player, and just kept going on casual for fun.

Sadly, ever since this last operation began, the cheating has become so bad that there isn't a single game without cheaters now, even in casual. Half the server will be with veteran players of the game who are well-mannered and highly skilled, while the other half will be brand new accounts with some of them being really blatant about the cheating and taunting the rest about it.

For me, CS:GO stopped being fun when being competitive (not talking about playing this for a living) was no longer worth anything.

To remedy that I sold all my skins and decided to ignore the cheaters... It worked for a while.

But now its so blatant and toxic that I feel that every second I spend in this game is a second thrown to the trash can.

2337,"While you may have fun in offline mode or some casual gameplay, and the game may be worth it to you for those reasons, I can't honestly recommend this game if you intend to play at a more serious level in competitive matches.

In competitive mode the ranking system is completely broke due to smurfs (experienced players on fresh noob accounts) and hackers. Even if you know a map fairly well and your own gameplay is consistant, you could go 20 and 5 in one match or 3 and 16 in another. There really is no way to get around better players who rebought the game when it was on sale to have a fresh account, or the susceptable actions that other players do.

It's incredibly hard to learn from your mistakes when the only thing that works is bunny-hopping and side-straffing like mad, prefiring around every corner in order to get hits counted on an opponent. While you see the blood shots from your bullets hitting the target, they often don't count as hits and once you look at the stats after the opponent you shot killed you, you can see that you did zero damage. 

The server is supposed to recognize who shot first and retroactively award the kill to that person, but often you will be in a long fire fight where multiple hits should saturate the target regaurdless of who got the jump only to find in the game and then on replay, that your crosshair was 3 feet behind the guy and none of them made contact. 

Between the easily available hacks and the dodgy server prediction, it's easy to say that the source engine is getting a little long in the tooth for a game of this nature.

I have a few complaints about the game, some of them are less important than others but my opinion still stands that i dont enjoy the game, heres why.

1: The weapon balance is very inconsistent.
As i previously stated, some pistols seem to be capable of one-shot kills, while other weapons in their ideal situations (Like shotguns) struggle to get said kills, even with above-average aiming abilities.

2: Matchmaking
In all of my games (I played i think 8-9) i consistently got matched against players with 2K+ hours in the game (And in one case got matched against a dude with 8K hours, like what the heck.) This MAY of been because my rank or MMR wasn't yet calculated or something, but im not sure.

3: Community
Don't get me wrong, i can handle banter from other players (I main medic in TF2 for gods sake, if anyone knows what verbal abuse is its me) but just because i can handle it, doesn't mean it should be as prevalent in the game, now idk if the community is just toxic or if i just got really unlucky and managed to get some bad eggs in most of my games, but if the new player experience is consistently getting kicked by higher hour players before even getting a chance to play, then i don't think you should try playing it.

Guns that have the ability to one-shot for most of the body (AWP) are highly accurate, but guns that require precice aim for headshots (SSG etc) have a significant amount of random spread making them highly unpredictable and unreliable instead of skill based.

The game also puts any moving players at a disadvantage, causing the pacing of the game to be very slow for much of the rounds.

This is by far the worst thing i have ever decided to waste my life on. I would rather have been born in the soviot bloc and addicted to krokodil, and if you dont know what that is then look it up.

This is the most terrible implementation of a first person shooter game. NOTHING works. I repeat, ABSOLUTELY NOTHING. Turn a corner? head shotted, wait in a 30 minute queue.
Spent 3 hours warming up and got yourself an insane flickshot, now youre ready for combat? Go to comp and shoot someone 30 times only for them to turn around and end you with a awp, because you were lagging.
Made some friends and built yourself a lobby? Sweet, queue together and try-hard for half a match until you realize that the opponents are in fact cheating.

To roughly break it down for you, this game is comprised of the following:
20% completely undeveloped physics and shooting mechanics - SHOOTING: AN ELEMENT OF THE BASE VERSION OF CS IS COMPLETELY BROKEN AND HAS BEEN SO SINCE LAUNCH
20% running for hours on end for little to no reason
20% garbage shooting mechanics where the only determining factor in who wins or loses is who gets lucky first
20% staring at console and teammate perspectives because youll be respawning, a LOT
20% inventory management, the only feature the update throughout seven years is colorful weapon paint and bullshit character models.

The only thing they got correct is the atmosphere, which is oversaturated and cluttery and makes you want to Left-Left-Right yourself irl. I would absolutely not recommend this to anyone, not even as a joke. I would ask for my money back if I hadnt played it for thousands of hours.

2368,"Let me write an honest review of this game. This game started out as a solid team based game, with the potential to be one of the best competitive games of all time. 

However, this game is so littered with cheaters it is actually insulting. Now, almost every single person that has played this game longer than 15 minutes will already know that, but still, most places that this topic is discussed all you get are a load of replies along the lines of ""get good"" or ""mad cuz bad"".

The problem with this game besides its absolutely toxic community is quite simply, Valve.

Instead of using their time and money on improving the game with better anti cheat (or simply an anti cheat that actually works at all in the first place) they spend time doing cosmetic and frankly non important things like changing the gloves and the gun sounds. Whilst these are a nice touch, get your priorities straight.

Instead of improving their servers (64 tick, really Valve, really?) they turn the game into a micro transaction filled money making machine by charging absolutely unbelievably high prices for keys to open cases and get nothing of any value at all unless you get the luck of a lottery winner.

The money made by Valve from this game is staggering, be that original sales of the game, the silly amount of money they make for hugely over priced micro transactions, or by the huge amount of alternate accounts purchasing the game to smurf or more likely to get around a VAC ban because the anti cheat woke up and decided to work for a change. Where is this money going? Valve are clearly not putting this money into improving the game, the awful anti cheat, or anything else aimed at making the game a better game. Instead they focus solely on making this game as profitable as possible by spamming tournaments, skin design competitions so they can release more cases filled with work done by other people so they can make even more money by doing even less work as usual.

Simply put, this game has become aggresively terrible. When you get a legit game, it is not that bad. Yeah you will notice things like getting shot when you should have been home and dry because of the poor tick rate, but still, at least you feel like your input to the game has some effect. When you are playing cheaters every game though, it is an absolute rage inducing waste of time and money. It is absolutely no coincidence that most streamers spend more time opening cases and gambling illegally than actually playing this game, as most of them do nothing but echo everything i am saying here.

what this game needs to do is fix issues with their new and improved ""prime"" matchmaking, this solution was supposed to weed out all the cheaters and the smurfs of the game, it has not dont that at all, infact i find more people cheating and smurfing in prime M/M than i do in normal M/M.

I've been trying faceit and ESEA but they're quiet, it's surely not right with the money customers put into CS:GO that it should even have to be considered? 
Even with a high trust factor... cheaters, cheaters everywhere! 
While that's going on a close friend I game with gets VAC'd but wasn't cheating, can't make any sense of it and customer support have just blanked us.
I rarely get a match now without wall hackers, hundreds of hours gaining ranks... taken by hackers in 6 matches.
I invested way too much money into skins I don't get to enjoy, I only worry I get VAC'd with no good reason and loose them all.
And don't gamble kids!
CS:GO is one of the best games ever... When you get a proper game, it just doesn't happen too often.
I can't recommend anyone actually get into the game and the skins scene, you'll just end up sad and frustrated. 
I can only recommend the game for casual play with friends (be a full 5 in comp or don't bother)

Thanks for taking the one thing that us competitive players had (prime) and giving it to any and all players for free. I've recently been playing Faceit, it's better, obviously. But we shouldn't require a third party app to help us get back into competitive games without cheaters. I want to improve my in-game rank, but I've hit a HUGE plateau due to inconsistent games with closet cheaters. Improving anti-cheat and banning hardware would be the biggest fix and would welcome newer players that won't resort to cheating because other people are. Operations, new maps, models, etc WON'T bring in new players, it only satisfies the older players to keep them playing this, what is now, a cash grab for Valve.

2488,"-DISCLAIMER-(This is more of a rant but still some what of a review) I love csgo, I truly do. I spent 1000's of hours across several accounts. There is tons of amazing things about this game that make it so unique and so fun at times to play, but its getting old, and by old I'm not talking about the gameplay or the game mechanics or even the movement. Its anti-cheat is old cheap and antiquated (I find myself in so many games where I'm basically in hysteria wondering if the enemy is cheating or just flat out suffering and bored while me and my team are being absolutely destroy by blatant hackers, it is so easy to hack on this game, VAC barely does shit), VAC is so bad valve needed to implement the Overwatch system which is in ""my opinion"" the dumbest thing about this game, this game basically relies on the players to determine everything (report and ban) when valve should already have a competent Anti-cheat, oh and don't even bother with Free To Play csgo, that is literally unplayable filled with hackers everywhere, its not fun at all. Another thing is we're still stuck on the old ass source 1 engine (which is still good ig but there could be a lot more done with new and better source 2), we still have cube maps (which is the basically one of the laziest ways to make reflections), but I digress. The only way I can enjoy this game nowadays is using stuff like ESEA or FACEIT (which are both 3rd parties with way better anti-cheats and better servers), It just goes to show how lazy valve really is, always making the community do almost everything for them while they sit on their asses making tons of money, its sad. I hope this game gets better overtime and valve finally does something. Right now this game is in a bad state ""in my opinion"".",FALSE

2515,"I said I would not recommend this game. WHY? Because Valve has this weird hard on for cheaters. They allow them to cheat for months and months ruining the game, and then banning them. They claim to do this so ""they don't know what cheat got them banned."" Common sense wise, if someone is cheating, I doubt they are using multiple cheats at once. They are gonna use the first one they find.... This game could be fucking amazing if it wasn't for the cheaters.

The Valve AI Anti-Cheat engine only catches obvious cheats, like Aimbot, No Recoil, No Bullet Spread, and Spinbot/Anti-Aim. Now Valve themselves, using the information gathered from their AI Anti-Cheat, claims 2/10 players CHEAT. That is a HORRIBLE statistic. And what are they doing to fix it? NOTHING.

That statistic DOES NOT Include those using wallhacks, aka see players through walls. The AI Anti-Cheat doesn't know how to recognize a legit player from a wallhacker, its too hard for an AI to ""guess"" so they wont let it. This presents a problem, because if 2/10 use some kind of aim cheat, imagine how many more wallhack. I cannot count the times someone has prefired a corner with no information. And they go ""bro I checked and fired"" no, you turned the corner and instantly shot. AND they didn't check any other corners. The wallhackers always go ""right for you"" and only firefire the spot your in. You can change positions everyone round and they will continue to only prefire the corner you are behind. Never making a false prefire attempt. This prove they are wallhacking. There are also those that wallhack, where as you turn the corner, you are dead faster than you can recognize you saw the enemy. A lot of ""pros"" like to talk about peekers advantge, well if peekers have the advantage, how are these people getting crazy instant headshots 1 pixel after you come around the corner? The only way for that to happen is trigger bot (auto fire along with aimbot) or wallhacks. They are RUINING this game. And valve doesn't care....

SO NO, I cannot recommend this game to anyone. New players will start off without PRIME where cheating is even more rampant than in Prime. And that will turn them away, or turn them into cheaters themselves thinking everyone cheats. Its really pathetic. I remember the old days in the 90's and 00's when you would meet a cheater once a month IF THAT. Now you see at least one in every matchmaking match.... sad.",FALSE

2581,"Counter Strike: Grand Order (CSGO) is an online free-to-play role-playing mobile game, based on the Counter Strike visual novel and franchise by Turtle Rock Studio, developed by Hidden Path Entertainment and published by MyAnimeList, a subsidiary of Valve Entertainment Japan. The game is centered around turn-based combat where the player, who takes on the role of a Counter Terrorist, summons and commands powerful familiars known as ""Teammates"" to battle their enemies. The story narrative is presented in a visual novel format, and each Teammate has their own personal scenario which the player can explore. It was first released on July 29, 2015, on Android, with a subsequent release on August 12 on iOS.

STORY

In 2015, the final era where terrorism still exists, the Groupe d'intervention de la Gendarmerie nationale(GIGN), its numerous projects having guaranteed humanity's existence through to the next century, discovers that the future they have observed no longer exists, and calculates that humanity will now go extinct in 2017. It traces the cause of this event to an anomaly that has appeared in 2004 in Detroit,America. To avert the extinction of mankind, GIGN decides to use its sixth experiment, time travel, converting its agents into spirit particles and sending them through time to destroy the space-time terrorists that will cause humanity's extinction. The name of this mission: ""Grand Order"", the name for those who would rise up against human history for the sake of humans, and counter-strike fate itself.

GAMEPLAY

Counter Strike: Grand Order is a turn-based tactical RPG. The player takes the role of ""Counter Terrorist"" and commands a group of individuals called ""teammates"", who are typically historical, literary, and mythological underages from various region of Russia. The player commands a party composed of up to 4 teammates in each battle, 0 active members and 4 useless members. In each round, the player is given a grand sum of 5000 Australian Dollars and may use up to 300 of them to buy weapons. Each teammate has 5 weapons the player may use; the weapons for all the teammate on the field are randomized and bought without any order. The weapons have three types: AWP (a heavy weapon), AK-47 (a medium weapon that charges a gauge for the teammate's ""Noble Spraying""), and P90 (a light weapon that generates Rages that increase the probability of enemy's ragequit next round). If three P90 are used in one turn, they create a ""Rush"" which gives high win probability.

Teammates are obtained by summoning them through a ""matchmaking"" system that consumes Sanity, a real-life currency and Friend Points, points received by providing or using a Friend Request system. Each teammates have designated class who effectiveness in a battle depends on what class the enemies are. Another kind of loot called ""Skeens"" can be also obtained in Crates and used to give additional effects when equipped. Certain teammates and Skeens can be only obtained in limited-time only events.

RECEPTION
The game is very popular in Eastern Europe and reports indicate that the level is comparable to the success of Heroes of Might and Magic III. In South America, the game had crossed 13 million downloads by May 2018, and 14 million downloads as of August 2018. CS:GO is also gaining traction in other parts of the world such as in U.S. and Africa where it already surpassed 1 million downloads after its June 2017 Android release there. As of October 2018, the game is available in five languages across ten countries, having received a total of 32 million downloads worldwide, including over 4 million downloads for the English version.

Yeah, I report hackers when I meet them but that doesn't mean of course that the game will be free of hackers.

Let's move to the other part. Are you trying to compare players who bought this game and gave their life to it with just unknown people who never tried this game or never had idea about it (or if they played it before they played it illegally.), We really need that old special feeling that's a bad point, Loyalty Badge isn't enough totally, We need more special features as we gave all of our life to this game before, I addicted this game for 3 years and what are you doing now is totally unfair, I don't like this actually.",FALSE

Let's make it free to play and easier for cheaters to get into prime by dropping a PRIME STATUS UPGRADE FOR 19.99 instead of continuing to ban cheater's phone numbers, and making them actually have to play the game before they ruin it for others.

Also let's drop a BR mode without any sort of anti-cheat beyond VAC. Good job Valve, day you killed the game.

edit- It’s 2018, we live in a day and age when your ads are tracking and monitoring you. F* off and man up and bring back the intrusive AC. Do what ESEA does but better for f* sakes. Take control of your game. Give us what we want, 128 tick MM. Stop killing off games when you run out of ideas or don’t want to exhaust funds to make them better. This is Counterstrike we are talking about. 

Also fair play and up for debate... Announce when you’re about to drop the major AC overhaul. That way, the people who are stuck in MM cheating because they feel like they have no alternative, or have genuinely given up on the game, can finally go clean when they see the positive of a clean competitive game. Knowing that if they do it again in the new day and age of CS, they will be HWID banned. Then drop the hammer.

[list]

    [*] Extremely toxic community. Check your nerves before purchase and enter gameplay. You WILL be surrounded by a bunch of frag-hunting kids which will tell you to screw yourself over, enourmous number of AFK and abandoning players, cheaters with subtle and not-so-subtle hacks (360 noscope flickshots through wall) and such...

    [*] Casual is just a name for non-modded public servers, but official, from Valve. Contains mostly rush-only teammates on CT and T sides and is a bloody mess. No way to play casual in 5v5 format, only on your own privately hosted server in pseudo-competitive form.

    [*] MatchMaking is broken without any doubt. Prime or Trust Factor, you WILL be put in-game with teammates of 2,000h and 1h experience alike. And it is crazy. Competitive is a mess and some people getting stuck in low ranks (for them specifically) without getting a promotion FOREVER, thus leaving.

    [*] No way of filtering teammates while solo-queue. Want to play with people who understand basics of mic communications, used to simple calls and strats? Pfff! No way we are getting this. No language filters and you can get to some foreign language 4-player team, which WILL ruin most of games because of communication problems and you will be kicked.

    [*] One of teammates abandoned competitive match? Pfff! A bot will replace him! We all know how bots are good at calling info and acting on voice-chat info. Quitting punished starting at only 2h ban. Ridiculous. Not only that, but surrender system can be ruined by one silly troll who waste team time.

    [*] Overwatch system does nothing, as it seems, to abusive voice/text chat and troll-griefers. Maybe it is time to create some Patrol at all ranks to keep people in check of how they chat and play? Seen some kids in competitive who was there only to bunny-hop all around the map with 16k and no-buy, no-frag, no-drop policies. Dammit!

    [*] BONUS: Love old maps? Get out of here! Go play source or 1.6 (Condition Zero if you want bots out-of-box). No more de_aztec and de_dust after post-hydra update. Currently 2 achievements cannot be completed out-of-box install, only with workshop compatibility version workarounds.

The Problem is Valve milking their customers like cash cows. Thats not even why i dont recommend this game. The reason i cant recommend it is the cheaters in this game. On almost every second competitive match u have at least one hacker in the game. Valve still hasnt implemented a Hardware ban like th e once u see recently popping up. Their anti cheat software isnt client side at all. that means its not intrusive but it doesnt work either. There are 12 y/o kids making their own hacks in the game and Valve just implements a feature to let the community deal with it. WIthout the Hardware lock and the low price of the game, getting banned doesnt mean jack$hIt. The process of getting a player overwatch banned takes to long too. I think the reason that Valve doesnt crack down on cheaters is to make even more money from them buying the game again and again. In my opinion thats greedy af, especially when u consider the tons of money the make of the skins alone.

This is a classic old game of electronic games. I loved it and spent hundreds of dollars to enrich my game stock for it. But unfortunately, in recent years, the use of cheating has become so frequent. The game experience becomes very bad. Some players are trying to give up the game. I'm almost ready to give up the game too. So the game company is losing their customers and profits at an alarming rate. I tried to use the steam review to let the management of the game company discover the problem. The only way to solve this problem is to increase the number of employees who are monitored by VAC. This is a solemn warning note! You're ruining your company's profits and prospects. It was supposed to be a very promising game company, and hopefully it won't end up like H1Z1.I hope people who love this game give me a thumbs up and get more people to see the reviews.

This game used to be a lot of fun, but after so many updates and ""fixes"" this game has become, after already getting the ""Russian Tounge learning Simulator"" reputation, unplayable for me and my friends. After a whole month of not playing i decided to play two rounds of this GigaByte-Waster, but, my dear russian fellows, guess what I met in both of these games? Smurfs who beat the living crap out of me and my friend (He was Global before the update). And my Teammates, once again and as always, were brainless maniacs, who were incapable of holding their mouse the right way.
This comes from the bottom of my heart: Please do NOT waste your time, this game has become embarrasing and unplayable and I recommend you to play other, more innovative shooters, who deserve the hype this game has gotten over the past few years (I don't mean COD, if that is what you are thinking).

I kept deranking untill I was deep in silver, but I wasn't playing for the rank anymore, I was playing because I liked the game. I slowly realized that I was improving and after hundreds of hours I ended up on the high ranks and kept enjoying being challenged. I even created a second account just for csgo because I recommended it to most of my friends who ended up being silvers and there is no such thing as unranked 5vs5.

Edit: A few years later and I can safely say that Valve is one (if not THE) greediest company ever. Ever since Steam got big they neglected their titles and only tried to milk them as much as possible. Counter-Strike is a prime example of that.

You want new updates? How about we give you a new map every 6 months. Rather, a reworked map every 6 months. I know you like that. How about we fix none of the known bugs that are in the game for years? How about we don't develop any proper anti-cheat system and have plain and obvious hackers present in almost all of our games and even official tournaments.

How about we sell you a virtual knife for a game worth ~$9 for about $200+ that is also one of the new ""updates"" coming to the game. How about the only way we let you get it is by paying real $$$ because are greedy fucks. Wanted more knives? How about gloves? Because that is surely what the game needs right now.

2808,"[h1]Here is my comparison review on Counter-Strike: Global Offensive compared to Counter-Strike: Source:[/h1]

[u]pro:[/u]
-slightly better graphics
-integrated matchmaking finder

[u]contra:[/u]
-the hitregistration does not work properly, which is unbearable for a game focused on competitive gaming. I am not talking about tick rates here. The issue lies on the server side (I'm not talking about 64 tick btw!) and has not been fixed since the game was released almost 3 years ago. The server and client both calculate 2 different bullet spreads which many times makes bullets not hit the enemy.
-cheaters! There are so many cheaters in this game, especially on high ranks. Steam/Valve makes money by weapon skins, keys and mission coins so they frequently make a discount on CSGO. Often times you'll find the game being sold < 5 € $ £. People use these occasions to buy accounts just to use their hacks on. CSGO is jam-packed with cheaters. Some of them will get banned only after playing 300 hours.
-the hitboxes do not line up with the actual movement of a player. This is nocticeable if you try to hit someone who is jumping or planting the bomb.
-Alt-Tab does not work properly. Every time you tab out and back into the game, it takes a few seconds because the whole game renders from scratch. It gets really frustrating because all ingame props suddenly fly around and position themselves newly, but only on client side. You get some weird textures after Alt-Tabbing as well.
-The menu was so much better in CSS. All you had to do was to press ESC, that's it. You had your server browser, option menu, console, etc. opened at one with just one tap of a button and your game would run transparently in the background. Now all of this is gone and each time you press ESC in CSGO it will freeze the game for a second. I have no clue why Valve couldn't stick to the old menu. Maybe it didn't look fancy enough.
-client-side restrictions. I am talking about commands like mat_colorcorrection which are sv_cheats protected and can not be used in a normal game. Same applies to some forced graphics effects like HDR/bloom which were optional in CSS at best.
-reduced physics effects. Remember when you could hit the barrel on de_dust2 in CSS and it flew away with some decent and nice looking physics effects? Most of them are gone now.
-no 7.1 surround sound support.

Hopefully major issues in this game will get fixed if it gets ported to Source2. Untill now these are my reasons to rate this game with a thumb down.",FALSE

2830,"I Decided to rework my review of this game after the 06.06.2021 with the Prime Update.

First Here is my old Review i just posted in a short version:

Started Playing it first when it came out for about 1 year, had some fun with it, met some nice people but also serval cheaters especially on the higher ranks. Now in 2020 I just started playing CSGO again, it is still fun sometimes but since its free to play you have to “buy” the game for a huge amount of money compared to what I was about the first days, I tried it anyway without buying the game again and just went into “Community Casual” to level my game to at least level 2. That was a really bad experience since there were at least 2 guys with wallhacks. On Level 2 then I could finally enter competitive what was almost the same. One guy just steamrolled my entire team round after round. 
I wont talk about the Battle Royal stuff in this game since it has nothing to do with Counter Strike for me
Conclusion: This Game may be still a lot of fun with friend if you have an account above level 21 (for Prime Status) or you buy the Game to get Prime Status else it could be very frustrating to play. 

Update: 11.06.2021:

DO NOT BOTHER WITH THIS GAME! Be Warned!

I loved Counter Strike since my childhood, i tried hard and everything to keep this game in good memorys but HELL NO!
They Advertise this game as ""free to play"" where it is NOT! Yes, you can download and play it for free but without prime you will be lost completely. Almost everyone is cheating here and if not your account progress will be zero and also stay like zero. You dont earn a rank anymore in competetive, also no account level or drops is earned. You will be forced to buy the game for around 12 € to progress in competetiv or play against legit players.

i, who bought the game when it was released of course have prime and can earn drops, ranks or level in this game but that really doesnt matter since every 2nd game i have is a cheater in my or the enemy team. i thought its going to change with another prime account (maybe my trust factor is bad) but no, it doesnt matter. i still meet ppl with low ranked / fresh accounts .

2908,"It's clear 90% of the reviews here are written by 12 year olds so I thought I'd give an actual review.

Although I am not recommending this game, it is enjoyable. It is a FPS similar to COD but superior in competitive games by a lot. I say this mostly because there is definitely more skill involved in this game than there is in COD. You can obviously pour hundreds of hours playing competitive games ranking yourself up to the top.

So why am I not recommending this game? Well... there are a lot of reasons
1) Hackers. The number of hackers there are is bullshit, you won't see very many hackers in competitive matches as they're  reported pretty fast if they're suspected. However, in casual matches, it's possible there'll be at least one hacker per game.
2) Trolls/Smurfs. Although there are good people that play this game, you will every other game be matched with a total jackass. Either they're de-ranking, afking, spinbotting, or they just flat out leave your competitive game. Seriously, it's fucking competitive people! I don't just walk off the soccer field in the middle of a game! Then there are smurfs, people who have created an alternate steam account, bought csgo AGAIN, (srsly, don't ppl have a life) and they do this simply to wreck new players. It severely ruins the experience for new players.
3) Microtransactions. The amount of money that the game wants you to invest and the community almost bullies you into buying is ridiculous. There is a good variety of weapons in cs and each weapon/knife has a shit ton of skins. The game doesn't even try to make them fairly affordable either, let me give you some prices for popular skins.
M4A1-S Hyper Beast (Field-Tested) $30.90
AK-47 | Vulcan (Field-Tested) $40.61
AWP Asiimov (Field-Tested) $41.10
I could almost pre-order Fallout 4 twice with that kind of money, are you kidding me!! This isn't even mentioning the knives in this game that cost upwards of $100 (at least for a half decent one). And if for some reason you are interested in buying a skin, DON'T DO THE FUCKING CASES, THEY ARE A SCAM, AND YOU'LL ONLY GET SHITTY $0.15 SKINS FROM THE CASES 90% OF THE TIME.
Than their are the god awful OPERATIONS!!! Yay, adding somewhat of a plot and somewhat of missions to cs, sounds good, right? WRONG! The story to these operations are worse than my little pony fan fictions and the missions are more grindy and frustrating than MMORPGs. No fucking joke either, I've had the mission ""kill Jackson in Casual: Log"" for 2 weeks and have tried to be the one person on my team to assassinate that mother fucker, and after all the 3+ hours I wasted trying to do that, I maybe only had 4 1v1s with Jackson, and either the player was fucking high ranked, hacking, coming from behind, or I just fucked up. And that's only one mission. There are some 100 or so missions to this operation, and pretty much all of them are ABSOLUTE FUCKING GARBAGE!

So all in all, whether or not you want to buy this game comes down to these factors
1) how much money are you willing to spend other than the up-front price?
2) how serious of a gamer are you, because if you aren't going to play competitive in this game you are wasting your money.
3) Do you have friends that are playing this game, because friends is the only reason I still play this garbage.",FALSE

With the very minority of cheaters I report that do manage to get banned, Valve just gives me a pointless message of me being right and nothing else gets adjusted. The match I lost to the cheater that got banned is just lost and nothing else happens. Something like the match in question maybe being turned to a draw could've counteracted the unfairness of getting a loss because of a cheater ruining it. Don't get me wrong, this game is extremely fun if you're not against cheaters. The problem this game has is its infection of cheaters and lack of anticheat.

Valve does and will not give one single fuck until this games seize to be relevant. The huge interest of skins and case openings is the only thing that this filth of a company does care about, since that is what is giving them revenue in the short term.

I may not have a huge amount of hours on it, but I've played it for a long time.

Been playing CS since its humble beginnings, it was great fun wasting a school break or two on matches between friends.

This game later evolved and became competitive, I personally were never part of any tournaments but I have friends who were both following and participating in those tournaments. I've always found this game as a good time waster, playing only for fun. 

CS:GO introduced competitive play basically out of the box, tons of fun to be had with ranking up yourself and getting tougher challenges, but fair ones. Sure, there were cheaters but it wasn't a prevalent problem and they mostly were pretty easy to report and get rid of. 

Enter a couple of years ago when the ranking system was changed and CS:GO went F2P. A huge influx of new players entered, and so did the cheaters. Now they can simply use a burner account, re-install the game and continue as they did. Not only that, but even when you do report someone for OBVIOUSLY knowing where everyone is, or simply getting only headshots, there is no guarantee that valve or whomever gets the reports cares. 

After the changes to the ranking system, it basically became impossible to rank up against all the hackers. People simply abuse the game for all its got and don't care. You can win 10 games in a row but then get 2 games where someone's boosting the other team through hacks, never resulting in a fair match. 

Smurfing I can understand as it doesn't really involve any exploits on the player's part. Just annoying to compete with the already broken ranking system.

And man, I paid money for this. It wasn't always F2P.

From a fun pastime, this became a total waste. I've uninstalled this game and won't re-install it until I hear something positive about it, like if they implement a huge ban-wave on all the hackers. 

Sad that a game with a huge legacy, leagues and a great amount of potential fun can become so annoying and incredibly frustrating.

That's really funny that the developers bring a battle pass from now on straight into the game and cheeky to encourage people to buy and play as much as possible.

2964,"Counter Strike once has been a great community game, where it made fun to compete with other players all over the world and share a common passion. But sadly those times are finally completely over!

Valve has officially ruined an awesome community game cause of their greet for money.

What is Counter Strike of today?

A game where it is not anymore about competitive gameplay, team play, tactics and skill. Nowadays it consits only of Skins and cheaters who use SpinBot, Wallhack, Aimbot or all together. It has never been so easy to cheat in a game without any sort of punishment or justice. Just buy Yourself a new account for 7€ and start cheating. Don't worry You neither have to be careful doing it nor wait a time till Your account has some hours on it. Valve doesn't care for such things as long as You have now just bought a new account and maybe even buy some skins.

The saddest thing of it all is that they actually do nothing against it. Not even that, they also encourage You to do so. They have once invented a great system called ""prime matchmaking"" which actually did work for quite some time. But then Valve shockingly found out that You don't make money by banning all those cheaters and new accounts. So what have they done?

Correctly, they have invented something new, something better...""Trust Factor"", a system which lets You play only with players depending on their time spent in the game and behaviour and time spent in other games!!???! You might wonder what factor in CSGO it can be about how much other games You play? And I tell You, You are right. This stuff has nothing to do with it and the best part is it doesn't even work. Doesn't matter how often You play this game or how many hours you have in it, You are still put together with new hacker accounts which only have 11 hours on their account and spin bot arround. However that is still not the best! It gets better, way better! Cause of the new ""better"" system ""Trust Factor"" they seemed to have turned off ""Prime Matchmaking"". Now ""Trust"" is automatically selected if You play or open a lobby, but even if You would switch back to ""Prime"" it wouldn't make a difference. There would be still opponnents with spin bot or other hacks, being happy that they can ruin Your game.

As a final word I just want to make You aware that there is no other game where You can play 5 games in a row each with someone spin-botting. In which all those hackers have accounts of 600h or more (sometimes even 2000 hours), telling You that they won't be banned because they do that since day one of CSGO and have never been cought. 

SAD THING: They are right.

There are new FPS games are trying to be the real competitor against to CSGO, eg: Volorant.
Volorant has its own problem, however there are so many new things which csgo can learn from it. But unfortuntely gabe just keep selling skins and operations.... that s all.

couple of ideas CSGO needs to start to think on their road map:
1. Team death match with unique team death map, not just put dust2 into the deathmatch mode. CSGO really needs to look after their cacual players, STOP keep updating some random scrammble maps, and really? how many players are really playing them?

2. Kills notice should be adopted. look at COD, CF, VOLORANT, they are all got kills notice in the middle of the screen. i know people will say it is lame... but have you ever thinking about if it is so lame, but why other games are keeping having this feature?

3. Buying system. now, if you played volorant, you will know you can help teammate to purchase weapon, and also re-sell the weapon if u bought it by mistake. it is a very useful and user friendly system, and there is no negative point for CSGO not adopting it.

4. try to reduce each game's time, nowadays players time are not solid and focus, 90 mins of the game is too long. 

and last but not the least: i cant see valve is working hard on CSGO even DOTA2, look at the population of players for CSGO and DOTA2 are dropping from twitch, and see all players have been dominating by LOL and VOLORANT. VALVE should start to worry about this fact now! instead of selling the bloody boxes, if VALVE wont change soon, then this game is dying, despite the fact Wallhack still appearing.

3010,This game ruined my life.,FALSE
3011,"[strike]A great sequel of the one and only shooter game for people that like tactical play and hardcore aiming. Maps are good and the recoil system requires some good practice.
Even though I think it would have been better to create a game more similar to the game Counter-Strike: Source, but that is just my personal opinion.

The only problem in this game is the amount of cheaters and the fact that the game price gets changed to 3,49 sometimes which means that there will be a huge hacker wave again. Valve should do something about it or create an anti-cheat that you can CHOOSE to enable for matches on protected servers.[/strike]

So as a software dev and after 6,300+ hours in this mess where I achieved Global, reached level 10 on leagues like FaceIt and have played many competitive matches with various professionals, I have changed my opinion on this game.
The last review was written in 2013, where the game was still being improved, but now we are playing a game that is 5 years old, yet still feels like early access / beta..

In 2014, skins were introduced to cs, which I thought were not bad for the game, since it's only cosmetic. This though, started the whole money-making-machine for Valve. Patches became worse and less stable, but they released plenty of skins, which I do not mind, but in my opinion the game's health and playerbase should be more important.

Valve talks about how there is little to none communication from their side, because that makes it 'more special and of higher quality' when they do, but this is also just a bad excuse.

There was a time where the AK's first bullet accuracy was insanely accurate, which resulted to players getting rewarded for their time in the game and their dedication to becoming better. This is something that Valve does not seem to like, so they implemented RNG to 'make it more fair for newer players'. Just think about this for a second. RNG in a skillbased game to make it more fair for newer players. Does that sound like they want a good game, or like they want money?

Except for the insane RNG and the bad hitreg, the game became very delayed after they released the new animation and capsule hitboxes update in 2015/2016. The update was great, but the implementation felt unfinished and resulted in the game being broken since that point. Not many have realised this, but sadly, it is true.

A thing that Valve talks about, which is the reason for this messy hitreg, is the server-sided hitregistration. For people that are not familiar with game engines and how games are programmed, just know this. The more server-sided a game is, the more delayed it will become because every server-sided action requires information to be sent from the client to the server and from the server to all players. So you might be wondering: ""How come that the game still feels 'smooth.'"". That is because the game is using interpolation to predict moves based on various variables that are currently active.
Even though this sounds good, it causes terrible issues with the hitreg, but they did this to fight the cheaters, because server-sided actions cannot be hacked and invalid (cheat) information that you send to the server will be detected in an instant.
Despite this very positive sounding system, except for the hitreg issues, this game is [b]full[/b] of cheaters. 
If you look at games like Overwatch, which was made by Blizzard, you will notice that it uses client-sided hitreg with a validation process on the server, which results in [b]perfect[/b] hitreg.
You might be asking yourself: ""But what about the whole cheater problem?"".
It's very easy.. Blizzard cares and makes a good anti-cheat, which is why you barely see any cheaters. With 1000 hours in Overwatch to this point, I have met only 1 cheater, who was banned in the match that we were playing.

Valve cares so much about money and communicates so little with the community that you could expect them to be as shady as having deals with cheat providers just to farm money.

At this moment, there is a operation running, which we waited for, for over a year. You would expect this operation to be awesome, yet it is just another repeat of the previous operations, using maps that the community has made. Sounds nice, does it not?

I do not recommend this game, just because of the fact that the game is still feeling like a beta game, a money machine and it feels like the developers are not even trying to fix it.
There are various bugs that the community has found and or even solved for Valve, which they have not fixed after multiple years.

Also, just to end this review, Valve is using a development strategy where you fix something, but break something else just so that you can fix it to make it look like you are doing something. This is a well known strategy to keep your community happy, but it is easy to spot when Valve fixes something like a radar command but breaks an entirely different thing that in no way is connected to the thing that they have fixed.

When I first got the game, it was fun. Learning the maps, ranking up, and seeing progress.

It became a constant loop of cheaters, smurfs, and BS matchmaking.

The producers of the game, Valve, don't care about the community what so ever.

Every update either added a new case, made maps look nicer, or changed game mechanics that were perfectly fine before.

The newest operation (Operation Hydra) was a big let down and none of us were impressed after waiting over a year for it.

Well from the point of writting this review I have about 600+ hours in this game. Let us go over the positives first shall we?

Positives:

+ From a casual point of view, the game is generally fun it is like older Call of Duty titles but yet more simple.
+ It has decent graphics and they will probably improve even more with the introduction to Source Engine 2.
+ It is moddable and it has various mods like surf, zombies, deathrun and many others.
+ It does not cost much and it is delightful to play with friends. (I cannot stress how important this is.)
+ Weapon finishes, you can obtain some through playing the game. Sadly those are usually the worst and through opening cases that require a key you can only buy.
+ It will feel very rewarding winning competitive matches and being on the top of the board.

Negatives:

- The community of this game on the EU/Russian servers is atrocious. I know nothing about other servers.

- Fictional weapon finishes that can cost x100 - x1000 times over the games price. This is as I understood the fault of the community.

- It can be extremely frustrating playing the competetive scene as it dose get more complex with learning the maps, weapon spray patterns, monitoring the playstyle of the opposition, bad tickrate, in recent time server issues and so on...

- It will seem so that the more you play competitive the more skeptical you will be of others due to a large influx of cheaters  especially on higher ranks. Also ""smurfs"" (people that are skilled  in the game, playing on alternative accounts of lower ranks.) this may rise to the point of paranoia in every match.

Overall the game is fun to play with friends as long as you can take the beating of every other issue and the point of only playing competitive. I will probably continue to play this game because of my friends or sheer motivation that might come out of nowhere, but if you are looking to have fun solo you might want to look else where.",FALSE
3095,took all my money. cant recommend this,FALSE
3096,"This game used to be fun to play back in the day. Now, I can't recommend this. Here is why: 

- With Valve's decision to make this game free. It's now filled with a lot of cheaters and you can't enjoy matchmaking anymore.

- The anti-cheat software is really bad. Report as much as you want. Nothing will happen.

- Toxic community. The community used to have nice people. Now it's filled with fucking idiots.

- Cases and skins. I have opened a lot of cases and purchased skins. I now regret doing all that. You will not get anything from cases and the skins are too expensive. Stupid prices! 

- Don't bother buying any of the shitty operation passes, save your money for something else instead, its worthless I got nothing, legit nothing from that piece of shit. Saved all my stars for a grand opening, only to get shit worthless skins. Legit a scam and fuck you!

3118,"Pretty good game what were okay pre 2016. I can tell game started 2 fall down into something super bad, at least for me. In that time I had [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=840862100]supreme[/url] rank and was playing on pretty high lvl even tho never was even a bit good. 
What i can tell against this game?
1. In nearly every game you've someone who is literally boosted and someone who is playing [b]really [/b] good
2. It’s from 1st some games even on supreme and LEM looks like 2 ppl from different teams are playing 1v1 and 8 others are jsut meat who die and sometimes plant\defuse bomb
3. You can’t be sure about [b]anyone[/b] in this game. Overwatch same as VAC anti cheat are workign only when they want and I know minimum one person who got ban on acc only after 500h playign with cheats. And in 90% games when someone plays good u jsut rage on thsi eprson cz you jsut cant be sure if this person is good or he\she jsut cheat
4. Cases. I won’t even explain why it’s bad, just ill ask, do you like 2 get super bad drop for ur money? 80% skins no one use cuz they are just bad. Some of skins you won’t see at all even after 1k hours and not cuz they are expensive or so, but cuz they are ugly
5. Graffiti. Also 2016. Maybe someone remember how u were getting something else then graffiti after game. At least cheapest skin. Rn u can get maximum graffiti or case. You'll cry as happy kid if u get something what worth more than 1 cent. And next question for this all. Do I need this 1 cent when bought game for 10 euro? I don’t think so
6. Whole matchmaking system and valve servers. Most time when i played cs I was playing not alone (yep, boosted) and fact that I can’t take server what i want just was making me mad. Maybe one day valve will realize that different people can waste on game different amount of time. For example Turkish MGE isn’t same as Swedish MGE. Let people choose server and don't throw me with 4 Turkish guys who I don’t understand and who don't talk German neither English even on elementary (A1!) level against 5 Swedish premade after 20sec search. I can wait no need 2 hurry pls. And on top of this its okay 2 get connected somewhere when you both with your premade will have 100+ ping. 
7. Let’s be honest you need buy new devices 2 play this game well, or you'll get a lot of problems climbing up with your ball mouse and 20fps
8. Even on high ranks you'll see pretty often guys who just run head shot you with deagle. Lucky shots are 40% of the gameplay here. And remember punkt 3 from this review please. Never be sure about anyone in game
9. Awful support. Maybe I just was unlucky but I was used to fix my game problems by my own(VAC errors and other stuff).
10. Ranks. Hey, you got MG1 after Gold nova? Well, nothing changed hf. Here are same ppl. LEM and supreme? Same. It’s just picks in your ingame profile what you'll screen to show to your friends if you've any (you don't, sorry). They could just have silver, gold nova, Master Guardian, Supreme and global. Nothing would change. If you place 3 potatoes in 3 boxes this will be anyway 3 potatoes and not anything else. 
11. Useless patches. They change nothing for you as common player or just ruin game for next few weeks. Added R8? 10 cowboys on map cz R8 was used to one shot in body. Why they made this in game where ur winrate is most important thing? I’ve no idea. Probably they dont want waste time and money on people who could test this before going in live servers. Just don’t waste your time on patch note. There will be: 1. New <name> case. 2. Something what you can’t check. 3. Negev got cheaper.
12. New Dust 2. Laggy, buggy, but new (Everyone who i know dislike it)
13. I wanna see my MMR at least somewhere and not just wait when I get new rank.

But anyway its good game 2 play if you like shooters and like to see how you improve. Also may be fun for someone who has friends\gf\bf 2 play this game on lower ranks. After MGE game lose all fun part and turn into typical winrate simulator.

09.07.2020
Played this game 400 hours more cuz my freinds
1) MM dead, cant play it anymore(reached supreme again and stopped playing cuz cheaters)
Have seen only 1 ban during game when was playing my twink.
2) Joined faceit - played all maps at least 20 games. Some maps as Dust 2 have 0 gameplay for 4 players, but AWP
3) Faceit is great service with 0 defence agaisnt cheaters expect fact being separated from CS GO
4) On Faceit u can play 1+1+1+1+10 lvls against lvl5 and destroy em even without cheats (about cheats a bit more down)
5) All get lvl 1-3 (if u dont play party with 10lvls on start, my friend got lvl 8 and dont play there rn, cz dont feel comfortable) => hand made elo-hell specially for u, where silvers and globals cook together making a nice swamp
6) oh, u got lvl 6? good job! Rememeber #4? So, this ppl who want 2 get boost can play with cheats who payed for faceit chat whole 5 euro. Ah, yes, cs is free rn, they lose same money as before 2 cheat, but need pay for time with cheat and not for new CS copy. Lvl 1 with 40 hours in cs? Ofc! here we go 40 kills and insane timmings ALWAYS
7) U cant detect cheats in this game. I've one friend who play with WH already 2k hours.
8) its not about faceit. My last game in MM was agianst ppl with 1k euro+ inventories each who used bhop scripts and shoot over walls while having hitbox separated from model (yes they dont give a fuck about bans cz they never get ban)

This game is awful, the community is even worse. There is no way to rank up from eagle 2 playing solo.
Every single game there are a minimum of 2 players without a mic and one griefer.

But let me summarise the game with a story.

Playing Cache. After starting, there were 3 people without a mic, rushing as T in cache and dying round after round, they never gave  info. I got backstabbed 4 times in a row since cts were pushing everywhere. But that was not it. I asked ""Guys why do u play competitive without a mic"". Next round I found myself dead, by two Terrorists (team), they took my gun. After this round I get  a p90, do a -90 to a guy but not killing him, asking him to stop the griefing. Then 4 rounds pass we are losing 10-3, I drop a decoy in T base. 3 of those teammates go and step on it; waiting for it to explode. Decoy explodes and i am KICKED from the session for doing team damage.

So what are the lessons learned.
- Friendly fire algo logic is beyond everything
- 50% of players dont have a mic
- 60% of the people having a mic, have a sleeping baby but choose to play competitive
- Griefers are rewarded.
- Kick system requires all 4 votes. If griefers have a teammate, Good Game.
- 60% of the players choose to switch sides every 2-3 rounds just because they bought an AWP
- 71% of the time you are holding a side, nobody comes but instead they go to the other side, you end up playing 2 vs 5
- On top of that, 1/5 games has a cheater

There are several reasons why this game is still played due to its easy availability and high prevalence. It is not hard to invite any of your friends to play cs. Any weak player can easily buy or download cheats. Cheats are a separate scourge of this game. Also, this game has its own market (on which, by the way, more than one fraudulent network is built). This is also the reason why the game is so widespread, not only Valve are interested in her life.

To: Valve

Dear Valve, 

Look, i don't wanna ungrateful here. I know, you delivered us free gamemode and make CS:GO F2P so server gain popularity. That's good, but... HOW IN THE EARTH YOU ALLOW PEOPLE GETTING PRIME FOR FREE? Now cheaters just have to make new account and level it to 21 before start hacking in prime, if someone levels 2 times a week, it takes 10 weeks, 2 month 2 weeks, but afaik they usually level 2 and 1/3 which means it only take 2 months, to get prime without paying, seriously....

Please Valve, make Prime DLC ONLY, you still have time to fix this, don't fail us. I even got some friends that are higher ranked than mine, even two global, and they going to quit if they meet kids in prime just in 2 more months. I am sure my entire university going to quit because of this, 20 of my friends already sold all his skin and start forgetting csgo, thus getting idea for winter sale to move on to other game.

Also make casual separated, prime matchmaking should ensure prime only to join, and non prime with non prime

You still have time to fix, do it Valve!

Sincerely Yours,
A Random 1.7k hours 2016 Ex-MG1 User.

- Basicly the devs of the game dont improve the game they implement optics

- The weapons are unbalanced as fuck, like why does the bizon or the r8 exist?

   trash
- The playerbase of normal ranked is just shit, if you want csgo ranked in better go to facit or 
   esea

- And yeah cheaters ... A lot of the players think the enemy cheat just because his aim and reactiontime is way better. Here are some pro tips what you do when you encounter a potential cheater:
  ->report
  ->dont go in all-chat and accuse the chreater because they will just wank to that.
     Some cheaters want just ruin the game for others because they feel powerfull that way or 
     something like that, so ignoring them is the best way to reply.
  ->dont go to their profile and comment on their profile. They will wank to that too.
  ->if you want to payback the cheaters you can unlock the overwatch tool and then 
     just review some matches with potential cheaters and ban them that way.
     It isnt very effective because csgo is free to play now so they just create a new account but 
     maybe a little satisfaction.
-If you want fun in csgo dont go for ranked or for the skins, go for the custom-servers
 you will have more fun there

- The steam marked. The place where an knife can cost 2000$ ...
- Csgo is one of the first game with lootboxes. These decrease the fun of every game

3227,"This game is terrible -- I only paid something like $3-$4 for it to add it to my half-life collection, and it's not even worth that much.

I've played counter-strike for almost 20 years now (since the original CS beta 3.1), and this game is completely broken.  You don't have to go far searching online to see how bad the client/server mismatch is, so if you expect your bullets to hit what you seen on your screen, guess again.  Essentially your time spent aiming is wasted since there is something very wrong with the netcode in this game.

The game has no shortage of hackers, and Valve doesn't seem to do much to prevent hacking in the first place, despite periodic claims by Valve that they've banned something like 90,000 hackers in a week.  Literally two days ago there was an individual on a casual dust2 server with auto-aim (head) and auto-fire enabled.  I've seen this type of hack in CS since the beginning, so I know what it looks like, especially when you can first-person spectate in the game to see the player's reactions.  At one point this individual was AFK in CT spawn, and anytime a T dropped down from the catwalk or came around one of the CT spawn corners, the individual's screen would instantly snap to the person, fire, and shoot them in the head at a rate only a computer could do on its own.  And when I say shoot in the head I mean only in the head, as in every single shot was a headshot.  This hacker single handledly ruined the game for everyone playing in that server and this is a common occurrence.

The community is EXTREMELY toxic.  Join a public server and you'll hear anyone from 10 years old to 60 years old using racist language (for no real apparent reason) and no shortage of people microphone spamming.  I usually have to turn down the voice chat volume to essentially nothing, or mute at least half the server.  I don't remember ever having to do that sort of stuff back in the CS 1.6 days, but for whatever reason this gaming community has a serious toxicity problem.  I wouldn't let my own kids play this game just for that simple reason.

This game has bugs, but the bugs seem to manifest differently for different players.  There was a span of about 2 weeks where my sound would completely stop working in ""competitive"" matches, which made me almost useless to my teammates.  No other programs running on my computer had any sound issues at the time -- only CS:GO had issues.  In fact it wasn't just that the sound was dying in the middle of matches, I could actually change my sound settings in game, like from stereo to surround sound, and the game would undo the changes I made WHILE I was playing the game.  I've searched online and many other people have had similar issues over the entire lifespan of this game.

The game also periodically stutters for me.  I don't have the newest computer, but my computer is far from being slow.  No other programs/games I run have any stuttering issues what so ever.  But every so often this game will freeze for a quarter or maybe half a second just as I'm lining up a shot and trying to fire.  By the time it stops stuttering the other player has already killed me before I could get off a single shot.  Kind of defeats the purpose of playing the game if you can't actually play the game.

For anyone transitioning from older versions of CS to CS:GO, many ""original"" maps (dust2, inferno, etc.) still exist in the game, but Valve decided to change them for CS:GO.  ""If it ain't broken don't fix it"" apparently doesn't resonate at Valve, so rather than spend time creating more new maps, they just spent time ruining the classics.

In summary this game is not worth your money (really Valve, $14.99 for this ""masterpiece""?).  You can spend all day trying to figure out how to tweak your settings to get the best gameplay, or spend hours getting accustomed to the ""feel"" of this game, but nothing you do will fix any of the issues I noted above.  You can have excellent aim, and careful, steady mouse positioning, but the randomness of the CS:GO gameplay and latency issues will completely destroy your experience.  And if the gameplay doesn't destroy your experience, the toxic community certainly will.

3278,"I love this game but I do not recommend it. Why? Where do I start.. hmmm. 

There's too many cheaters.. too many toxic players and the ranking system is absolutely inaccurate that it's such a big joke.

Valve and Steam allowed smurf accounts which means that you are playing against what you think are lower rank or same rank players as you but actually they are much higher ranked players using their new accounts. Matchmaking is b*ll sh*t because it will randomly match you with higher rank opponents which makes your comp game unfair and a waste of time because your higher ranked opponents are just shooting you left and right without a chance to defend yourself and shoot back lol.. but you can't leave the game or you will have a time ban lol.. so basically, you're fu*ked. AND about cheaters and a**holes? It's bad enough playing against them.. but go queue solo or up to 2 or 3 of your mates.. and you will get either toxic random players or cheats.. you will get verbally abused or get penalyzed for playing with cheats in your team. Either way.. you and your team mates lose. The toxicity in this game is extremely high. Parents.. do not allow your kids to play this game. Kids and teenagers and adults get harrassed, bullied and stalked here. There are toxic players telling kids to kill themselves. 

I've been in touch with Steam Support numerous times and have told them about the issues I'm talking about here.. and although they have replied to each of my messages.. telling me about this and that and how they are dealing with these problems.. after nearly 1600 hours playing this game.. I do not see any improvements at all. They tell me.. oh report the cheaters and that's how to get them banned.. but little is being done to remove the cheaters, so basically.. anyone doing extremely well in games are accused of cheating lol.. because really.. we are just so sick of the cheaters - and with so many players being reported for cheating, legitly or not.. OW probably doesn't assign enough individuals to review all these reported players to ban the legit cheaters from those wrongly accused in this game. AND.. if you are wrongly accused of cheating by players.. you may get a Low Trust Factor which means you and your team mates will have a higher chance of playing cheaters in your comp games. It's a vicious cycle.. created by Steam.. who is responsible to fix it but won't.

So please report cheaters and toxic players and Steam will waste your time Not Banning most of them lol. It's okay to be optimistic (I was too).. but don't hold your breath waiting - or you might just turn blue and die. Valve and Steam are doing minimal work in removing these toxic players, these cheaters from this game and not fixing the ranking system and matchmaking in comps.. so I conclude that they just don't give a sh*t about this game. Who cares about new features and who cares about the new Panorama update.. if Steam doesn't fix the cheating and toxicity and the ranking and matchmaking system.. this game is still full of sh*t no matter what new ""improvements"" they add to it. This is an Extremely Negative review of CSGO and Valve and Steam but it's an Extremely Accurate one. Don't bother buying this game.. it's probably dying a slow and painful death. Eventually.. I will be playing with Bots and I'm fine with that..at least they don't cheat or give me sh*t lol.",FALSE

Lets just kill the F'ING game on the way up, i've bin playing cs since before steam.. Valve have p.i.s.s.e.d. us all in the face from the beginning.

3281,"i play competitive , first class is the rank , after 5 years of cs go , it doesn't change a lot , they update many things but they dont change many other :

- BOT if a player leave in game, and it happen a lot (in competitive) the BOT still doing what they want , buying what they want (even if you give order to them), and their is still no real sanction for leaver , you just take a ban for 30min/1h/24h/7days , so you juste have to wait to can re-play , they should put a system similar to dota² (low priority)

- instead of making great remake of old map (toscan,prodigy,chateau,etc..) we all loved play on other cs (1.6,cz,css) they do new map like canal ,it make no sense for me , 

- their is on this game an HIGH level of paranoia /hack , but sometimes its real :D , still no change they just ban the steam account but not material so hacker just have to buy the game again on an new account  , (the prime matchmaking is a good point ) 

-they add new weapon for example : R8-Revolver was the most useless new gun i ever seen in counter strike (i would love see mp5 , tactical-shield etc  ) 

-they prefer add new skin and win a lot of money, when they can improve server tick ( 64 in mmr instead of 128 ),

-still no compendium on cs go ... or something similar
 
-i think the people who make this game doesn't play to it , they just take money and its sad , counter strike is a real good game but wasted by idiot , ty hidden path , ty valve

i still like play often with friend to this game but i can't recommand this game to new player you probably making an big misstake , this is not worth it :D don't buy it , don't play it

Prime matchmaking is a joke. In the span of one night I achieved SE and then lost it after three more games. One was lost to people who were so obviously wallhacking, it was painful.

I finallly had enough and i am writing this negative review because of it. 

GG valve GG.",FALSE
3297,"Great game, with amazing potential. But lack of developer trancparency and rampant cheating will lead to it's downfall.

Lets start this off by saying V.A.C. is a joke... it doesn't do much other than be a meme for the community to bash on. Valve makes billions of micro transaction and yet does nothing to improve player experience by cracking down on cheater and hackers. Every low skill competetive game is full of smurfs (players with alot of experience playing in lower level games) and or hackers. Valves overwatch program catches non cheating players who happen to have a streak of good games/plays, and fails to capture the ""closet hackers"" - or people who using hacks, but play a style that makes it seem that don't. 

""Prime Matchmaking"" failed to deliver on it's goal of seperating out cheatings/smurfs from players who wan't to play against players their skill level and have a good time. It was a good idea, worked at first, but if a player can get a program undetectable by VAC, how hard is it for them to buy Prime Ready Accounts, and get access to a phone number?

Rumors have been spreading on community forums that Valve is in the works of a ""Super VAC"" yet it's been 5 or so years since the games launch, and they yet to deliver on anything more than in game accessories (gun skins, stickers, music kits, GLOVES, pins, etc) and questionable mechanic changes. I understand they want to make money - but who is going to buy their products when no one is around because of the shakey servers and toxic/hacking community.

I'm extremely disappointed in Valve - like many others, this review will get drowned in the vastness of QQ and phony reviews. There is only one way to getting Valve to act...

Boycott all Valve microtransactions. I'm am no longer buying any more products through Counter Strike or any other valve game until they make reforms to match making. When they have they revenue stream in jeopardy - only then will they listen to player/community concerns and start making changes we want/need to see.

For current players, I feel your struggle, hear your cries, and share your rage. Stop purchacing valve skins, keys, kits, pins, whatever. Stop using the community market and boycott all valve micro transactions.

For future players - hold off from playing this game, the current experience will only turn you away and make your want to quit before you have seen the small glimor of light that is the csgo community. As well, don't purchase the game unless you are ready to pay 5$ a month for a 3rd party subscrition in order to have a decent competetive experience.

TL:DR - Game has potential, but too many hackers. Valve doesnt do ENOUGH to remedy the issues...
Use your wallet as your voice, stop buying Valve related products (including your favorite skins) until our concerns and issues are addressed and fixed.",FALSE
3298,"My review about this game.

Good things:
1.Can mess around with friends in competitive, which is fun.
2.Weapons (P90,Mp5,ak47,m4 and more)
3.Maps are very good(Mirage,Office,Cache)


Negative things:
1. A LOT of cheaters (which makes not fun in this game anymore, especially in nonprime.)
2. Free to play (I mean wtf valve, why did you do that?)
3. Gambling (Gambling was good till 2018, until they made a new trading system, which just sucks!)
4. New game mode DANGER ZONE (i mean this gamemode is sometimes fun but it ruins this game)
5. Community (I mean wow, it's really negative, but there's some half good tho)
6. Toxic players (Every time when you play solo, your teammate gets mad and it's just annoying)
7. Servers (please valve fix csgo servers, it's sometimes laggy)
8. Rank system (It's really damn broken since 2015)
9. Trust factor (I have very low trust factor, which means more cheaters, and toxic players which just sucks)
10. AWP is broken. And fix M249 for once.
My opinion: This game sucks, i only play it because it's sometimes fun with my friends together.

Either revert the latest change or drop your tax by at least half of what it is currently; and make the trade ban on items 24 hours or even better; remove it entirely. Skins are a huge part if not the biggest single thing to get this game to where it's at; and crippling trading doesn't do anything positive even to yourself. Scamming is the exact same if not more prevelant due to people panicking that their skins aren't worth much; they can get desperate and sell to some paypal salesman which is such a prolific scam but people will actually be willing to try it.

3362,"This game has a focus on community and coop gameplay. Game experience for players is therefore based on how well the community is doing. I recently started playing CS:GO after i had it years  in my steam library. I know CS since the year 2000 and i was more than shocked from the experience.

For just random play without thinking too much, its perfectly fine to play Deathmatch, Demolition, ArmsRace or Casual. Its fast, it´s random. Basically everything that other shooters can do too.

If you want to experience the ""real"" gameplay, which was ""Standard gameplay"" from my old CS 1.6 and before days, you need to play competitive mode. First of all - for every 2 game wins, you get 21 hours blocked from playing. In every game (yes, really in EVERY game) people are insulting, flaming, accousing others of hacking or voting to kick players that are not doing so well. There is no friendly atmosphere or no ""team-play"". 

From my personal experience, when i won a game, i get accused of hacking or beein a so called smurf (a person that has multiple accounts with lower rank to bash low skilled players) because i have now a total of ~80 gamehours CS:GO (with around 2000+h of CS1.6 + earlier experience). When i fuck up our game i get either insulted, teamattacked or kicked by my team. With now seven competitive wins, i got paired against a 5-player team, each around 1k-2k hours of gametime. We didn´t win a single round in the whole match. To summarize this game experience: (""ez"", ""noobs"", ""deinstall game or learn2play b00ns"",""you s*ck"",""you are sh*t"") vs (""cheaters, a**holes, ""smurfs"", ""reported you"", ""i f*** your mum""). 

The question i am asking myself now: Why? I could have burried my old memories from playing CS 1.6 instead i ended up with this. When did Counterstrike become such a playground for uneducated kids and even grown-ups?

[Update 2020] I playedit again - i have prime matchmaking enabled and doing a few casual rounds with a friend, Wingman. We get only matched against Steam Accounts that are Level 1 - 10 and younger than a year. Twice played against an obvious Wallhacker.

->Gameplay and shooting mechanincs still superior to many current games after all these years

Cons:
-> No DX11 support
->Game is full of hackers,even more so after the game went free to play.
->VAC is a joke. It is not even able to detect a free version of EZFrags cheats if  updated regularly, let alone premium cheats
->Cheaters keep coming back with new free account since there is no consequence on getting banned in non-prime
->Even prime accounts don't requre phone number, so hackers can now hack even on prime without the fear of their primary Id getting banned
->Matchmaking is totally messed up. I could be GN2 and still be matched with DMG 
->No official 128 tick servers

3380,"That's just unfair for those who paid the game, nevertheless it allows more cheaters and spoiled brats to play.

A few months ago I received a GSLT permanent ban (+ 1 month cooldown in CSGO), therefore I can't own a legit Valve server anymore, because a friend of mine (who also have access to my CSGO server) installed a server plugin which changed the weapon models of the players and he didn't know it's against their rules. OK, that's fine, I indirectly broke the rules and I deserve the ban (even if it's a permanent ban).

What I don't deserve is making the game free after I paid for it and still have that *hugging* permanent ban.

Summary:
* Bugs, bugs everywhere... unoptimized game...
* Plenty of cheaters and spoiled brats. This ""free"" thing will only increase the number of them.
* VAC/VNET is a *hugging* big joke. Only a small ammount of cheaters are banned and they are banned after a few weeks/months later after they used the cheats...
* CSGO's Prime account is another *hugging* joke, there are plenty of cheaters with Prime account enabled.
* Valve doesn't give a *redacted* what players want and definitely they don't give a *redacted* about the quality of their games anymore, they only care about money (see the CSGO market) and popularity against other competitors (like Fortnite or PUBG).

3383,"An otherwise OK shooter plagued by predatory monetization and punishing game design choices.

The biggest problem is, of course, in-game items sold for real money. And the only way to add them to the system is via gambling - loot boxes. You have to buy a key and hope that you get item that is worth it. Of course, the only winner here is Valve. Once you got your item, you can sell it on Community Market and Valve gets a cut from every transaction.

StatTrak weapon skins only count kills of real players. So people who want to play with bots on their own rules are punished by not having their kills counted. And people who see high kill counts of other players with StatTrak skins will be emotionally manipulated into buying these expensive skins.

Competitive skill groups. The game places a very high importance on your skill group by prominently showing it on a main menu. So you are emotionally manipulated into playing competitive matches to improve your skill group. And of course, any competition between psychologically immature people leads to tons of toxicity and very negative gaming experience. Also, if you quit competitive match in the middle of it, you are punished with a cooldown of up to 7 days. So the game manipulates you to play a non-fun mode and then punishes you for being a victim of manipulation.

The game has some very questionable and extremely punishing game design choices. It makes sense for terrorists to buy weapons at the beginning of the round but counter-terrorists? Isn't the government supposed to provide these for free? And of course, if you are killed, you are punished by starting the next round with less money than your opponent. So you are punished for being a victim. So you buy a weapon than is worse than your opponent's because your opponent had more money and get killed again. Punished for being a victim again. And this usually goes for 4 whole rounds until the game offers the only ""mercy option"" it has - loss bonus - so you can actually buy weapons that are on par with your opponent's.

So the game has predatory monetization and outright cruel game design. What kind of community do you think such cruel game cultivates? Sexists, racists, nationalists, xenophobes, homophobes, transphobes, ableists, sanists... All kinds of hateful people. It is only fun with friends and a minority of non-toxic people.",FALSE

Not only is it the final nail in the coffin for this poor, abused and mistreated game, but its a clear sign of valve's abandonment of the fair fans and the retracting of their already shit support in combatting hacking. This game has now become a quick cash grab for a already money floundering game producer,  whom has produced beautiful games in the past, but is now a bunch of new, useless devs with no direction and a crapton of money. All the good devs have left valve. We, the players now have no choice but to either face cod trash, smurfs and hacking cunts alone in the casual and compeditive servers or succumb to valve's 20 dollar (AU) demand (which might i add only give players what was once free and some cheap shit drops). I refuse to choose neither, and personally i am not abandoning counterstrike. I am going to do what many have done as these updates have become shitter and quit csgo altogether to find solace in its predecessors CSS and CS 1.6. I began playing these profusely fun games way before csgo, in 2008. It was in this time i had the most fun. Early csgo was promising and good, however valve's uselessness has finally prevailed and now the game is but a burnout shell of its former self image intended by the original, OG devs that made it. This was one of the last games they left us before they left us.

If you want a consistant competitive game, don't buy Counter-Strike Global Offensive. 
I have played ~1700h on several accounts but today I can finally say it : this game is complete bullsh*t. 
The absence of clear matchmaking ranking system, the absence of good matchmaking servers and, on top of that, a really cancerous community make the game unplayable. 

1) I have, at this day (25/07/17), the Legendary Eagle rank, but I have friends at Gold Nova rank and I played with them on a secondary account, in order to have fun with them without compromising my actual rank, I can tell you for certainty : this game is filled with cheaters and smurfs (secondary accounts of experienced players playing in lower ranks solely to destroy new players). An actual Silver/Gold Nova player can't win a game anymore if he's not getting carried by a smurf. Trust me I'm not the worst kind of smurfs, I mostly balance the superiority of the other team smurfs : I haven't played a single game without at least one smurf in the other team this mounth (or as far as I can remember), when I was in Gold Nova rank.

2) The CS:GO MMR (MatchMaking Rank) and CS:GO Competitive servers are completly broken. The MMR doesn't represent your actual skill and the servers are not powerful enough for ""hardcore"" competitive gameplay which causes a lot of hit registration issues or giving players living in the servers country an advantage (living in France, I'm tired of playing on Poland servers against 5-of-ping Polish people). Let's not talk about the in-game bugs, some of them still not fixed after several years...

3) CS:GO is a really bad optimized game, nothing more to say about it, I have been having unsolvable FPS issues for a long time, although I have a powerful enough computer.

I could stay here all day, but if you want a last reason not to waste your time, the developpers don't care about their communities : they could fix all the problems this game has, but it's not their priority, they just want to make money and it has been more and more obvious lately... 

I kinda feel like an hypocrit because, first of all, I'm one of those smurfs trashing the game, and also because, in a way, I really like this game, I spent a lot of hours having fun on it, I spent a lot of money in skins (f*ck me) and I'll probably still play it next year, but the bad sides are too big for me to recommend this game to new players.

To sum up, what would make CS:GO a good game : 
- mindful developpers who listen to their community
- 128 tick servers and country dedicated servers
- a new MatchMaking Ranking system (which would be explained and understandable to everyone)
- a way to remove all smurfs (yes even me, I don't even care anymore) and cheaters (by limiting CS:GO accounts by IP and by adding a better Anti-Cheat system)

Unless you have played this game for years when it was in it's glory back in the day, this may be good to play now, but even then the game sucks compared to yesteryear. My recommendation. Play VALORANT. Even WarOwl pretty much says Valorant is the CS we should be getting but Fatboy at Valve does not listen.

So here is what you have to deal with

Cheating. Oh yes, LOTS of cheating. Valve has a terrible and overly outdated anti-cheat in place. There have been no updates in several years. Their latest anti cheat update is a message telling people Not to Cheat. I kid you not. 


Smurfs. Yup, these malackas appear very often. Valve acknowledges them as a problem but does nothing to help the problem.


Trolls and griefers. I am sure that every game has em, but the amount of internet tough guys is amazing. If they can only play as good as they can dish out insults. 

Toxic players. Yup, its pretty sad. See above comment.


Then Valve has their useless updates that do nothing. They make operations that are lame AF. They release cases that you buy and gamble a lot of money only to get a gun worth a few cents. And if you do get a great find in a case, it won't last long value wise as another case will come out shortly after and severely devalue your prized item.

I think Shi'thead finds it amusing to just troll it's clients by putting restrictions on skins and cases as well. You get a case reward from the operation. BOOM, can't sell it for a week. Thanks fatso. 

Every now and then there is an update that actually betters the game, but it is extremely rare, like being able to drop nades for teammates. But keep in mind, it took them YEARS to figure that one out. I don't think the intelligence pool at Valve is very high. If it is, it is severely held back by someone who clearly doesn't care and doesn't want to see the game progress forward in a positive way. 
 

The game use to be intensely skill based, but now it has become the complete opposite. Strategy has gone out the window and Instant Gratification is the new norm. What happens next is that these new players have this image of themselves as being gods of destruction by getting EZ kills with EZ guns and EZ wins, that when faced with a more veteran team, they get destroyed on embarrassingly proportions and then they start crying foul and cheats, thus leading some of them to download cheats, because Instant Gratification has been denied. 


If you really want to save yourself much unwanted frustration and keep you sanity, Forget this game and play Valorant. Play any other game. This game is dying for real players looking for legit matches to play. The game is only kept alive due to cheaters, smurfs, and the skins market. Take away the skins market and watch this game crash like the Greek economy.",FALSE

Don't get me wrong though, there are positives to this game. It's simple to start with, but if you wish there is a lot to learn and a lot of tac involved.

Maybe to you these things outweigh the negatives, to me though; while you can certainly get your hours worth with this game, in hindsight it's a game I really wish I never started or bought. And I certainly wouldn't reccommend it to a friend. The ratio of enjoyment to sheer frustration with this game is pretty poor, whether you're good or bad at it.

even things that cant be ruined like the community (funny stupid, helpful basterds -annoying mother russia fucktards [i loved russins before], scammers everywhere that only want the thing that probably ruined the game so much-SKINS! fucking costy painting pices of shit that all the internt bet on now just to get more money or and eventuly knifes, and dont let me even start about those fucking knifes, not for the fact that the lowest priced one is 60$ atleast but what it done to the game and the community with this skins. before all of this we were just picking some random servers on 1.6 or source and play for hours of fan in wierd cool custom servers with awesome and gamemodes, only now to be a quick match of bullshit boring casual. now theres this new thing, and i dont mean gloves i mean that competitve mode, now its nice and all it execaly give something fresh and new to the series, but it turned everyone playing and my friends to a road to global addicts with the ranking network, it became so importent to just play to stay in your rank and get a better one rather then having some fun playing the game. this is like ripoff of CounterStrike beacuse it had so many things put to it and updates that the updates were for the updates, lol what did i just said there? 
anyway, i just know that from the game that every rage kid have to a casino to lose all your money by just playing it.

Still no 128 tick servers, and the latency is still very bad. It's 2020, but apparently Valve is stuck in 2010.
Anti-cheat got effectively replaced by a trust system, which is actually working. So thumbs up here.
The e-sports scene is being handled rather poorly, thankfully the scene doesn't need Valve.
Breaking competitive maps and being rigid about them is still the case though. So while they don't put the time in to manage the scene, they force them to play after their rules. They'd rather don't interfere with the map pool and leave good maps as old Cobblestone alone, but oh well. It's Valve after all. Old Nuke was better as well. Communication and development are basically inexistent, but it's CS, so it's expected.

Only recommended for people with a high frustration tolerance. The rest plays Fortnite and cohorts. Apex got really good as well btw. And Valorant is around the corner.",FALSE

What I found was deepley troubleing, and I was outraged to find that CS:GO had no sprays. This filled my mind with bewilderment as I pondered how they could even call this a CS game without porn sprays. Despite this I continued into my first game, yet was quick to find that no one was veiwing porn in anyway. Their was no platform for view porn what so ever! At first I thought that this must be a mistake, or this server must be broken. However further investigation lead to the same conclusion ""CS:GO"" has no porn. Infact the closest the game came to porn was a few of the players furiously masturbating over their coulourful knives. After a few hours of playing lied defeated on the sand, my balls where now blue after not having masturebated to CS:Source sprays in almost 5 hours. My gun was without  colour and the very clothes of my back had been scammed of me. So with shame I left the game, to have a wank.

3541,"TLDR - The game is not great. Only but it to play with friends since the community is extremely toxic. I played this game for the competitive aspect since there's no other game that comes close competitive wise to play. Sadly, this is still the only competetive FPS game that is popular at the moment. 

    Alright soooo if you liked playing the Counter Strike franchise then you probably will like this game. HOWEVER, if you are a competitive player and like the skill gap in FPS games then this game MIGHT NOT be the game for you. Let me explain...

    In Counter Strike 1.6 and Source there was more development into the games and there were not as many changes to the game that could risk making the game un-balanced. With CS:GO there are ROUGHLY 5 people working on CS:GO. This means that there's very little input from an experienced developing team and more from the community. Since the addition to Matchmaking it gave a lot of newcomers the chance to play more competitive but still be playing casually. This of course increased the amount of people who aren't as experienced as some competitive players explaing what should be added/removed/changed to the game.

    At it's current state, CS:GO has decent balance but is being abused FREQUENTLY and it's super easy with certain weapons and everytime they update the game that changes weapon stats, they tend to break something and make it extremely overpowered (Revolver, CZ75-Auto, AUG, SG).

    Another HUGE point to why this game is not very well handled, is that with Valve's extremely large amount of money, they don't support higher ""tick"" servers. This also of course has a limit based on graphics and what the server has to handle. In Counter Strike:Source the servers were 100 ticks compared to the now 64 ticks servers in CS:GO. This means that CS:S reads roughly 40% more shots than in CS:GO. Professional servers have 128 ticks servers which are by far the best tick rate at the moment. Professional servers are also for people more serious but 100% difference between casual and professional (OUTSIDE OF VALVE SERVERS) gameplay is almost rediculous. Atleast have it back to 100 ticks. (128 tick servers possible now with the china MM server having 128tick?)

    The methodical updates for CS:GO from Valve are not methodical. There are many different reddit posts explaining how screwed Valve is with updating their game. One patch they'll add tons of skins and a new operation when there's been uproar about how stupid or overpowered or rediculous something is. Then, you'll get an update to fix hitboxes. PRAISE VAL- Oh what's this? They added animations in the same patch? Did i forget to mention that these animations BREAK gameplay and allow you to be completely hidden from an enemy if positions and moved correctly? Yea that's a thing. But wait, they fixed it in this patch. Too bad that patch fixed ONE aspect of it (crouching) and at first broke the game even more by allowing you to jump higher than normal, but then was fixed.

    It seems like the game could be actually the best FPS shooter to be COMPETITIVELY played in history but they just want the game to be played how they want it to be. Props to them for making a game how they want it which is the reason to make games but allowing pistols to be able to run and be accurate is retarded. Trying to fix spraying with rifles and half way fixing pistols in one patch, to then just be ruined because their statistics were still showing people were still spraying (no shit because all you need to do is buff tapping, which you finally did later on) so they just reverted the whole patch. This was probably a YEAR ago and still no revisitation for the pistol update.

    Some people might think, ""Valve is just trying to release smaller patches and get ready for the source 2 port for CS:GO."" There are a couple of things wrong with this mentality. The first is that it's assuming Valve wants to port the game so soon and not continue making millions of cash through skins. The next is that even though it's been over a year since Source 2 was released AND Valve has already tested new features with Dota 2 (don't get me started), the gap from those tests to now is a huge gap and only recently is it possible for the port. Now if they were to make a NEW CS then that means skins would be dropped in price and then you'd just have new skins in the new CS but that also would mean that people would have to buy new skins and have faith that it won't become just another CoD series and that won't happen. What if they make it free to play? Cheater will be EVERYWHERE because of Valve's poor but decent enough with their baby protection Anti-Cheat. If there's a port to the Source 2 engine for CS, my guess is that they'll just overhaul this current game. If they don't, they'll probably have less people wanting to buy skins and still make more money from the game purchase. Until the game is fixed it's boring to watch tournaments with all the asine crap that happens. Make the skill ceiling HIGHER NOT LOWER you idiots at Valve.

---This is obviously biased to hating the game but I put why and went into some depth. Take this SERIOUSLY and have a good day playing a game you'll have FUN playing.

Edit: Game is still poorly unbalanced with the pistols, run and gun, jump shooting, and spraying. Just increase running inaccuracy for all weapons, decrease accuracy with jumping, increase tapping accuracy and it'd be a better game.

Edit: Added paragraphs about updates, pistols, Source 2 port, and fixed things with updated gameplay

Edit: Used to play competetively and now only play with friends. Still wouldn't recommend to anyone being serious.

-Most part of the community in this game is rude and cruel.
-There are lots of smurfs, which are basically players that buy new steam accounts with CS:GO just to play competitive gamemode against lower ranks. This will make you find players that play way better than you but they are on the same rank as you because they are using their smurf accounts.
-The Valve Anti-Cheat (VAC) doesn't seem to work because you can find cheaters almost in every single game.
-The Hit Detection is pretty ridiculous. Sometimes you shoot to the enemy and it doesn't register, other times you shoot to the ground and you kill the enemy with an headshot. Some people call this recoil, but recoil moves your gun and not only the bullets like it happens in this game. When you spray in this game, if you aim to the ground, the bullets will go up but the gun will be aiming the ground like if the barrel was bent.

I mean they developed the hitboxes that we know at the moment for 2 YEARS and now are doing ABSOLUTELY NOTHING to fix the game in its current broken state.

3586,"[h1]Game is getting worse and worse by the second.[/h1]
[i]You most likely already know what Counter Strike is, but in case you dont, heres a fast summary of a set of game rules that have been around since 8th of november, 2000.[/i]

Counter Strike: Global Offensive, better known as CS:GO is a 5vs5 competitive FPS where the objective for one team (T, or Terrorists) is to plant a bomb at a set location (one of two) while the other team (CT, or Counter Terrorists) has to defend and incase of the bomb being planted, defuse the bomb within a set timeframe.

[h1]State of the game[/h1]
[i]Counter Strike: Global Offensive used to be a game about the competitive aspect of a FPS, however that time is over, heres why.[/i]

Valves anti cheat is simply too bad for new players, theres a couple of different types of match making, however the objective is the same.

[b]MM (non prime):[/b] 
MM (Match making) is Valves version of competitive, requires being level 2 to join, however it'll be filled with cheaters and smurfs, which is gonna ruin the experience for any new player.

[b]MM (prime):[/b] 
Same as non prime, but with less obvious cheaters and smurfs, since it requires your account to be level 21 which does take quite a while. The anti-cheat right now is so bad that anyone is able to make a very simple cheat that wont get detected without too much effort.

[b]CEVO:[/b] 
I've got no experience with this service so I wont comment too much on it. From what I've heard its very close to being the same experience as normal Match making.

[b]FACEit (free/paid):[/b] 
Again, I've got very little experience with Faceit, they've got a better anti-cheat, its possible to play on it for free, however it has limitations if you dont pay the monthly fee. Its not very ""new-player-friendly"" because the skill level on here is a lot higher compared to normal Match making.

[b]ESEA (paid):[/b] 
Better anti-cheat but! I paid for ESEA 1 month and got ranked at a somewhat decent level (B), this was one of the worst experiences I've ever had with the game. People on ESEA take the game very serious, and they will get very angry with you if you make mistakes. Its not very ""new-player-friendly"" because the skill level on here is a lot higher compared to normal Match making.

[h1]Greedy bastards[/h1]
[i]One meme is that Valve only cares about money, they have yet to disprove this[/i]

[b]Every now and then Valve will release another case or operation.[/b]
A case will cost you $2.5 to open and will grant you a weapon/knife skin which (most likely) is gonna be worthless, or something worth thousands of $ (So its gambling in-game).

Operations will cost you $5 and give you a set of missions / objectives to complete, these can be quite fun if you team up with a friend and will also grant you random skins from the current case.

[b]Long story short[/b], match making is ruined by cheaters, Valve doesnt care, if you're a new player you're gonna have a bad time, if you're easily addicted to gambling heres more to spend your money on.",FALSE

3588,"Так, я знаю что уже овердофига людей написали насколько CS:GO скатилась и стала вообще основным местом обитания читеров. Даже засрали уже F2P механику данного творения, и есть за что. [spoiler] Помимо этого засрали Battle Royale который уже всех с*** задолбал. Есть чёртовы PUBG и Fortnite [/spoiler]

[h1] Пишу я данный обзор, так как играл в эту игру ещё в годы её расцвета (2015-2016), когда в ней не бушевали читеры, игра реально отбивалась и не была ЧИСТОЙ выкачкой денег с наших кошельков.

Я буду конкретно засирать данное творение, и этот обзор будет чисто субъективным, поэтому либо готовьте свой мозг к моральному изнасилованию, или же просто не принимайте всё это близко к сердцу если вы фанат данного творения. [/h1] 
Что ж, приступим.

1. Операции.

Да, довольно простой пункт. Учитывая что контент каждый операции - сомнительный, так ещё последняя операция Hydra была ещё хер знает когда. В итоге: новый контент - это MP5SD [spoiler] это хоть что-то стоящее на самом деле, так как я фанат MP5 в CS:S и MP5SD из R6:S и CoD4:MW [/spoiler], и самое главное, ТОННЫ СКИНОВ. Cамое забавное, на просьбы ребаланса и багфиксов у нас просто молчание. 

Итог: Сомнительный контент, который ещё себя кастрировал со временем, и х***ый Feedback от Valve.

2. Комьюнити и читеры.

Я не буду сравнивать комьюнити контры с каким-нибудь F2P куском кода (по типу Warface, PB и т.п.). Я абстригируюсь от этого и напишу прямо - [b] Токсичность наше всё [/b] (с) Девиз каждого фаната этой игры. Серьёзно, в MM тебя готовы засирать когда ты на последнем месте, а потом БАЦ-БАЦ, ты уже на первым. А те челики тебя дальше срут, а потом ещё напишут под профилем что ты у**бок.
Фиг с этим, данных сверхразумов можно заглушить. Но вы уже знаете что нельзя потушить после встречи с читером. Единственное что может хоть немного потушить ваш пылающий зад - это извещение о бане игрока, которого вы зарепортили (и то не факт).

Итог: Токсичное комьюнити (сразу скажу, не все игроки такие, я называю общую часть) и обилие читеров.

3. Последнее обновление Danger Zone и F2P история с Prime-Status.

О да, +1 обзор в копилку Valve про это шикарное обновление. Знаете, мне кажется что какой-то геймдизайнер просто узнал о Battle Roayle и успешности Epic Games и PUBG Entertainment, и захотели так же. К сожилению, Battle Roayle из 18 человек - не Battle Royale. А ещё вместо лутинга (хотя он частично есть), к вам будут прилетать дроны. [spoiler] ДРОНЫ, МАТЬ ЕГО КАРЛ. С КОРОБКАМИ. [/spoiler] А ещё они вас пиздец как палят. Так что, Battle Roayle - Никудышный, и лишь очередная попытка Valve попасть на уже стихшую волну хайпа 2к17 года.
Ух, а вот F2P - это что-то с чем-то. Мало того что читеров и так дохуя на праймах, теперь их ещё стало в раз 3-4 больше! [spoiler] Мечтал об этом всю жизнь вольво. Спасибо огромное [/spoiler]. А для тех кто платил 449 руб. (и меньше), они получают прайм и без мобилки (отсюда и кучу читеров будет на прайме) и сранный значок. Извините, я лучше верну деньги за это и буду сидеть на F2P основе, если вообще буду играть в данную игру.

Если я хочу нормальную F2P игру - то TF2 в студию, там хотя бы токсиков меньше, как и потных трайхардов на казуалах (ибо там компетитив - мёртвый, хех)./


Ну видимо всё. Высрал своё субъективное мнение. Соглашаться, несоглашаться с ним - решать вам. Однако скажу точно - игра умирает, той CS:GO которой она была в 2015-2016 я больше не увижу и не прочувствую. Жаль, на этой ноте для меня CS:GO уходит из жизни.",FALSE

The game is also littered with hackers, and smurfs, often ruining the experience for others. Furthermore, in many of the games that I play, I often get told to ""kill myself"" and ""neck myself"", which I find absolutely disgusting. I always attempt to be nice to my teammates, and encouraging, but even that cannot prevent the pure toxicity of the game's community.

MGE down to nova 2 beacuse of Smurfers, Shit servers, Hackers or people that were boosted

The cons outway the amout of pros on this game, Literly the only reason this game has any players whats so ever is beacuse of hopw large the community is, This game used to be fun but now its just shit like a very bad shit with fucking lacsatives.

When will steam fix all these issues, most likly never beacuse they have turned into cod making crap loads of DLC and not bothering about fixing the game first.

3634,"Counter-Strike used to be a fantastic game with a fantastic community. I spent many hours on this game either playing competitive with friends or meeting new people in public lobbies. Rarely would I encounter cheaters and, when I did, there was a community consensus to kick them. 

It's completely different now. Counter-Strike is completely infested with cheaters, new and old. The ability to simply download any rage hack you want, join a competitive lobby and steamroll the other team has completely ruined the competitive aspect of the game for myself and others alike. 

Valve has let this game turn into a complete disgrace.",FALSE
3635,"This game is terrible but fun, the vac anti-cheat is the worst anti-cheat you will ever see, if you have a low trust factor you will play against a lot of cheaters and if you haven't bought prime you'll basically be against a cheater every single time.
The valve server break all the time, you can't join your friend sometimes, can't reconnect back to matches ext.

There is nothing innovative about a game with a severe cheating problem and the only response a company has is shadow bans in a poor attempt to wash away the cheaters (but its on sale for 3$ every few months).  

Update Valve still hasnt fixed their cheating problem this game is just used as a deathmatch.  Have to depend on a third party to have a fair game.

Trust factor is literally ""shadow banning"" you because of your social status in the game and it has nothing to do with cheating.  The cheaters get OW, they get banned and they buy another copy meanwhile the dude who is suspected or may have done some smurfing....That persons trust factor is so low you cannot find a game without a cheater or people who just straight throw a game to make people mad.  Oh and if your friend is a troll and youre queued with them...Your trust factor suffers.

This is a system that promotes bull and as long as youve got the coin to grab another copy of prime its OK with valve for you to come back and cheat again.

Let's do a simple thought experiment: imagine us two standing in front of each other. I, of course, am wearing a pair of jeans, that are covering my genitals and my butt. You then command me to ""go fuck myself"". I may be fucking myself already. I may as well not be fucking myself already. Until my dick and its position relative to my ass is observed, it is simultaneously in my ass, but also outside of it - thus, it stays in superposition. The moment you lay eyes on my penis, both states collide with each other and become either one. You may have already guessed what the problem here is. As soon as a single photon reflected by my dick enters either one of your eyes, you become gay. The only way to avoid this is to not observe my penis. But if you don't look at it, then you will never know if your insult had any effect, thus rendering it meaningless.

All around a good deal for a great game that might otherwise seem stale, given that many of the maps have been around for over 10 years.

This version plays a lot like CS 1.0, for those who can remember that far back. 1.0 was fairly different from 1.3, which was again fairly different from 1.6. But yeah, this is a very nice iteration of CS in my opinion, so 8/10 from me.

It's been a long time since that review. I have to add: hax + toxicity. And toxicity + hax. And more hax. Oh, and add some toxicity on top. If you tell your teammates to stop using their wallhax, chances are the entire team is reporting YOU for cheating in retaliation.

3655,"[h1] [b] This review is for casual gamers and not competitive gamers. [/b] [/h1]

[i] As a gamer I recommend games that: are fun to play, help relax the mind, tell great stories, make the player philosophy, and aspire challenge. However, I cannot recommend a game when it creates an enviornment that compromoses these principles and fissures our moral codes. [/i]

[h1] The Worst of CSGO [/h1]

[olist]

[*] CSGO has the worst player community on Steam / Reddit
- It's really no secret just how bad the CSGO community is; The players can be extremely racist, sexist, abusive, vulgar, and obnoxious. The toxicity can be seen in player profiles with racist/sexist/""meme"" usernames, avatars, groups, etc. 

- The Steam discussion section and Reddit page aren't any better; it's best to actually avoid any forums that talk about CSGO.

[*] CSGO is plagued with cheaters, griefers, and smurfs
- This is also a well known issue that has yet to be addressed by Valve. CSGO's competative is swamped with: cheaters who use scripts and cheat engines; griefers who throw games and harass other players; and smurfs who demoralize new players. 

- As of the date of this review (6/16/2016), the Prime Beta is on going. However, it isn't evident if Prime with solve the issue with cheaters and surely won't solve the issue with griefers and smurfs.

[*] CSGO's ranking system is broken
- If your in any silver rank, you know exactly what im talking about. Valve recently changed the ranking system in order to reduce the number of ""Global Elite"" ranked players in competative. Unfortunately, their actions also congested the starting competative ranks of silver, making it extremely difficult to rank out of silver, progress in skill, or enjoy competative with people of your same skill level. 

-compound this issue with the above problems, and you have CSGO matchmaking in a nutshell.

[/olist]

[h1] Conclusion [/h1]

[i] CSGO is an extremely competative game that throws away common decency for the sake of what some can call ""fun"". If your a casual gamer or someone who is new to video games, avoid this game completely; This game will be completely frustrating and devoid of fun for casual players and drive away new players from the medium of video games. 

- For casual players and new players I would recommend: the Battlefield series, Arma series, DOOM, Chivalry, Team Fortress 2, Garry's Mod, Sniper Elite series, and / or Overwatch. [/i]",FALSE

I have to tell this my story while CS:GO. I didn't play CSGO 2 months ago because **** updates.
Well, today I started to play Competitive Match with my 2 friends. And we met 2 normal guys.
Later, one from us was very toxic and helped for Griefing. We wanted to kick him, nope.
He had one boyfriend, so the boyfriend didn't accept for vote kick, very funny.
And they wanted kick to us, and they disbelieved about griefing. They can get VAC BAN.
I warned them, and they disbelieved. So we did report ""Griefing"". And my friend was angry,
wanted to stop play in match. So he did like fake AFK. And they killed to my friend. So I
started to kick my friend, because my friend didn't want to play on this match. 
And I had AWP on T SPAWN. Asshole told him CT where I'm... So I killed to the asshole. 
Later, I was sniping to CT door and asshole did stay with me and go to my aim. So I killed him. 
And enjoy cooldown. I was happy. But this game is not for me funny. 
Ago 1 year was very good game, but now no.

Team Fortress 2 has a (barely held together) competitive scene which for the most is pretty decent, I've been playing my first season of competitive and found the majority of stuff to work out great.

CS:GO has the competitive matchmaking built into the game which is a huge blessing for any competitive player, I even hope TF2 can learn from this at some point and follow in CS:GO's footsteps.

When it comes to the actual community though, I find that TF2 has a much kinder and laid back community (of course it has it's exceptions like any game). CS:GO on the other hand from what I've seen so far and heard seems to mainly consist of rude players who have little tolerance for newcomers. I'm not sure what causes this (most likely the huge audience), but it defiantly turns someone away like me who hates getting into arguements/dealing with morons.

At the end of the day it's a great and popular game ruined by a terrible community. I know I'll probably get a lot of hate on this review since many people love this game, but I just figured I'd let newcomers know what they're getting themselves into.

Tired of reporting the maladjusted abuseives not to mention dirt bag hackers and not knowing if it's to any avail. Tirend of even seeing the word c**t in players names (homestly how hard is it to filter that?)

I used to play this game to unwind. Now all i do is feel quite disturbed that this is somehow an acceptable environment for young minds to play in. I am no fan of the nanny state, but as a parent I would strongly recommed against this game for your child. 

Don't believe me? Buy the game, play for a few hours, listen to the banter and read the in game chat logs and find out what a ""welcoming"" community this is. 

I can no longer play this game in good conscience until such time Valve spends more time/effort on weeding out this sort of behaviour.

3788,"[h1][b]Counter Strike: Global Offensive - One Of The Worst Communities[/b][/h1]

[h1]Gameplay[/h1]
Gameplay is extremly arcady and not very realistic at all. But counter strike has never been known for being realistic as of such so that is okay. It's just more counter strike. One thing that i cannot stand however is that when you are being shot you can barely move only making it easier to be killed. God is it annoying! And before you come over and say ""Oh but that is realistic, because you would in real life"" that is an idiotic statement. Counter strike is an arcade shooter, it's not Rainbow Six: Siege.

[h1]Graphics[/h1]
It is not very good, obviosuly this game is old so it's fine. It's not important either since i play on lowest settings to get max FPS. And the game still looks fine to play. So it's nothing that matters at all.

[h1]Community[/h1]
...There is a reason as to why i usually stick to singleplayer games for the most part. And this games community is a perfect example as to why i do that. You have the fantastic pleasure of meeting sociopaths, racists, bullies, manchildren and people that take it way to seriously. Also prepare to hear extremly stupid garbage. From people making death threats towards you to people using homophobic slurs and other sorts of verbal abuse. There are more but i digress from continuing on. You get the point. 

Let me tell you of an experience that i had with a player.
I was playing a competetive match and i was doing alright, and i was also using my microphone in order to communicate with my team more efficiently. And out of the blue, one of the guys from my team asked me ""Hey, Red Panda, do you like anime?"" since he saw that my profile picture was anime related. I told him that i did, and he told me that was really gay and that i was a faggot for liking it. Now it isn't the first time that has happened to me, and it wont be the last. I don't care either. People are ignorant morons that always need a good jerkin by trash talking other people for something they like. Anyways, he basically taunted me the whole match, and insulted me with whatever he could. He even went over to my profile to see it only so he could say how gay it looked. And remember that he asked me if i liked anime. It's not like i said anything mean to him. 

That is only one of my experiences with complete human trash in this game. You can also be in danger of just being kicked from the match just because someone doesn't think that you live up to ""Their Standards"" as a player, which is annoying. Or you can also get teamkilled at times on purpose.   

[h1]Conclusion[/h1]
I get why this game is so popular, even to this day. I mean it's really addictive in some ways. But come on....The gameplay is not that great at all, the community is one of the worst i have ever seen, heard and experienced and the game is not even that tactical. You would be way better of by just buying Rainbow Six: Siege instead. If you get off from being insulted in every way possible and possibly have your life threatened then this is the game for you, if not don't touch it with a 20 feet pole.

The game has always had hackers and people generally just trying to ruin the experience, but F2P will only worsen this as banning people will do absolutely NOTHING. Furthermore, F2P won't really increase the playerbase an awful lot - anyone already interested in PC gaming would either already have the game, or already have intentions of buying it once they got a PC.

I don't see ANY potential in the battle royale mode, its just trash to be honest. Not well thought out, not a great map, and has blatantly just been thrown together as a gimmick. Disappointed.

Finally, even if the F2P does increase the playerbase, I can't imagine it will do ANYTHING to extend the lifespan of the game which has been noticably shrinking across the past couple years.

3833,"*TL;DR Pros and Cons list in the bottom* Also had more thoughts, but forgot some while writing. I may edit in later if I care enough to roast this game some more.

I used to think this game was great, hell, I sunk in literally over three thousand hours over four short years. It's because of this game that I've met some great people, some I still know now, some I don't. This game used to be a great deal of fun, between custom maps, community modes, and of course, the ranked matchmaking system, with a ladder suited for my very competitive needs. It had some great things I enjoyed in a game, a shooter without story to bore me, and action to deal with, mechanics that are easy to learn, but hard to master, team play that could strengthen (or in some sad cases, break) bonds with friends. However, it wasn't until recently I realized what a waste of time that was, and here's why. The lack of care and support from a very dedicated development team. 

What happened to my good days as a young laddy playing TF2, with its constant flow of new, (mostly) free content? What happened to the same early days of CS:GO, with its addition of operations to shake up the same boring map pool up some more? What about the overall fixes? Now, CS hasn't seen much good patches. Instead of polishing the game's many imperections (the main ones I shall list later), Valve seems to focus on makin' skins for makin' money.

Throughout my years of CS, I've traded a lot. I've made a good amount of money and cashed a fair bit out and gifted the rest, I can't just take the skins for granted. However, what has become very apparent is that Valve seems to put more care into their skins than the well being of their game. Various features that the community has asked for have been neglected from competitive rules in a non-ranked (""casual"") format, higher tick rate servers, or, to an actually decent anti-cheat. The last two points are the main two that drove me from this game. Instead of getting a good anti-cheat going, Valve pushes out skins and game-breaking guns, such as the original CZ and R8. It just seems so stupid and kind of lazy that THIRD-PARTY SITES, such as ESEA and Faceit, have not just higher tick servers, but BETTER ANTI-CHEAT than the OWNERS of the game.

Then there's the operations, which barely seem to exist anymore, which just makes the gameplay dull and repetitive. We had the map de_season return for two operations in a row, I think three operations total. People thought Season was coming back into the competitive map pool. What did we get instead? A removal of maps (that I probably wouldn't have played) and the addition of Agency. I may not have played maps like Militia, but now the menu just feels baren.

To prove how little Valve cares about their game and players, they added a hold on items and their ability to be traded after being received, effectively killing trading for a large majority of people, especially when making an item-to-key (currency for traders that is at a stable $2.5) slow and practically not worth it, as it also makes the trading more gambly when dealing in very shaky prices.

TL;DR Pros and Cons
Pros: 
-Easy to get into, hard to master
-Great timesucker (can be a con, too)
-Very competitive game for competitive people, with non-competitive modes and community modes
-An economy for traders (also a con, too)
-Can possibly help you find some new friends, I guess, but any game can do that
-Pretty cheap
-Runs on total trash computers

Cons:
-Can have longer matches than you may be willing to deal with
-Competitive ranked ladder that sometimes may seem like it's screwing you, but that may be a biased out look
-Economy for gambling sites (that were previously shut down and have somehow come back, showing the lack of care from Valve)
-Cheap, meaning cheaters can come back
-May run on trash PCs, but higher FPS players will probably dominate. You may not believe it, but FPS is a large ruling factor in some very fast-paced gun fights
-The cheaters because of the terrible anti-cheat
-The terrible hit registration, made apparent by the higher tick rate third party servers
-The lacking care of support
-The lack of new content to shake things up
-Gets very dull quickly, which you may not expect to hear from someone with 3 thousand+ hours
-Pretty toxic, unforgiving community (especially random teammates). Not as bad as LoL, but certainly close. Don't post opinions on Reddit unless you're ready for hate
-Cheap for smurf accounts",FALSE

3844,"Oh boy, have i waited to review this one. 70 hours in, all achievements.

First of all, lets start by clearing up some doubts. No, the game is not a souls-like just because it looks like code vein. In fact, the only similarity are the aesthetics. I say it because I've seen many people confused about this. Also, i don't even know why i should be saying this, but the game does not have any kind of fan service AT ALL. So don't start playing with the wrong ideas.

So what kind of game is Counter strike: Global offensive?
Well, it's more of an JRPG. A mix of a Visual novel and an action packed game. It means, you will most of the time learn what the story is about through dialogues. Whereas the combat part, works as an entertaining way of accessing the new dialogue and part of the story.
The battle segments are quite linear and straight forward, but you will be able to free roam a bit. Meaning you will be able to go back to places you have already visit, most of the times at least. Also a thing worth mentioning is that, you will have teammates but they serve mostly as support, so don't expect them to do anything besides healing you sometimes. The game also provides you with the so called ""Stand by"" phases, where you can give gifts, interact and bond with your friends, in order to upgrade their skills and to have character events.
Finally, there are two main characters, each with their own perspective of the same story. It does not matter which one you pick first, you will then be able to pick the other and start a new game plus, keeping all objects and levels you earned on the first playtrough. Normally, some cutscenes will be the same, specially when both MCs are together, however you can sometimes hear their thoughts, which will add some difference to it.

Now let's break it down a bit. This part will be based purely on my experience with the game.

1) The story.
I think it's actually pretty good. Emotional and interesting, one of the best aspects of the game.

2) Combat system.
The strongest and greatest side of Counter strike: Global offensive by far. It's extremely fun. You are able to perform different attack variations combining environmental objects and some really nice skills that your teammates have to offer.
Now, you are able to pick up to two companions to have with you, but you are able to use all friend skills, whether they are in the party or not.

3) Side-quests and free roam.
As i said before, you will be able to free roam a bit. Now, it is pretty much useless, unless you are going for a 100% completion. Free roam allows you to grind XP and to accept side-quests. Talking of which, they are absolutely trash. SQ are the worst aspect of the game. Many of them are extremely stressful and the rewards are not even worth it, except you want that 100%.

4) Bonding and gifts.
In my opinion, this is actually good. It lets you discover some of your friends past in a fun way. And bonding levels don't require too much grinding, so it is not something painful to do. A few gifts will usually do the trick (bonding goes up to level Global Elite).

5) Visuals and soundtracks.
You can search for a quick video on how it looks. It's anime themed so don't expect awesome graphics. But it does look good. Soundtracks are quite good, nothing really awesome but all in all good.

6) Customization.
Not many different outfits at the moment. But there are a ton of add-ons you can put on all character which actually look pretty nice.

7) Bugs.
Honestly i don't remember having any issues with the game. Only one crash. Besides that, no problems at all.

8) Key binding.
I played with a controller, i believe it's more comfortable this way. Many games like this usually have trash keyboard binding. But i can't really tell.

I think that sums up pretty much everything. Personally i loved the game and i can easily recommend it. But you have to be sure what kind of game you are buying first.

Extra Information:
Its safe to say that it'll take me a long time to get 1.3k hours. Let me elaborate. CS:GO is not the game it used to be. Ever since the free update it seems like there are quadruple the amount of cheaters and smurfs then before. I can't seem to find a game without atleast one person completely dominating at the top of the leaderboard. It's just not fun anymore. Dropping CS:GO for other games like Rainbow Six saved me a lot of stress and at this point of the game I just feel like it is a chore to play. I believe the game could come back from the dead if they introduce better anti cheat and punish high level smurfs from playing/throwing competitive games. The E-Sports side of this game has been milked for all its worth and Valve effectively killed Weapon Skin value by introducing the 7 day trade hold.

3862,"After years of playing this game and a lot of money spent on skins and cases, having approximately 4000h in my 2 accounts combined, I have to say I had to uninstall it.

I had not played CS:GO in 3 months before this review because I was tired of the amount of cheaters I was playing against (I have a prime account and my rank was Legendary Eagle/Legendary Eagle Master).

I spent those 3 months playing Rainbow Six Siege a game which I disregarded for a lot of time because I prefered CS:GO over it, and I still do when it comes to the gameplay itself.

So, today, I thought, I'm gonna give CS:GO another chance and so, me and my friend queued up, and, I swear to god, in our very first game we get an HvH situation. I left mid game and uninstalled CS:GO right away.

I love this game, but I cannot recommend it until it gets a decent enough anticheat (and 128 tick servers would be nice as well!)

It really saddens me that I can't play the game I love the most, but this is the truth, in its current state, CS:GO regular matchmaking is unplayable, if you want to have a lesser chance of finding cheaters you need to go to FaceIt or similar platforms. Please Valve, set your skins and stickers aside for just a minute and give us a better anti-cheat. After that you can go right back to making money.

This decision finally confirmed that it's time for me to make a review on the game after spending 100+ hours in game.

I'm not sure if it's just bad luck or what but all i can say is that CSGO community is very toxic since every match i have played contains at least some form of racism, vulgar language in both text and audio through microphone, annoying fools screaming at mic and of course how could i forget damn cheaters! there's always a chance to encounter someone that is using a cheating tool.

Plus the most importantly there isn't any anti abusing system against people who are abusing the voting system. I got kicked multiple times on different modes, it's either due to some racist fools, or due to some butthurt group who refused to backup and in the end blaming me for the lost of the game =.= or even you're performing really well like the top scorer on the team there's a chance someone and his friends will abuse votekick feature to kick you out :(

Imagine you're enjoying your game and spent your time on racking up your score to level up and suddenly got kicked due to some butthurt fools abusing vote system and losing all your progress would be really devastating.

So yeah it definitely not recommended when you're planning on playing alone since as you can see, sadly i got gang bullied by idiots that are abusing the votekick system on me :(

I would like to see Valve doing something to improve on the problems that i have listed here in the future. Such as there will be a anti abusing system around the vote feature to stop fools and their friends from abusing the system. And i hope Valve's new anti cheat system will finally work this time around in all modes yes including Casual mode or else it's going to be Cheaters Strike Global Offensive for a long time =.= until all cheaters are filtered out completely!

[h1]TL;DR[/h1][spoiler]VALVe does not care about your gameplay, they care about your money.[/spoiler]

[h1]What's good[/h1]
[list]
[*]The core game idea, this game only needs some rough sanding
[*]CS:GO's overwatch feature is gud 10/10
[*]What you can buy is only a viagra for your ePenis; You can't buy yourself any advantages only shiny things and buttplugs [i](pun intended)[/i]
[*]voice_enable 0 - client sided command works perfectly, or for that hunded people muting players in the scoreboard
[/list]

[h1]What's bad in the game and they can't change it 100%[/h1]
[list]
[*]Smurfs
[*]Cheaters
[*]The communty itself
[/list]

[h1]What I think they should do to [i][b]make CS:GO great again[/b][/i]™[/h1]
[list]
[*]Better netcode
[*]Adding an option to report smurfs in overwatch
[*]Making communty competitive more pronounced
[*]Rework the ranking system by adding more ranks, not by raising the elo points
[*]Fake client accepts (9/10) to shorten waiting times
[*]Make random voting systems because if there's a server with 24 players about 6-8 will vote
[/list]

[h1]What I think they easily could have changed but just simply don't gave two shits[/h1]
[list]
[*]128 tick official servers or at least prime MM servers
[*]Implement a better anti-cheat system
[*]Age restriction for the market
[*]Dedicated servers for russia [i](That country is bigger than pluto and and does not have it's own servers smh)[/i]
[/list]

[h1]Conclusion[/h1]
[b]Don't buy this game full priced, It's just not worth it if you're only going to play competitive. The community is cancer with the spreading ability of herpes. There are russians, yes, no need to hate all of them because five people treated you like shit. You can have fun playing surf, jailbreak, or other modded servers that are far away from the official servers.[/b]

Not only is this game bad, the player community is filled with toxic 12 year old players and several males in their 20s believing themselves to be superior to this young children because of their age, and berate the kids in the most imbecilic ways imaginable. Weapon balancing is also horrid, the worst I have ever seen in a first person shooter. Some weapons just require a moderate rebalancing, but some weapons such as the auto sniper should just be entirely removed. And deathmatch, oh deathmatch. What is wrong with the spawn system? A significant factor determining one's position on the leaderboard is the spawns. Even if you're a skilled player, if you get bad spawn locations you will likely be spawn killed, and occasinally if you try to avoid spawn killing a player who is currently immune, you are killed as you are walking away. Of course even if you manage to avoid these problems, if you are unskilled you will not perform well during the match but a good player has a chance of overtaking a very good player who encounters these problems. It is a shame to see Valve fuck up this badly on deathmatch which is a crucial part of early csgo as it is one of three game modes available to you before you reach rank 3; in other words you almost need to play it to reach rank 3 and it is also likely the quickest way to reach rank 3.

4056,"I've determined that Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is from another dimension. It's a game that doesn't need to exist.

But here's GO: full of doppelganger Desert Eagles and de_dust déjà vu, quantum-leaping from some parallel timeline whose game industry briefly intersected with ours. Playing it is like running into a college crush at the supermarket. You immediately notice differences. Oh, you're married? Your hair looks different. But that experience of reconnecting is pleasant—they're mostly still the person you admired during geology.

In other words, GO's familiarity helps and hurts. Minor deviations from the CS you might've known or loved are easy to identify. The MP5 is now the MP7, but it lacks the same clicky report and underdoggy “this is all I can afford, please don't kill me” personality. The TMP is replaced by the MP9. Ragdoll physics don't persist after death, curiously. You can't attach a suppressor to the M4 for some reason.

I'm not particularly bothered by this stuff; I don't need the MP5 reproduced precisely as it existed in 2004 or 2000 to live a fulfilling life. What does bug me are some small but significant changes to firing feedback. When you shoot someone in GO, they don't wince. There's a sneeze of blood, and audio that conveys that you're hitting them if you're within a certain range. But they don't do this , and I don't understand the decision to omit a flinch animation on character models.",FALSE

to help fuel its toxisity and issues that have come that far that people are now starting to sue valve,
(and lets not even talk about the R8) the funny thing is that in the case that you are in matchmaking against a cheater you CANNOT LEAVE unless you want to recieve a ban from playing matchmaking for the next 30mins to 7 days.

even with friends or playing as mutch (1560 hours) as i did i have never ever enjoyed this game for more than 15 minutes everytime i try to play it. 

matchmaking in csgo is like going to chernobil and hugging the elephants foot naked, then going 1 step further by combining ebloa (toxic community) aids (64tick servers) zika (hitboxes/bugs) and the cancer (hackers/cheaters) that you recieved into a super disease and inject it into yourself like a hobo drug addict. 

yes there are some 3rd party sites that improve matchmaking like faceit or ESEA (which i highly recommend)
that improve certain aspects of the game like better anti-cheat system and 124 tick servers and even a less toxic community but for ESEA which is the best 3rd party platform you need to have a subscription the problem with that is that not everyone have the money to pay for a monthly subscription and are stuck inside the shithole matchmaking is.

Valve has taken steps to try and improve csgo by prime matchmaking (connecting your phone into the game-google if not sure), Overwatch bans and as last updage shown improving the crouch spawm exploit and landing after a jump exploit, but Valve has taken allmost to none steps to improve the community itself or the hacking problems we have, yes i know they are doing VAC waves here and then but its still not helping as a hacker that pays 15-30$ for cheats can allways buy cs again and again on different accounts if assumed he got VAC banned at all for example a friend of a friend was playing CS for well over a year now and has gained alot of hours in the game, one day about a month ago he told me he got vac banned and admitted to using radar hacks that let you see the enemy team on the radar at all times. he admitted to using the hack since he started playing cs and was only vac banned about a year later.
more of these cases can be seen throughout the internet.
Vlave can easily fix this reocurring issue just by issuing Hardware bans which just ban you completely from the game even on other accounts and improving the VAC system to be 1 step ahead at all times, or fixing the server side issues by just re adding the 124 tick servers, and fix other game issues by just listening to the community. 
I belive that the counterstrike team should have some communication with the public at some point to some degree atleast if they want to actually succeed and make cs potentially one of the greatest games in the world. 
but instead they focus on other things such as new sounds and skins that make Valve more money. 

I recommend not buying this game unless you can afford ESEA or just interested in skins.

For some it worked, and worked well. Others, you literally threw them in a pool of cheaters and toxic players with no real way of escape, ultimately making them toxic or just want to leave the game altogether. If that wasn't enough, you've gone and chased a trend that should have nothing to do with CS:GO, made it free to play AND the ability to purchase prime, pretty much eliminating the purpose of prime in the first place? A lot of cheaters these day's don't care about how much they spend, they will literally sign up for a new account, buy prime, and cheat their hearts away, ruining it for others. I guess that's what you want though, more money.

I genuinely think this ""Danger Zone"" update has killed CS:GO for real this time. Apparently it was ""already dying"" according to some people, but this really is the arrow through the heart now.

they get their account gaining prime status which may i add a lot of people already have.

my laptop gives me only 30 fps but it gets worse after another not optimized updates.
after the release of valorant the valve just started the shattered web operation and dropped 2 weapon cases and ofc they fixed some bugs but they weren't that much consequential.
the prime matches are not perfectly prime, there is always at least one nonprime player in one of the sides.
the ranking system is terrible, sometimes I'm playing with a bunch of silvers against a bunch of LEMs.
sometimes I'm playing with some globals in wingman who they are pretty super and sometimes the globals play like a Silver and you can win that game like 9-0.

Now while csgo's BR is not my cup of tea it is unique and that's all it really has going for it. and that's also not saying much since game like fortnite can also be considered unique with it's building and colourfull artstyle.

Even though the cheaters get banned, it still doesn't make any difference since it still ruins your competitive matches mood and rank wise. The community of the CS:GO is pretty toxic nowadays, you're having hard time with kiddo's almost all the time. Also the player quality has decreased overall, your teammates can be terrible.

The graphics are not the strong side of CS:GO since the game got released on 2012. The development process is long if you want to play really nice.

For the entire day of January Second 2017, and part of late January 1'st 2017, no one has been able to play any Competitive matches, deathmatches, or check their wins or rank! A lot of people are affected by this, some of which bought this game during the steam sale. Yet, through all of this, Valve says nothing. All they are going to do is change another sound in the game, or make another case. Maybe for once they could use their huge pile of money to actually improve the game! Give us 128 Tick servers, fix VAC, fix the hitboxes, fix the animations, and for god's sake do something with this game. I've played this game for over three years on multiple levels, however I'm finding that with how Valve says nothing when their own game isn't working for two days to be  unbelievable and unacceptable, and for that reason I'm considering quitting the game for good. 



  It's been a love hate relationship with this game since I got it. The broken hitboxes, the pointless sound changes and new cases, and worst of all, the cheaters. Cheaters are everywhere in this game. You would think that Valve would fix their own Anti-Cheat system. They won't. I think they should at least IP ban people who get a VAC ban multiple times on their IP address. Although it can be bypassed, it would stop some cheaters who ruin the game....

4215,"Game is full of hackers,",FALSE
4216,"I've been kind of doing a circuit on reviews so I guess I'll include CS:GO, the game on steam I have (by far) the most hours in. Where to start...

This was the first CS I really played. I played source back when HL2 came out as it was the 'official multiplayer' for it (and I played a little of the previous one in lan parties), but I was very unimpressed. I was coming in from playing Rainbow Six 3: Raven Shield, a much more tactical and better made shooter, and I saw little merit to counter strike. Fast forward to what... about 2 years ago now? My best friend got CS:GO, we played, and I said 'sure, why not'.

Next thing I knew I played on to 1700 hours while he quit substantially sooner. For the first 1k hours I had a blast: there were skins to get, ranks to achieve, teams that I had to organize into a fighting force to win the match. I had a lot of great matches and a lot of shitty ones, but overall it was just a blast. Sometimes the funnest moments are when your team is full of horrible trolls, you flame them, mute them, then carry them with troll strats and just laugh all the way. Then I kept going for no discernible reason. 

Was it the huge friends list I got from this game? partially, some people kept bugging me to play and I would relent, and some people I really did enjoy playing with. Was it the game itself? Also partially, as I too got hooked to the appeal of this game, which is getting really good at really shitty aiming mechanics and repetetive maps. I never got into the lording yourself over your opponent part though. Was it the social element? Also partially, as I had many fun conversations with randoms and many, many hilarious moments with my teams (even in matches full of trolls).

I also got hooked on a specific technique: the thing I mastered in this game was the NOVA shotgun. I would always use it, every round, as in buying from 2nd round on, bathing in the tears of my team as they urged, ""NO DON'T BUY YOU NOOB! OUR ECONOMYYYY!!!!"" But then I'd be the one doing all the buying for my team and getting those sick NOVA aces, and even though I rarely got recognition it was awesome, cuz I knew how stupid they were.

But ultimately this game, though it was fresh for me, is just perpetuating the legacy of a janky old shooter before they could design proper shooting mechanics. It's a nostalgia trip. Explain to me how trained operatives can't aim down sights, or at least be good enough with their weapons to get a few shots where they're aiming?!?! People don't shoot at the end of a strafe for perfect accuracy IRL, that's just dumb and very forced. Also flick shots, AKA random chance that subs for skill in this game, dear lord...

Ultimately the downvote comes from the lack of growth in this franchise. They have operations less and less frequently, they never retain the AMAZING operation maps (and why? their map pool is stale and uninteresting IMO, and I know I'm in the minorty here as most CS players despise change and new things, but FFS leave em in the map pool for some of us), and all they do is find new ways to get you to spend money on it.

The question I ultimately asked is, what keeps counter strike alive? Is it the nostalgia? kind of, not really. Is it the overall experience? Partially, as it kept me coming back. But no, the thing that perpetuates this game is SKINS!!!!! CS:GO would have crumbled and died had Valve not introduced their ludicrous skin system ripped from the TF2 hats model. Skins going for hundreds of dollars of REAL MONEY, what the actual fuck. I invested like 8-10 bucks at the beginning of my CS:GO career for skins and never spent a dime more, but it becomes a real obsession for many. And now they have spray paint, gloves, you name it, the game is a damn ATM for Valve, but they don't have the decency to update this decrepid game or even to add maps to it (and all they'd have to add is the operation maps they already had in there already but took away...), and I'm not even going to get into the issues with hackers (spoiler: they just get worse with time). That's why this game only goes on $5 off sales instead of deeper discounts like they used to do, cuz everyone buys it with a fresh account to use hacks, and *hahahahaha* valve realizes they can MAKE MONEY OFF OF HACKERS!

It's not all about the aim, you also need some gamesense to be able to win.

But you might be wondering why the negative review....well it's all because of cheaters.There is just too many of them to the point when the game is just unplayable. I can literarly say that the last 4 or 5 matches have been only cheaters and I'm not only saying this because I'm butthurt.

Most people lose sight of that so they call this game fun. 14 years ago this game would have been top of the line in graphics, gameplay, mechanics, and features. But when compared to todays titles this game is very lack luster and behind the times. Weapons, with the exception of a small few, are equipped with iron sights and yet you can't use them. If you attempted to fire a firearm like the characters in csgo do, you would be ridiculously inaccurate. ""Recoil"" ingame is just you getting progressively less accurate, that is not how recoil works at all. In real life or in other games. Hacking is far to prevelent to make this game enjoyable and smurf accounts are very annoying. The only real time I have fun while playing this game is when I get to together in Teamspeak and fool around with the broken mechanics and useless weapons. Customization is virtually not there if you don't plan on spending a lot of money on skins for your guns. In terms of weapons themselves you are limited to a select few actually useful guns and you can't use the others if you plan on doing well. I'm sorry to break the hype but this game isn't all it is cracked up to be. The matching making system is broken aswell and you often get pitted with players who are for superior in skill to you or, teams that have no idea what they are doing. Valve needs to catch up with the times and stop ripping people off, not only in terms of there bad game but also there ""case unboxing"" where you spend almost $3 per case in hopes that you get lucky and get a skin worth $3 or more. Or if you are really, really lucky you may get a stupidly overpriced virtual knife that sells for steam funds which you cannot withdraw. You can also trade with other people and a lot of them will attempt to scam you with worthless items.

Don't play this game expecting to have fun with it right off the bat. There is fun to be had, no doubt, but you'll have to devote A LOT of time to learning skills, the feel of weapons and maps, etc. If you want to be good at CS:GO, you have to commit to a loser life of playing it from when you wake up until you go to bed. Only then can you enjoy what this game has to offer. I saw this as soon as my first ever round finished. Everyone you play against will be better than you.

Here's the thing. I know how to pull off a decent headshot in FPS games. Hell, I used to play the shit out of CSS years ago, and I was great at it. But when it comes to this game, I'm terrible. It's completley different in almost every way, and not in a good way either. Things were nice and simple in CSS. You pick your weapon, and you shoot the enemy team. In this game, you have to carefully select your loadouts, have all your skins ready, and blah blah blah. You get the point. It's overcomplicated.

I knew that as soon as the main menu booted up, I KNEW I was in deep trouble. Huge walls of text, topped with a load of buttons and pictures scattered around randomly. It's such a god awful mess. It took me 5 minutes to figure out how to join a fucking game. I almost lost my patience and said ""Fuck this shit, I got better things to do like jacking off."" Theres too much shit to click on.

It's funny, because TF2 has come to use the exact same system, but it's main menu is completley different. Everything is simple and understandable, and without a ton of buttons scattered all around the screen.

After playing a good couple of rounds, I've deemed the community 'Rancid'. There are more votekicks and complaining and insults in the chat than there are bullets flying. If you go the wrong way, you'll be insulted. If you die, you're attacked and kicked. If you kill someone from the enemy team, you're not good enough. If you win the round by yourself, you're a hacker. It's a constant barage of horrible bitchy shit. I know that I didn't give it a good enough chance, but from looking at Youtube videos of this game, I'm pretty much spot on.

DO NOT BUY THIS GAME IF YOU WANT TO HAVE FUN!! The only way to have fun is to play this game for MONTHS. Once you have the ability to survive for more than a minute and kill more than 3 people a round, then you can begin to enjoy it. And that's why I hate this game. I have things to do. I have a life. I have more important stuff going on in my life rather than worring about how 'some pro has a purple AWM that I want so I'll spend a couple of weeks trying to get it'.


My advice? Stick to regular CSS and CS1.6. It's a lot less complicated, and a hell of a lot more fun. And as a plus, most people who still play are foreign, so you can't understand them.

It prevents good skilled aimers from carrying a team.

 Skill ceiling is way lower than it was in CS 1.6 and shot hitreg is mostly random, even if you aim perfectly at the head, there is always a luck factor and you can always miss the shot, unless at extremely close ranges. Skill is not so important and instead favors using tons of smokes and nades to deplete time for Terrorists, and T´s cannot do much about it since nades and flashes are so weak in this version.


Also most maps are really bad unbalanced copies of CSS maps, like inferno and train, and people are forced to pay for operation passes to play extra maps in matchmaking.

On the other hand there are many improvements in money and weapon balance specially on ecos, (altough pistols/shotguns are still overpowered and other misc stuff like the GUI, matchmaking and de_nuke balanced, and I would rather play GO with this problems fixed than going back to 1.6 anyday, but at this moment the game is not fun anymore and gameplay is not fully oriented for competitive gameplay.

I only play it because nobody plays the other versions anymore, and most people have to eat it up.
This game had very low player count before the steam market update since the game was really bad, but after it many people started playing it to earn skins, so most of the players dont care about the game, they just idle for drops and watch streams to know on wich teams to bet on csgolounge, they dont actually care about the game, it is a sad truth and its clear that Hidden Path will never update this game to proper conditions.",FALSE

4344,"What a super game. I'm not going to share the typical definitions and reviews of CS:GO as a game, but instead I'm going to write as a player who's had 1000+ hours in the game.

[list]
[*] Whether you should play it really depends on you and your personality under pressure. If you can have fun while losing, tolerate your teammates becoming bitter, or generally being in tense situations, then you CAN play CS:GO. Otherwise, playing the game may be bad for your mental health -- you have been warned.

[*] CS is more of an addictive game,  but not necessarily an enjoyable one. There aren't any memorable experiences -- it's just more of the same, repetitive round pattern. However, even though no two rounds are ever the same, you don't really have fond memories of ""hey that one round, remember that?"", unlike other games. What actually is enjoyable, are the rounds where you defeat the odds and come out on top. But, that's rare. And doesn't make up for all the tough times that the game dishes out to you.

[*] The community could definitely be better. But you have to wade through about 20 people to get 1 good friend, who you can talk to or play with often. Now, don't get me wrong, there are a lot of great people on CS. It's just that, the immature players out-number them >20-to-1. And yeah, nobody actually helps you learn the game while playing.

[*] The game isn't beginner friendly. There's so many things to learn in order to get better at the game. CS offers a barely functional tutorial that will let players get at most upto Silver 4 on the ranking system. In order to get to even Gold Nova 1, or mind you, any rank above that (let's see: Gold Nova 2/3/4, Master Guardian 1/2/Elite/Distinguished, Legendary Eagle 1/Master, SMFC, Global Elite), the guidance from the actual game or the community is quite insufficient.

You have to put in a lot of research from sources like YouTube before you can try really hard to get good at the game. I understand that CS is a competitive skill-based game, but the game should be expected to give the majority of the guidance to the players. The game SHOULD be the primary medium through which you learn the innumerable mechanics.

[*] The graphics has gotten outdated to many games of the current times. The developer has been putting off releasing a new engine for the game too (named ""Source 2"") which supposedly will overhaul the game's... things. And the new UI too, ""Panorama"". In fact, if you play the game, you're not going to be playing it for the graphics or scenary. It's all about the gameplay, your skills/reflexes, and a bit of luck.

[*] What the game is good at nowadays for me, is allowing me to spend a good hour on a very stimulating activity. Or maybe having a match with a couple of friends (5 players on a team). Beware though: all of the usual caveats still apply.
[/list]

In general, I like to compare CS to a game of football or cricket. It's the same concept every round, there are many different leagues of skill, and lots of dull/amazing moments. However, no two rounds are the same, whether you win/lose depends on your skills and your teamwork, and of course, you get better at it the longer you play it. But considering that the enjoyable moments only come from the tense and rare winning moments, I do not feel that the huge investment into the game is worth it.",FALSE

[*] Generic shooter that is been done multiple times.

[*] Community is Ignorant in it's own special way, thus why theres scam Gambling sites and groups that Invite you for ""free 50$ code for CSGO skins."" Don't forget how many people think that Skins make them better at the game.

[*] Toxic Community that no matter what will talk about how they banged your mom last night, Be Racist, sexist, or homophobic. (not a Radical LGBTQ member By The Way) don't forget the people that blast terrible music into your headphones.

4371,"Valve seems hellbent on destroying this game. The numerous updates involve unnecessary changes to maps and often result in decreased fps. This most recent update has largely rendered the game unplayable for me due to the drop in fps (and my PC is not that old). I should not have to upgrade my PC in order to continue to play a game that I purchased 6 years ago. And this is to say nothing of the hackers that Valve is unable to get under control. With every Steam sale, there's a massive influx of hackers who created a new Steam account and picked up the game on the cheap. This creates an awful gaming experience and leads me to actually dread and resent Steam sales.

Update: 
I've spent hours researching how to boost fps, I tried updating drivers, I installed a linux distro with xfce since it's lightweight and uses less system resources, I even tried lowering a bunch of the graphics settings (which I shouldn't have to do on a game that's 6 years old), and after spending almost half a day trying to get the performance back that I had prior to this new (garbage) UI update, it's still largely unplayable due to the drop in fps and weird lag.

Valve thought they could distract everyone from all the negativity surrounding the new (garbage) update by releasing a new (old) gun. Nice try. I'm still waiting for a fix, a (real) way to rollback to a previous version that ran well, or a refund.

Update 3: Newest update seems to still not address the issues and -scaleform no longer seems to work. The new UI is forced and I get a 100 fps loss that comes with it. Hey, but they brought back an old gun, so that makes it all worth it, right?

Update 4: I installed the game in Windows 10, updated graphics card drivers, and it seems to run better under Windows. There's still a noticeable framerate loss, but it's at least playable. The issue seems to be with the Linux version, at least for me, which is insteresting given Valve's new Steam Play push, which is supposed to make Windows games run in Linux. They took a game that ran well in Linux for years (CS:GO) and made it run like shit, and now they're trying to sell people on running Windows games in Linux via Steam Play? Maybe that would be an easier sell if the UI update had been more fully optimized for Linux before rollout.",FALSE

4386,"Ah... I've been long waiting for this moment... CSGO. 
The latest installment of the legendary Counter-Strike franchise.
A great game, full of competition and with the potential to be the most competitive shooter ever created,
let's take a look at the 

PROS
+Full of well balanced firearms. There's a lot of guns, and each fits a specific need. 
Each needs to be learnt very, very well to be a good player.
+Strong competitive-oriented gameplay, rewarding skill and punishing a lot errors. Precise planning can often lead to overwhelming victories, but watch out for the enemy plans aswell, or everything will start going wrong.
+Strong player interaction and communication.
+Good hitdetection, and very good lag compensation.
+Mid-level graphics.
+Very identifiable sounds, surround is a must, and WILL save your life, granted.

But with so many strongpoints, why did i give this game a negative review?
Let's see the 

CONS

-Salt WILL flow. People will rage. Swears will start flying like missiles.
-The game is sinking in bad updates by valve, not caring about the community and literally doing whatever they want,
They keep adding skins, while the game still has a lot of work to be done.
-A ton of cheaters. Too many of these fuckers. VAC isn't helping a lot, creating a very bad experience
-Smurfing is common. Way too common. Very bad for new players.
-Good game, bad technical aspects. A lot of bugs around.
-The game doesn't run that well, and especially after the last updates,even started lagging. This is bad, especially because the graphics didn't change much.
-Valve eventuay releases random stuff that either fucks up the game, creates exploits for nooby silvers to use, absurd stuff that breaks the game etc...
-The game becomes a cheatfest and noobhouse everytime there's a sale. 

------------------------------
Verdict.

CSGO is a good game. If it was an high-end indie game. 
But since the developers are Valve themselves, i was to expect a MUCH better game. The game works? Barely. 
Because of so many small issues here and there that really frustrate me everytime i play. The game usuay leads to rage and salt, and not fun.

There are so many hackers, and the frequent promotional sales just encourage gamers to buy additional low-cost accounts for hax0ring, in order to help their friends rank up or simply to grief honest players. 

It ruins the game for everyone. The cost of hacking is quite simply too low, and it hurts honest players while it puts cash in the developer's wallet. If they really cared about the community, they would put more effort into eliminating haxing, and they would put EVERY dollar earned from promotional low-cost sales of the game into anti-cheat efforts.

Also the frequent amd ridiculous tweaking and un-tweaking of gun and game settings in recent game updates indicate that someone has taken their eye off the ball AND lost touch with the community.

    Valve has completely sold the soul of this game in exchange for a quick buck. Step 1: Go free to play. this invites inordinate amounts of hackers, a toxic community, and forces slower server; players also have to use a horrible ""Trust Factor"" matchmaking system unless they pay for something better. Step 2: Convert the game into Fortnite for the Source Engine. Valve, after going free to play, has not only added and focused the game around a battle royale, but they've recently released player model skins all with battle royale-type price ranges and a watered down ""battle pass"" that plays like swinging a piece of wet cardboard in a moldy sock.
    I expect that pretty soon Valve is going to delete casual and competetive matchmaking and start marketing their own personally-made hacked clients.

Most of the time in this game you spend staring at a wall. Then someone comes out and one of you gets oneshot in the head and has to wait the rest of the round. Alternatively, both of you miss the first shot and whoever sprays better survives. There is little skill past twitch aim with a hitscan weapon and the outcomes are far too significant for how consistent can one realistically get.

Sometimes you'll get killed through the smoke, sometimes you'll get instaflashed and die. Sometimes you'll get outplayed fair and square, but only sometimes.

The competetive mode is impossible to climb out of, with smurfs at every corner at low levels, and hackers infesting the higher levels. 

The inability to vote kick players on both teams, like in all valve games, is a dysfunction that actively hampers the overall enjoyment.

And by the way, two griefing bans make a VAC ban, a.k.a a perma ban. The game itself is a good game, with good mechanics and slightly underwhelming graphics.

Can't say I'm a fan of bullets not going toward your crosshair either, because of the recoil ""bullet patterns"". It's a problem since they're not random, so you're forced to learn them if you want to compete, because everyone else knows them. 
So in those situations where you want to hold down the fire button for longer than 1 second during close range combat and go for a headshot, you have to aim at their feet, then a little to the left, then the right. It's incredibly frustrating. 
Most of the time, you'll get beat by someone who took the time to download the recoil bullet pattern training map and mastered it.

4549,"This game is frustrating and not fun, and the quoted ""high skill required to play"" is extremely misunderstood. The game only emphasizes a handful of skills, and in extremely specific ways, with no room for expansion or depth.

For example, spray patterns, which are designed to prevent moving while firing, are preset instead of random. The main reason for this is that preset spray patterns require more skill than random ones. By making these ""skill based"" (and I use that term lightly - it's more like rote learning than actual skill, and literally everyone can do it with the right muscle memory), they have effectively allowed players to fire in full-auto with significantly more accuracy than the weapons are designed to have, because they solved a memory puzzle (congrats). These kinds of awkward design decisions for the sake of ""skill"" exist throughout the game, and serve to seriously negatively effect the experience for everyone. For skilled players, they are annoying extra steps that everyone has to take to compete, with no way to strategise with them to outplay their opponent, making them ultimately pointless compared to the random ones. In low-skill cases they turn fights that someone with bad positioning and bad aim doesn't deseve to win, but they do because they played the memory game.

I guess my point is that a large portion of the skills in this game seem to be effectively there for the sake of ""making the game high skill"", without actual thought put into how they improve the depth of the game, or how they improve the strategy, instead being simple mechanical actions players have to learn and memorise that provide them no real advantage once all players start to use the same memorization techniques. Another element of this is the mechanic where weapon accuracy resets INSTANTLY upon stopping movement. Instead of encouraging good positioning or implementing risk-reward movement strategies during firefights, the game relies on forcing players to memorize the ""move, release movement key, fire, press movement key"" style of play. There is no way to use this particular skill to outplay your opponent, as everyone is using it and there's no depth or interaction with it, it's simple clockwork. What is the point of having these sorts of mechanics if they cancel themselves out once every player in a game starts to use them, which happens as early as the Gold Nova ranks? Skill-based gameplay is supposed to open options and allow players to intelligently outplay each other or take advantage of certain situations and take risks for potential benefits, rather than just being a practiced technique everyone memorizes and then awkwardly uses because it's the technical best thing to do in every situation, with no real way to use those skills intelligently.

Many of the mechanics also work against themselves. Weapon prices are supposed to be a natural counterbalance to the usefulness of a particular weapon, for balance reasons. However this is a game where the cheaper weapons are borderline useless, so the normal strategy is to save for a round and then for the next round buy the absolute best (an AK/M4 or the AWP). This encourages an extremely one-dimensional approach to purchasing weapons, as rather than encouraging a wide variety of weapons to be used, and influencing balance through pricing, instead we just see teams throwing away a round or two to get the ""good"" guns. This completely circumvents the entire point of having differently priced guns, and makes the vast majority of the weapons in the game completely unnecessary. At the same time, undue emphasis is placed on money, to the point where a good or bad economy can make or break a game for a team. These two mechanics exist in conflict with each other, and in both cases is detrimental to gameplay. A system that seems to have been designed to balance weapon usage has instead resulted in only a small handful of weapons ever being used, and teams having to effectively throw rounds because they lost the previous, making every defeat twice as damaging and effectively punishing people even more than usual for having a bad round. The other big problem with the economy is the pistol rounds. The economy is so important to CS that winning or losing a pistol round can often decide victory for the next 2-3 rounds. While efforts have been made in a recent patch to address this, the issue remains. This ""the rich get richer and the poor get poorer"" approach to the economy effectively means that even small victories - such as winning the pistol round by only a tiny margin (such as 1 remaining teammate on 15 health) can still have a HUGE effect on the game, often times more significant than larger victories can have later in the game, which is extremely unbalanced.

The game is also extremely slow a lot of the time, relying on camping certain positions and holding sites in very specific, predictable ways every round, especially as the CTs. There is no depth to this system other than whereabouts within the site you decide to camp, and there's no incentive to use creative strategies such as rushes or stacking, especially as the CTs, as the time to rotate is far too long and retaking a site often means a loss. So we see the same ""3 people go A, 2 go B"" or ""2 go A, 1 mid, 2 B"" strategy game in and game out, and it's extremely boring and monotonous. Movement based strategies such as ambushes are heavily penalized as well, mainly because of the AWP which effectively punishes peaking and any sort of movement.

There are other issues as well. The AWP is extremely frustrating to fight against because of the way it's designed, as it's inherent anti-peeker design means that in almost all cases it results in a ""turn a corner, die instantly"" style of play. This is especially prevalent in competitive matchmaking, where often an entire team can be wielding AWPs, resulting in a very slow game where everyone is so afraid of peeking a corner that they just stand around and don't progress at all. When they do, it's effectively random who dies or not based on if they got lucky and went around the corner the AWP user wasn't watching. This can be somewhat mitigated with smoke grenades and flashbangs, but throwing them slows the gameplay down even further. The maps also seem to be designed around very specific AWP spots and very specific grenade spots, which effectively serve to counter each other, resulting in the same round playing out, often a couple of times per match, as the AWPer camps the same spot, and we nade the same spot.

My overall point is, while some skilled play is definitely possible, even with the AWP, this is not representative of the general experience, and there is so much other cruft to put up with even in good rounds - the economy when everyone is buying the same guns that only serves to punish the losers - the long wait at each site in the same positions waiting for the enemies to come - the borderline useless spray-pattern system, that the bad MASSIVELY outweighs the good. There are plenty of other high skill games, and a few other high-skill shooters. Almost all of them encourage a wider variety of skills than this game, and almost all of them require less simple rote learning and muscle memory, instead encouraging strategy and adapting to the playstyle of your opponents, something barely present in CS:GO. This game's popularity seems to come from it's inherent gameplay style, something not replicated elsewhere (and for good reason), and it's perceived prestige as a high-skill shooter for intelligent people, rather than it's overall game design.

If you are someone who values varied, interesting and deep gameplay experiences, avoid this game at all costs. If you're looking for something that requires immense amounts of skill, and will reward unusual and intelligent tactics, will force you to legitimately out-think your opponent, and where victory is based on strategy rather than muscle memory, go play Dota 2.",FALSE

MM:
most of the player base is in low silver-nova. your mg-dmg players are alright but you're finally introduced to the bane of the game; HACKERS. High elo MM is basically just a bunch of subhuman's wanting to achieve something in life and decide to buy a hack to help them git gud in video games. See a global elite? 90% of the time hacking. See a new profile? probably hacking. There's just no point grinding it out on matchmaking because cheaters make the game unplayable. Their anti cheating system is slow and unreliable. Reports go nowhere, it takes hackers ATLEAST 1-2 years to actually get banned.

For better experience, play FACE IT, or ESEA.

Valve is just milking this cash cow, and cares very little about this game. It's going to reach almost a decade and they still have not found a viable solution to this problem. It takes a game like VALORANT, being a potential threat at swindling CSGO's audience for them to finally ATTEMPT fixing the issue that has been going around since its genesis.

See this article: https://www.sportskeeda.com/esports/valorant-vs-cs-go-will-valve-s-new-anti-cheat-solution-potent-hacker-fix-riot-s-vanguard-probably-not

It's funny i think i havent won a competitive game since april. Every time i play i play against people who are way better than me. After all these losses i havent deranked yet. Probably because i report everyone on the other team every single match and get my elo back. The other team is not always the problem though. Usually my team gets mad at me for not running straight into a site and dying like them. This game is not what it used to be and i wish i hadnt spent so much money on it. So many cases and never a knife. Thanks valve. I should also say thanks to valve for keeping the cheaters away from the game. Every time you add a new case i can imagine that scares a lot of cheaters away. When you add new sounds or gloves i am willing to bet that nobody gives a shit and wonders when the next ban wave will come in. But nah. Month after month of new skins and random garbage that doesnt matter. Oh yeah, i buy a ""geniune"" nuke pin for a good amount of money and then they go release them for everybody? This used to be my favorite game. Now i would recommend playing a game like Overwatch. You see valve, when somebody cheats in Overwatch, they are banned for life. They cant even play Overwatch ever again on that pc. Overwatch is like tf2 and its a great game. I cant wait until blizzard makes a perfected version of counter strike because i cant play the valve version anymore. gg add me on battle net @ SteelEagle14#1471

[*]- A lot of Korean players
[*]- In-game purchases for real money
[*]- Lack of plot
[*]- Weak character animations
[*]- Lack of easter eggs/secrets inside the game
[*]- The dominance of cheaters, on which no one cares. After all, they buy ""cases"" and contribute to the treasury of developers
[*]- Pretty toxic player community
[*]- Only text localization into third-party languages
[*]- Team game where players don't care about team play
[*]- flat sound
[*]- Some of the enemies have a dark palette of costumes, giving them an advantage in dark places on the map
[*]- Defective behavior of the revolver. It seems that the developers have not seen it live
[*]- Map setting is carried out blindly. You don't see any changes until you exit the menu
[*]- Inconvenient menu for purchasing items and weapons
[*]- Paid player statistics
[*]- Warning text before the start of a ranked game - does not fit on the sign
[*]- Demining is almost instantaneous
[*]- The player is able to pick up weapons by looking at them from a distance of several meters
[*]- Matchmaking in a ranked game is terrible. So players with titles can be put against you, while your team will be without them.
[*]- Flawed physics and behavior of grenades
[*]- Ability to enable macros for gaming keyboards and mice. Up to auto-aiming and conducting the enemy.
[*]- You can be kicked out of the team - just like that. If your team wants it
[*]- Running with a knife is not much different from running with a gun. But it is considered faster.
[*]- If the speed of running with different weapons changes, then the height of the jump remains static.[/list]

[b]Conclusion:[/b]
A cult game that has become a cult not because of the idea - but because of the simple implementation. The player does not need to calculate the trajectory of the bullet, think about where the grenade will bounce - after all, the game has simple physics! Where he aimed - there he hit!
Add to this the Source engine, which is not demanding on hardware. The ability to create your own servers - which bred like cats in March in local networks throughout Russia. And you will receive a product - which will be remembered and loved.
And what if the player gets a ""case"" that can be sold on the trading floor - despite the fact that he will get it just by playing the game? Yes, it's a goldmine!

CS:GO will die slowly due to hackers (aka Cheaters) everywhere.
Besides, it doesnt have Zombie Scenarios like in Counter Strike Online..

Indonesian Counter Strike Online (aka CSO) which i played
for 5 years is even better than PointBlank because the latter couldnt handle
Cheaters like we saw in CSGO nowadays..

Indonesian PointBlank died under GemsCool Management, then acquired by Megaxus, and died..
Currently under its own Developer's (Zeppeto) Management..

CSO of course have cheaters also but it is Wallhack only and you can use it for 2-3 days, then the game will be patched..
so you need to wait for a newer version of Wallhack, which usually took 2-3 days too..

What i mean is, there will be 2-3 days per week where everyone is playing clean and pure..
and everyone is walling too during another 2-3 days..so it is fair enough..

CSGO, is now quite boring..the Plant & Defuse, Hostage, Deatmatch, Arms Race, became boring through time.
The Developer should add more Game Modes, like Zombie Scenarios where everyone become friends..
no Trollings, no Racists, no Hackers, and Players will help each other to defeat Zombies and the Boss..

Such Game Mode creates a more condussive and friendly community..
also more items and weapons which can be used against Zombies only..

Pro's and Con's of CS GO:

+skill based combat (in competitive mode). no killstreak rewards, no magic. nicely balanced guns.
+big community
+many fancy design options
+graphics every now and then are improved

-hackers are everywhere
-cheating must go undetected by VAC 99% of the time (subjectively)
-you cannot exit a server without getting a penalty which means you sit through 90 minutes gameplay with hackers all the time
-no matter what open server you go on, it's full of russians
-grieving and flaming. LOTS of it
-game is frustrating as f***
-wastes a lot of your time stuck on servers u don't want to play on

[b] [u] Brief Overview [/u] [/b]

Counter-Strike: Global Offensive was released onto the [i] Steam Market [/i] on August 21, 2012. The game is a first person shooter, and is hard to handle to newcomers. What sets this game apart from other FPS games like the [i] Call of Duty Franchise [/i] and the [i] Battlefield Franchise [/i] is the gameplay. Like I stated previously, this game is hard to pickup. Newcomers have a select pick of gamemodes that they can play, to level themselves up. Once they've reached a certain criteria and level, the game decides they are ready to head into competitive matchmaking, the heart of the game.  Another core part is the community servers. Custom game modes, allow for a more fun and relaxed experience. 

[b] [u] Competitive [/u] [/b]

Competitive follows a plan of two teams. Terrorists and Counter-Terrorists. The terrorists must plant the bomb on A or B site and have it explode to win the round. The Counter-Terrorists or CT must either defuse the bomb when planted or eliminate all the Terrorists to win the round. The gamemode takes up to 30 minutes, and if one team reaches 16 points they win the game. If both teams reach 15 points, the game ends in a draw. 

[b] [u] Ranking System [/u] [/b]

To which after a player plays 10 [u] competitive matches [/u] they will be ranked based upon skill level. He or she will be awarded one of the following ranks:

Silver 1
Silver 2
Silver 3

I'd rather not list all the ranks, but you get the idea. This system ranks the player by their own skill level, allowing for more fair play. Silvers will play with other silvers in their skill system, so on and so fourth.

[b] [u] Keys, Crates and Skins [/u] [/b]

The game has it's very own unique ""lottery"" system for players to unlock and equip skins for their hellish weaponry. Players must pay $2.49 for a key, and around 1-2 cents for a crate. From there, they unlock the crate, and a lottery style slot machine rolls through, casing many skins. The skins are ranked on style, wear, and worth. Skins that have blue around them, are cheap and probably aren't that good looking. Purples are relatively better but around the same. Pink are pretty good, and you can actually make some money off them. Red are very very good, and you can definetly make some profit off them. Gold are the best of the best. Otherwise known as knives, these knives can sell on the steam market, for up to $900+ alone. Gold are very hard to get, and it takes some luck. 


[b] [u] Thoughts on the game [/u] [/b]

CSGO is a fun team-based game and has a lot of things that make it unique and different from other FPS games. I have spent a lot of time playing the game, and think I'm about an average player. Not to bad, but not a pro either. Had my fair share of opening crates and to my surprise, unboxed a knife! That moment was short lived when I bet it on a CSGO gambling site and it got scammed from my grasp, ouch. But, the game has many downfalls. Aside from the annoyance of 11 year olds screaming in the mic to rush B or russians yelling ""SUKA"", the game just isn't what it used to be. You now get deranked for doing bad in a game. The servers have become infested with cheaters, and the clique of smurf accounts, is raging and vile. The game developers have become money hungry, and focus more on making profit then the actual millions of gamers reaching out to them. All in all, the game I believe hasn't reached it's full potential and I think we'll be seeing more from the game in the near future. I hope things get fixed, as I would love to go back and play it some more.",FALSE
4674,"Boy oh boy is this ****** cancer!

Very unfriendly to new players. Low ranks are a bottomless pit with no escape unless you get a whole new account due to smurfs, trolls, hackers and people who are idiots. Loss after loss forever, versus 5 cued smurfs on the other team or hackers.

So you would think, after spending CASH on this game, that I would be able to play with my friends, right? I bought the game for that.
Nope! You have to play 5 hours of casual. During which, people micspam racist music and other things, act toxic, insult, etc. This game is/was the worst community on the internet, bar none. Even 4/4+4chan, Encyclopaedia Dramatica, Kiwi Farms are better than this pile. Maybe League is worse but I've never played it. And League probably doesn't let players play music to everyone that's loud enough to blow out your speakers.

After that- Things will get better, right? 
Nope! Low rank matches have hackers upon hackers, smurfs upon smurfs, and you get loss after loss as you're trying to learn the game. Why would Valve increase the price of their game or IP ban hackers? The hackers buy the game for $15 again and again, to troll 2 to 4 matches, then get banned, and repeat. And repeat. So why would they stop if it makes them money?
I would much prefer to spend $60 on a game I know works than $15 on a game that is nothing but aids and racial slurs.

Once you win 10 comp. matches, things get better, right?
Nopity Nope! You get banned for a full 24 hours FOR WINNING. You have to sit there AND WAIT and can't play comp again!

Add a new paypal account? Great- you can't trade items for 6 days!
Just got the game? Great! You can't sell or buy items for a full month!

Everything about this game treats new players like they're cheaters/hackers/smurfs/trolls, while allowing experienced players to do those things with little effort. Very steep learning curve that is not helped in most ways, very toxic community, very fustrating game mechanics, server performance getting worse every day- rubber banding at 65 ping, if you have more than 250ms ping you teleport all over the map and can do nothing at all, and on top of it all- you get banned just for WINNING.

It was a big mistake reinstalling this and expecting it to be any more horrendously bad than it was 3 years ago. I mean what in the actual hell?

-A sniper rifle that kills on contact with bullet. Just contact...Shoot a new hole for a piercing in their ear, they die.
-Spray & Pray religion hotbed. Don't even bother with aiming, just shoot in their general direction and hope you land a headshot.
-Frag Grenades are more like firecrackers. Worthless to buy
-Flashbang grenades stun and blind you outside in broad daylight from 20 feet away. I laughed at the unrealism on this one.

He started digging for gold.
He dug in so deep he ruptured a subterrainean blood deposit, causing His cave to almost flood, but luckily it dried to a crust quickly in the dry vacuum of space.
He kept digging, and struck a foul, gut wrenching odor, like something had died in there and was slowly decaying within it's own funk in that enclosed pod made out of condensed fiery shit of unknown origin.
He put on a hazmat suit and dug his hand into what sounded like a mixture of rotten fruit and buckets of microwaved smegma, until He pulled out a square, flat shaped object, covered in mucus, shit, and ashes from pre-burned shit.

4709,"Over 600 hours on CS:GO. Over 13 years playing CS in general. In older versions of CS if you are high skilled you can easily take down 5 low skilled players. In this version you are lucky to get onto the 3rd guy.

Game is all about luck, not skill based like all previous versions of the game. Ranked up to DMG with over 200 wins in competetive and i can say this game should be released as a 5 person COOP. You should only play comp when you have 4 other friends who you know won't troll you, regardless of their skill level its better to have that than random teammates.

The hit reg in this game is absolutely nothing compared to previous versions, due to the low bandwidth allocated to the gaming servers setup by valve.

The skin system is nothing but a huge money grabbing scheme which no doubt has earnt a huge amount more than the game sales alone. 

As with all games you can trade in, this one is full of scammers. Constantly, daily trying to scam your high value items from you. Procede with extreme caution when making trades with anyone you don't know. 

This game promotes gambling to under 18s with the skin drop system, costing each skin a certain price with a possible return on investment. Gambling sites are regulated and usually offer around 85% return on your gambling in the long run. I believe there is no regulation of this system and there's plenty of 12yr old kids out there throwing away hundreds into this system.

Alot of reviews have complained about cheaters. This isn't such a bad problem nowa days as the overwatch system has taken over VAC in the competetive section of the game, blatent cheaters are caught and banned for 1 year quite quickly and the players that support and judge in this system are to thank.

Overall the game it's self has a great system but just isn't being used to its full potential. Allocate more time and money please valve.

4772,"So first of all~

I'm not recommending this game based on what I personally think... csgo isn't a super bad game or isn't even exactly bad at all. But it's a game I don't recommend to the average casual player unless if you are willing to play a game that is purely for skill and prestige and climbing elo and less about enjoying the gameplay imo.

Also I haven't really played actual games like ranked mode and my review focuses more on just general gameplay versus knowing much more about strategies and depth involved. Basically if you don't plan on playing ranked mode... don't buy this game at all haha.
----------
Pros~

- Is based on tactical gameplay and less on run and gun like black squad and other generic fps games. So~ this means it's about positioning... using your aim at the right time... knowing how to look at corners and predict where people are... crosshair placements etc. Aim matters a lot too but it isn't a brainless game compared to a lot of general fps games.

- Guns are consistent with recoil patterns. You can learn to predict and control every gun if you have the muscle memory~

- AWP is extremely satisfying to use in this game. It isn't instant quick scope free kills like in black squad and feels way more fair. But~ it's still super good for consistent one shots and manually having to quick switch since snipers automatically scope back in etc~ It's accurate still... the awp just has a nice touch to it which I appreciate.

- Skill ceiling and game sense are incredibly high in this game. What makes csgo popular imo isn't exactly the gameplay itself... I mean I guess to some it is but imo why it's so popular is because it is such a rich competitive playerbase. Like... lots of csgo comes down to winning and putting your skills up for a challenge and trying to improve. If you want a game to literally main and put 1000 hours in... honestly csgo will reward that haha. It's kind of like tf2 with being able to master it so deeply.

- Pretty accurate hitboxes with fair bullet sizes....? Basically if you missed you missed and if you hit it's because you actually hit someone. This actually impressed me with how accurate the hitboxes are like... if you hit 1 cm off the neck of a person it actually misses versus counting that as a headshot or whatever. Imo accurate hitboxes are always preferable~

Cons~

- I feel like it isn't optimized....? It's an older game and yet I get way~ more fps in other similar games. Like in l4d2 I can maintain 60+ fps with like 50+ zombies and throw in gunfire and grenades and yet in this game the moment I look at the map I'm dropping to 40 fps or so I feel....? Maybe my computer is worse than I thought hahaha~ but to me it was like actually unplayable and I couldn't aim at all because of that. But I expected csgo to be very easy to run like tf2 or paladins so maybe I just had the wrong expectations?

- Map and character models blend in too much. Maybe it was because I turned everything to low quality but it was really~ hard for me to distinguish player models. Like in black squad you can easily see how models stood out from the map textures but here it all really blends in. Not sure if that's just me or if it's intended but I feel like the map quality should be far reduced or color schemes on either char model or map textures should be looked at. 

- Imo everything but the awp feels clunky...? Switching weapons around felt really slow and you couldn't quite tell when an animation was complete. So like I took out my pistol when out of ammo and the gun doesn't even shoot until way~ later. I guess it's to really help with the tactical layer though... so you can't just spray down your rifle and then go to your pistol and begin killing everyone else as you would in other fps games.

- Guns were very sensitive to tapfire rates... so tap a little and suddenly the gun will burst when you intended only single fire. Maybe in this game single fire shots are counted as way longer than I expected but this made gun control hard which... yes that's good for increasing skill cap but for me it became frustrating to not ever be able to cleanly feel the guns.

- Movement and shooting are separate/cannot be done at the same time if you want decent accuracy. Again prevents run and gun but the general average player will not be used to this. I come from tf2/class based shooters where your skill is bsaed on not whether you can shoot or move well independently but based on if you can do both perfectly at the same time. csgo splits it up... which again is good to stop run and gun which kills off game skill caps but it's not intuitive and even minor left and rights need perfect timings to shoot.
-----------
Verdict~

Csgo is a great game if you're willing to put in the time to get good at it. But is the gameplay fun and casual...? Imo not really. It's a game you play if you actually want to win and climb elo. Otherwise you're going to sacrifice ease of gaming and just general fast paced shooters with lots more interesting things going on. But~ if you really enjoy that tactical gameplay style versus raw fighting like in tf2 and paladins and prefer tactical game sense versus game knowledge game sense like again in tf2 or paladins then csgo would fit you well.

It's basically just a super serious game and a game where you work on perfecting your aim and tactical game sense.

So I recommend it if that's what you're looking for but for the average player... honestly csgo is a bit too high of a learning curve imo to have just casual fun. And for me I like to play seriously and improve but I'm definitely way more casual and don't play ranked modes etc. So for me csgo is basically just too clunky... hard to run.... and the gun control and movement are very limiting especially as someone who plays fps games with higher mobility. There are other games to play if you're like me where after a long day of work you just want to hop on and shoot people. Can't quite do that in csgo... but what you can do is actually improve so much and compete against other prestigious and competitive players who are aiming to be the top~

4777,"This game continues to garner praise years after its release that I find relatively undeserved. Different strokes for different folks, I just didn't find the appeal and I'll list off a few reasons why. Totally get why some would love it, but here is my take...

Retro feeling, not in a good way. The graphics are old, clunky, and reminiscent of the poorly designed wave of late 2000's Free-to-play FPS's like Soldier Front, Wolfteam, Ironsight etc. This might signal nostalgia for some, but as a new player I felt like I was playing a supposedly top market game with the detail of an asset-sell cash grab.

Very clunky, missing simple and essential controls, glitchy. Screw all sense of modern gameplay and realism. Bunny hopping, no running, bugging on people's heads for weird meta kill spots, no leaning, no ADS'ing.

Maps are the same rebranded nonsense of that weird 2000's FPS from when you were 10-15. Two spawns, three lanes, one middle room. Imagine all of the tactics and strategies that go into that.

Hackers galore. Aimbots, walls, and more. Everybody is doing it. The kiddies, the streamers, the pros.

Trash UI and communication system. Everything is MESSY. There's shit flashing all over your screen, the killfeed and mission info is intrusive, everybody has a mic (which is not a good thing if you're not playing comp, trust me). It felt like I was on some kind of awful Gary's Mod server with over-complex chat controls, loud flashing visuals, and mouthbreathing.

Weird gun controls that don't handle like any other game. I know this is often listed as a pro, the argument of predetermined recoil versus randomized, realism versus COD spray, snipers versus SMG functionality... Didn't like it. As an FPS veteran I don't think playing CS:GO should be some sort of requirment for aim-training and weapon mechanics like many seem to feel. The guns felt awful and like no other game I've ever played, from Wolfteam to Black Ops to Quake to Rainbow Six.

Ultimately at a $15 price tag... avoid! I could recommend this as another generic F2P FPS, or maybe a balanced shooter to pick up on sale... but the barebones, retro aspect keeps me from recommending this title fully.",FALSE

4782,"================== PROS ==================

- The game has it's own economy of weapon skins. It has gambling features such as weapon case opening (just google it). This can be cool depending on whether or not you care about game cosmetics or owning expensive rare items.

- Complex competitive matchmaking ranking system which does quite a good job at representing players' true skill. I don't think any other FPS game has a ranking system as complex as CS:GO but don't quote me on that.

- Easy to play with friends. You can set up a lobby and invite your friends and get a game going in less than minutes.

================== CONS ==================

- The game has lately been heavily catered towards casual players by introducing an EXP-based ranking system which just represents how much time you've spent playing and/or how much money you've spent purchasing in-game missions which reward you with EXP.

- Valve prioritize cosmetic additions over fixing game breaking bugs. There are bugs still in this game that have existed since the game's release such as major hit-registration and hitbox related bugs.

- Game performance is on par, however this should be expected since the graphics are intentionally very static (no destructible environments or fancy explosion effects). Performance could be improved with a newer, less bloated game engine.

- Not very many competitively viable maps to play on. It would be better to see high quality map pools that rotate each season in matchmaking.

- Terrible matchmaking server performance. Valve's dedicated servers used for matchmaking are truly dreadful. The fact that we have to use 3rd party services such as ESEA or Faceit to play on fast and responsive servers is shocking.

================ CONCLUSION ===============

Overall, this game doesn't really satisfy what I originally liked Counter Strike for. It used to be known as the single best military-style competitive team-based FPS experience but it seems like Valve isn't prioritising their efforts on crucial competitive aspects such as weapon balancing, gameplay mechanics, or bug fixes. For the past 2 years, the majority of the updates have been used to attract more players rather than making the game more competitively viable which is why I no longer support or play this game.",FALSE

I'll explain it in the sense of each sort of taste, then delve into my everlasting love-hate opinions with the game. So the taste. CS:GO is not for people that want to casually play for a few hours a week; it really isn't. If you have multiple hours a day to dedicate, go for it. It takes a lot of practice to be good at the game. You must improve aim, learn recoil patterns on weapons, smokes, flashes, tactics. It's a lot of dedication if you want to be decent. If it's someting you want to play for a couple hours on a saturday night with friends, then it's really not fun dying 24/7. I'd recommend Battlefield or COD over it any day for casual gaming. There is a ton of depth into the game, and you really can't be stupid to play it. There are skins worth ridiculous amounts of money that people actually purchase with their hard earned money. All in all CS:GO is a dedicated tactical shooter worth checking out if you're looking for something to really get into and grind.

[b]My Opinion[/b]

My experience with the community has been terrible. They are single handedly some of the most ""toxic"" people I have ever met. Most of the people that play this game were never taught the golden rule, and can't go a minute wthout harsh critisism, vulgar language, and trash talk. Essentially most everyone will try to put you down. I personally hate the shooting mechanics of CS:GO, they are extremely frustrating at times to deal with, and you HAVE to dedicate time to learning recoil patterns, you really do. Even with nearly 400 hours I have forgotten recoil patterns at times within a week of not playing. YOU MUST DEDICATE, and for me it just doesn't work. It overall isn't that bad of a game, but it's an acquired taste as I said above. I am on the fence for a rating; but what pushed me over to negative review so easily is the terrible community that the game has notoriously built. A ton of rude people (with the exception of a few good ones, I sound like Donald Trump lol) , that are always trying to bring you down, and with the fact of immense dedication you must put in to be good and have some fun. In my eyes, I would not recommend CS:GO to any friends, period. Now I think I'll move on to Rainbow 6: Siege.",FALSE

A fight consists of both players crouching and holding down left click and hoping they kill the other player. aparently there is ""recoil"" in this game but the only thing close to recoil is your bullets shooting out of your gun and going up insted of your gun being pushed up by the force of the bullets coming out, this makes the game kind of anoying. the only reason I think this game is so popular is because of its fun competative games which I do enjoy even if there are only two game modes. also this game give you the option to spend about 200 dollars on a reskin of your knife which you are never going to get a kill with.

I thought you'd learn from your mistakes as you said in your mediocre apology regarding said disaster. I guess I'm about as dumb as my profile name suggests. You guys are still inconceivably disconnected with your community and unreasonably greedy. Jumping on the BR bandwagon in some pathetic attempt to wring out the already dry cloth.

Cheaters have been running rampant since I started playing this title. Also, how is it that a handful of third party matchmaking services have 128 tick and you guys don't? The community has been requesting the same things for so long. You see this. Ignore it. Spread your cheeks and squeeze out this wonderful update for us to enjoy. Then as a fat middle finger to your community you make the game F2P. Then give us a special little badge and a little loot crate full of useless trinkets that have no effect on the actual gameplay (which you still have to pay money to open).

Yes, someone (Not me) called a vote to kick him and I agreed because he's throwing the match, but appearantly in 2 weeks of no matchmaking play, one vote to kick got me ANOTHER 7 day ban. This is a continued portrayal to CS:GO's broken economy and has dropped my rating to 0/10, how can a game be rated greatly when it prevents all access to competetive players even when there's a fallacy involved?

3/13/15 Edit: Another ban to add to this list; this time it's from being kicked too many times, giving me another 7 day, and here's how it happened. The game was a Comp. Office; the CT was whooping our asses so far, yet with me being second top on our team, three of the players who were in a team decided to kick me, because they cannot win. This further proves my thesis that CS:GO is still broken majorly when it comes to matchmaking bans; the utter fact that this game has the audasity (Phonics FTW) to allow things like this to keep happening with no way of appealing to anyone about getting it lifted.",FALSE

My first 100 hours were pretty fun, its a cool game to play with your friends

[h1] 2017 REVIEW [/h1]
[h1] FULL IN-DEPTH REVIEW [/h1]
[b] Wow, 2.4k+ hours have passed quite quickly, and its about time I write a review for this addicting yet pathetic game [/b]
[i] If you want to play CS:GO, you should've came in 2014 when it was at its highest peak. Gradually, the game and community has deteriorated. Neglecting the community constantly, Valve has found several ways to fuck its community over. [/i]
[h1] Examples: [/h1]
[b] iBUYPOWER Throw [/b] 
[i] -in Janurary of 2015, Valve officially declared that iBP was banned from all Valve majors as a punishment for matchfixing (betting against own team and throwing), however a DotA 2 team also accused of matchfixing only faced a 12 month punishment [/i]
[b] Gambling [/b]
[i] -Valve has gotten major publicity from people gambling, and did nothing to stop it until it was too late, resulting in a major loss of players and a reduction in CS:GO's already terrible reputation. [/i]
[b] R8 Revolver [/b] 
[i] -a pointless and overpowered gun, the R8 revolver was introduced to CS:GO, a gun Valve nerfed ONLY after the skin prices dropped. Now, the gun is forgotten and uncared about, way to go Valve. [/i]
[b] Ladder Glitch [/b]
[i] -Valve has repetitively ignored the messed up ladder movement on Nuke and Train, a glitch which can be easily fixed. Instead, Valve has more and more skins to the game, Chroma 2, Chroma 3, Falchion, you name it. [/i]
[b] Graffiti [/b]
[i] -most Valve games have sprays that can be edited or even uploaded, so when told we were going to be able to use sprays, the community got excited. However, they gave us sprays costing several dollars that could only be used a maximum of 50 times. [/i]
[b] Gloves [/b]
[i] -not much to say about it, besides the fact that Valve has added another useless item that does not benefit to the game, but does benefit to their profits.
[b] Hitboxes [/b]
[i] -hitboxes have been broken in CS:GO for the longest time until they recently decided to fix it. It was a huge factor in ruining professional games as well as casual gameplay, by not registering damage to the target even though the crosshair was perfectly on the target. [/i]
[h1] Community [/h1]
[b] He has better aim than me, he's using aimbot.
He has better game sense than me, he's using walls. [/b]
[i] Don't get me wrong, there are many people in this community that are extremely nice and good people to be around, but CS:GO has one of the most toxic communities around.
-blaming you for their deaths
-telling you not to buy a gun because you're bad with it
-ordering what they want you to do in a 1v[x] situation
-kicking someone for one bad play
-constantly spaming chat
-nonstop accusing people of hacking
-telling you to buy them a gun nearly every round
-making fun of you for your rws
-saying that they're better than you just because of your score this game
-blaming hitboxes or 64 tick servers
-saying ""this is why I play ESEA/FACEIT/CEVO
-spinbotting because he thinks enemy team is hacking
-nonstop talking in mic about their day
-constantly insulting you
-throwing game because one thing didn't go right
-kicking people because they are squeakers
-saying they're better than you because they have more hours

[b]+ Game info +[/b]
since this game is free now theres really no reason not to get it lol, but if you like the old CSS and stuff then this probably isnt for you, there are community servers but a fraction of the players actually use them, although if you like the more standard COD style of multiplayer then this CS is for you, but i wish they also kept the ""Missions"" system like in Conition Zero Deleted Scenes

then devs could make new maps with bot enemies and an objective where the map is more linear like the missions in Condition Zero, so ppl can play through together or solo which would add a whole different play style, let alone would make Operations worth it. (and where the F did the Sprays go? damnit guys that was the most awesome custom feature ever and added that perfect personal touch for each player, let alone it gave ppl something to do when they saw an open empty wall)

[b]+ Free to play change +[/b]
Skip to the bottom under the ------- line for the important stuff if you would like to avoid what some might call a rant lol.

yeah the free to play now is bull, the point is everyone that used their hard earned money to buy the game not expecting it would be free eventually and may have been shafted, if its going to be free eventually they should say so on the games release so the ppl that are willing to pay the devs straight up can do so, or the ones that dont can wait for the public release, otherwise its a bait and switch to advertise a game as costing so much and get as many of the players to buy it as they can, then switch it to free to play so they get money from the market transactions of the players that normally wounldnt buy the game.

im very dissappointed valve, i didnt expect this from you guys, i mean maybe starting to fall into the generic game design company theme yeah, but not the shady practices of screwing the community willing to pay for your game by making it free to try and make as much as possible from everyones in-game transactions that werent willing to buy it. (micro pays / buying and selling skins)

to be fair maybe it was a completely genuine act of generosity, maybe they planned to keep the game a paid game forever but realized after a few years of market transactions they can now open it up and make it free to play for everyone else since they dont need to get paid for each copy, and if that is the case im sorry CSGO devs, but thats not really how it was recieved and its kinda hard to believe since so many other games / devs are doing the same thing, release the game and sell it as usual with no indication its going to be free eventually, then a few years after sales drop they go free to play to make as much as they can from in-game transactions, which they can do if they want but its just shady to not inform yourcommunity at release when thats what the plan is.

at this point the game has gotten so into the generic, matchmaking, run and gun ""Call of Duty"" style of multiplayer its not even worth calling it ""Counter-Strike"" and the Community Dedicated servers are suffering, which is destroying the whole Counter-Strike community that was built before CSGO in CS and CSCZ finally to CSS, personally i feel like they should have just named it a new game name so we would have 2 good game titles to follow instead of 1 that was one way but its changing and going more the generic standard multiplayer way.

------

the part that seems the most messed up to me is the way game development has been going lately, now a days game devs release a game still in Beta with glitchs and functions not even working but are still charging ppl full price at the start, then as they update and fix the game over a few years and get it to a final release then they open it for free to play to make the money off the in-game transactions they planned to be the money maker, so they are using us as Beta testers but make us pay for it too?

back in the day you got a game for free in Beta till it was finished and polished, then you paid for it to play, the early access tag is pretty much useless now lol cuz every AAA game title ends up doing this now (-_-) using automated systems to report bugs from players to them, and a lot of times they dont even fix it they just decide if its vital to functionality and if modders will probably fix it themselves. (which i dont mind game devs relying on our talented modification community and having a mutual relationship that benefits all players and the devs. . . but not like this)

I dont endorse these channels or even 100% agree with all that is said and represented, but this user is speaking on the same kind of issues with Fallout 76 and bringing up info on the topic, making a paid game without micro transactions at 1st for users to buy, mis representing / dishonesty with the games point and changing to micro pays and eventually a free to play system after another year or 2 (when sales drop enough more than likely) cuz they are really just testing how much they can section up their game and sell it separately or ""bait and switch"" the price.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aETXRgaL40

Unfortunately they wanna push the gaming industry as far as they can into the same type of areas as other corporate businesses in production of a good, but what they didnt plan on is that gaming and video game (or i like to use the term ""virtual experience"" more than game) development world hasnt been around long enough for them to make it look like its so ridiculously hard and unheard of for games to be made and companies to function any other way than the AAA game devs are in 2018, so everyone is wise to what is bull and what is not, if it was 100 years later than now so games have been around for at least 1 generation of lifetime they probably would have gotten away with this crap without anyone batting an eye.

so we customers and consumers must decide reasonably ourselves as well what a reasonable line is on game development from our stand point (and again im not 100% knocking micro transactions in games just how its done, nor am i accusing Valve of exactly the same behavior as they are one of the last ones avoiding this corporization with game devs, although im slightly worried lately), and im definitely not saying game and game engine development is ""easy"" or a simple thing to do by any means but im sure its not as bad as they seem to wanna make it look like, so game devs should be able to make some bank (high profits) but things are getting ridiculous to where its not even funny anymore. (and the worst part is game devs arent even getting most of the money from these shady deals, its the publishers so we must help our actual game devs as well)

to end with which i feel like i shouldnt have to mention but just in case, plz do not rage and actually legit harass anyone in the game industry or it hurts all of our cause, its about a healthy mutual relationship.

* There has also been a lot of beef around whats called ""review bombing"" which i kinda find silly so hopefully we can clarify, a review bombing is when ppl negatively review something with no info or logic basis and just want to negatively impact it or the ppl playing, which is not the same as a lot of ppl raging for good reason and putting something unconstructively negative on their review.

but when a lot of ppl with a legitiment grievences post their reviews its literally just trying to communicate with other players and the game makers just like discussion threads, so its not a bad thing to voice your opinion in your review just make sure you arent doing it for the sake of doing it with no real thought process to it or just cuz everyone else is, otherwise once again it just starts to make everything look bad even when theres good reasons.

2012 came and we all got excited.
What is this a new counter strike game? Finally are they going to fix the stuff that was wrong with css?
Well I ended up playing it for a week and my thoughts was negative.
More then a year I did not play it. I did not have fun and the game felt broken we laughed and made fun of the xbox version. All the sudden people started to play it they said it was fixed.
You could customize the skins on your weapons this was a new beginning for global offensive.

Matchmaking was fun and you got matched with people with the same rank as you and we tried to rank up.
it was fun we had fun ranking and destroy the enemy team.
But then we realized that the creators didn't care we had lack of updates.
And the developers just made lazy skin updates and not fixing the games problems.
This was a downright spiral for cs:go. Sadly we don't have the game that we could have if they listen to the professional players that gave them their thoughts on the game.
We had and still have cheaters and bad servers on mm and this is my biggest problem with the game.
it is true that they tried fix the cheating problem with a system called prime.

But they completely fcked it up and here is why. If you want to play mm before ranking up your private rank to 21
you have to play on a non prime account. That means that you play on a server that is not as secure as a prime account
and that means cheaters.

Whats the problem why not just rank up your private rank to 21 can't be that hard?
cs:go casual servers are CANCER there is no casual Matchmaking. You play on a map that are supposed to have max 5 players in each team Casual game mode has 10 players on each team.
the casual game mode is literally unplayable and i'm pretty sure it takes years to rank up too level 21 on casual.
the current state of the game is very frustrating and I can't believe we are letting the developers do something like this to a game big as this!
Valve please wake up you guys are publishing a game that is not the quality that is valve material.
Didn't you guys make high quality games and if you guys don't make games anymore don't mark yourself as a game developer company because you guys act like Trump.

[h1] The Game[/h1]
This game was my life since 2012 i started playing it on xbox then moved to pc some months later cause' its PC game :D anyway this game was my passion because i loved it so much but nowadays it has THE WORST COMMUNITY EVER 
-Russians (which you find in 90% of the matchs)
-Hackers
-Smurfs who can't play at their level cuz their bad
CS:GO has become a gambling and cheating simulator . Most people, not even gamers, only see the illusion that they can win some super rare knife instead of playing the game. It was the obnoxious ""Arms Deal"" update that struck down CS:GO into a trash game and the later updates only made it worse or did nothing to improve it. Don't believe me? Since micro-transactions were introduced, floods of scamming bots sent me friend invites in attempt to trick me and for weeks, I had to reject and block them. Yes, it stopped but the damage was done. Lots of idiots could not see past their greed and lost their items and complained so much to Steam support that they implemented those Steam Market policies that punished everyone who uses the market. 
Also, the community is toxic, more toxic that an irradiated area of Chernobyl. The community hub is filled with threads at the top page that complain about getting a VAC ban, trade scam, or competitive ban around 90%. The other 10% is usually a giveaway. The community is also hostile to any sort of criticism, calling out anyone who dares to criticize their ""holy"" game as ""silvers"", ""noobs"", etc and thus become narcissistic in what they think is their own right. Guess what? I played the game long before the ""Arms Deal"" update and the community was not like this. It was a decent game and it was much, much better without nearly everyone clobbering over a virtual item
So for the love of god before starting this wonderful ruined game just think at it and if you want my advice don't play it please you will just waste your time like i did i will definitely stop this game
They keep updating the game frequently, but forget to update some important core elements... This game have been out for years now and they still haven't fixed some of the examples I will mention here: (and also i quit this game due to unfriendly players and lots of lots of lots of lots of cheaters, this game died when they failed with the revolver update, i dont mean the game died in a way that nobody is playing it anymore.... it died in a way were it is infested with negative players, hating on people for no reason, kicking people cause they can for no reason, mean comments, ""ez ez ez"" all the time when someone is losing, i cant reccomend this game anymore. It's just a hate simulator... Dont get my wrong, game is awesome, but the people who play it and the way they act against others is a disgrace, people have no respect at all.)
I also wish they would fix things like being able to enter options menu while in a lobby..

* Lots of bugs with GUI 
* Joining a lobby with the screen not changing 
* Going into mic settings and losing all mouse and keyboard input in-game 
* Mouse stops working on menu screens 
* Can't type in chat in lobby
* Mini-map / radar dissapears only white dots of players visible
* Joining a server when a match have ended and the votemap is over, makes a annoying soundbug witch contiunes the next game, only way to stop the sound is to restart the game..
* Stuck on MOTD screen and cant play 
* Changes in fps_max causes up to 2x more loading times and vice verca

[h1] Off-Topic [/h1]
Also the bots in this game are the biggest trolls and rebels know to earth:
You tell them to hold a position, they reply ""negative"". 
And when they do after a bit they just walk away. 
And then get themselves killed. 
Oh, and they don't buy for the team. 
Oh, and they also buy the weirdest crap and don't buy armour half the time.
They especially love buying dak daks and shotguns on save rounds. 
Also, on the odd occasion, when they get flashed, they will just spray and pray, along with throwing random nades towards your location.
They shouldn't be called bots, but rather silver players. 
Wierdly they always seem to aim for your D(i)ck
I really can't tell the difference between the two.﻿
They have wallhack

5064,"This game sucks big time. I'm global with 5k hours and valve has destroyed it. CS:GO is dead.

Reasons:

1) 64 tick servers. 128 tick is incredibly important or else the game is impossible to play. I can't join 64 tick servers without my computer bursting in flames from how old it is, just like 64 tick. That stuff is technology from the '60s. Every other game I play online has 512 tick servers, we're not asking for much.

2) Cheaters. Everywhere I go there's cheaters. I have never cheated. I only use a slight aim assistance so I can compete with the rest of global cheaters. My teammates are always braindead and can't even turn on their own computer so I always end up losing because of them. Whenever they teamkill me I teamkill them back but then I get 7 day ban instantly while they get nothing. This is unfair and the game is dead because of it. There is also no anti-cheat, VAC is a joke and valve only spends resources making more ugly covert skins that'll end up in a case no one cares about.

3) The price. It should be $600 dollars so no cheaters will buy it ever again. Only the most dedicated players will acquire this game, which is how it should be. The noobs at silver can suck it, they are not people.

4) Skins. Valve destroyed their game with the trade ban back in march, now my $2500 dollar inventory is only worth $2450. Complete waste of money.

5) The matchmaking system. I'm global so I no longer have a reason to play. They should add 18 more ranks after global. Silvers can go eat dirt... that is, if they're smart enough to do that. Ranking systems are the only reason I use a computer nowadays.

6) The UI. This game looks like a game made in the '90s, and they recently killed support for scaleform, the previous ui, in favor of panorama, a piece of dogfood ui made for kids that haven't even reached puberty. I willl not open this game again because I hate change and I don't want to learn a new ui. I don't trust anyone that says it has improved at all, it's probably the misinformed silvers talking nonsense.

7) Lack of gamemodes. Competitive is the only gamemode I play, the rest have no ranks. If you want to play anything other than competitive you have to go to community servers run by incompetent admins who ban you for being too good. They also lack ranks so they're a complete waste of time.

8) The absence of unranked competitive. Casual is a cheatfest that doesn't resemble real CS. They should add an unranked 5v5 mode so I can play with my noob eagle friends and finally have fair matches.


All the above points are a brief description of how bad this game is. CS:GO is an incredibly terrible purchase for anyone that hasn't already made the mistake of buying it. I hope that in the future they will also make it so noobs can't buy the game at all. Make them pass an IQ test first, because everyone in the silver ranks lacks the intelligence that characterizes human beings. Therefore they're not people and have no rights.

Until they fix matchmaking I'll go play ESEA and FACEIT. I spelled those with proper capitalization because they earned the right. They actually care about the game, unlike valve.

You either have someone on your team flaming you for not winning a 1v5 clutch, or someone on the other team thinks you are cheating. There is no inbetween. 
This is purely the fault of the developers for not including an anti cheat into the biggest FPS esports title ever, and for doing nothing about toxic behavior. There is no consequence for either. You can call someone a cunt or download a spinbot to your heart's content, even with expensive skins on your account, you have nothing to worry about. There is no anti cheat.
On top of all of this, the game isn't actually included in the game. If you want to play CS the way the pros do, or the way previous versions were played, you need to download a third party service. Think of how absurd that is. THE GAME ISN'T IN THE GAME. COMPETITIVE DOESN'T EVEN HAVE FUCKING OVERTIME. It's completely retarded.

I will just start that I have been playing CS over 10 years and I really enjoy the Competetive matchmaking function of the game, but there is more to it...

I have played this game more than 500 hours, and for 3 years, the stupid hitboxes still haven't been fixed, the amount of cheaters are insane, even in Prime matches, I remember playing 6 competetive matches in a row against blatant cheaters - the VAC is a joke - and non existant if you play the game on Linux based systems. The shooting feels too random, you can say that spraying and shooting takes skill in this game, but I don't remember ever raging in CS 1.6 or CSS that I just can't hit a target which is not moving. 

The casual games are pretty dull and boring, people usually leave the lobbies after few minutes and you can enjoy fun game against bots. 

Also there was a planned upgrade to source 2 engine, which for some reason still haven't happened, lots of players had high hopes on it.

And lately the matchmaking feels super slow, maybe people are just leaving the game, because it just goes downhill with no updates from the developers.

Now frankly, I'll admit when I first started, I was garbage at the game. At the time I had actually had ~20 competitive wins, and at the time there was no leveling up. Then, Valve updated the game and added levels. With all my competitive wins (even when I was new), I couldn't play competitve. I had gotten to around Silver 4 as well, which may not be far for some, but for me I was happy to hear it.  

Now I hate the game in its entirety, maybe for dumb reasons, but here they were. 
-Leveling up was tedious, took forever, and honestly should be a little more linent IMO. Feel free to disagree if you wish, but getting to level three took me forever. 
-The community is attrocious, players having to leave and asking to be kicked, some team mates screaming at you in a rather high pitched voice because you failed a 1v1 (which, albiet yeah git gud and all, but come on, getting angry is a little obsesive when I'm doing decent as is). 
-Although you can get cases for free, I don't see a single way to get keys for free. All for one skin? No thanks, I'd rather buy some Overwatch Loot Crates, I'm garunteed 4 of something in those and you can get those handed out. I'm not paying 2.50 for ONE skin.

In random competitive matchmaking in like 15 matches out of 20 at least someone on the team doesn't speak English and in like 7 out of 10 matches there is at least one toxic player who blames someone else (be it teammates or enemy) for their problems.

The game is pretty nice if you want to train your tolerance to rage from other people, especially if you like when people explode even more from you being polite and cheerful, and all right if you know how to deal with that.

CS GO was something very special to me as this was the first game to show me the competitive side of many different games and gave me the courage to transition from games like CoD and BF and pretty much became a part of me overtime as it made me to think differently about the way that games can be played but as some people say ""All good things must come to an end!"" isn't? Here it ends.

As the time passed on. We can see that Valve barely supports the game and this can be noticed by the lack of proper updates to the game and less listening to it's community.
The promise in 2017 for the Panorama UI? It's almost mid 2018 and still nothing about it
The matchmaking being at it's worst state like it's never been like before
Lack of new maps and operations, Some of you may remember that we had 2-3 operations a year? Now we are barely getting only 1 a year (That's if we are lucky enough to get).
5vs5 unranked matchmaking (With a sort of hidden Normal MMR)? Nope
The option to play on official MM with 128tick? Nope, Rely on 3rd party services to do so
No Server selection? Come on Valve, Even Dota2 does that...
And I can continue with the list but why I should do it? You already got the point I guess so.

After I bought it I didn't play it for atleast 8 months. Until I had 40kr on my steam wallet (4eur).

5124,"Good game, with amazing potential. But lack of developer trancparency and rampant cheating will lead to it's downfall.

Lets start this off by saying V.A.C. is a joke... it doesn't do much other than be a meme for the community to bash on. Valve makes billions of micro transaction and yet does nothing to improve player experience by cracking down on cheater and hackers. Every low skill competetive game is full of smurfs (players with alot of experience playing in lower level games) and or hackers. Valves overwatch program catches non cheating players who happen to have a streak of good games/plays, and fails to capture the ""closet hackers"" - or people who using hacks, but play a style that makes it seem that don't. 

""Prime Matchmaking"" failed to deliver on it's goal of seperating out cheatings/smurfs from players who wan't to play against players their skill level and have a good time. It was a good idea, worked at first, but if a player can get a program undetectable by VAC, how hard is it for them to buy Prime Ready Accounts, and get access to a phone number?

Rumors have been spreading on community forums that Valve is in the works of a ""Super VAC"" yet it's been 5 or so years since the games launch, and they yet to deliver on anything more than in game accessories (gun skins, stickers, music kits, GLOVES, pins, etc) and questionable mechanic changes. I understand they want to make money - but who is going to buy their products when no one is around because of the shakey servers and toxic/hacking community.

I'm extremely disappointed in Valve - like many others, this review will get drowned in the vastness of QQ and phony reviews. There is only one way to getting Valve to act...

Boycott all Valve microtransactions. I'm am no longer buying any more products through Counter Strike or any other valve game until they make reforms to match making. When they have they revenue stream in jeopardy - only then will they listen to player/community concerns and start making changes we want/need to see.

For current players, I feel your struggle, hear your cries, and share your rage. Stop purchacing valve skins, keys, kits, pins, whatever. Stop using the community market and boycott all valve micro transactions.

For future players - hold off from playing this game, the current experience will only turn you away and make your want to quit before you have seen the small glimor of light that is the csgo community. As well, don't purchase the game unless you are ready to pay 5$ a month for a 3rd party subscrition in order to have a decent competetive experience.

Valve Has quickly been reducing my trust in their game development teams for a while now. I mean when the R8 came out did they not do ANY QA and playtesting on it? the fact that they fixed it fast was nice, but STILL. the games hacker base has been growing most keys used by them are grey market and cheap. Valve knows hackers are a problem thus overwatch and prime status. Then It goes F2P and BR. Valve i would ask for a refund but i'm not gonna get it, I will NEVER touch this game again this community was already as toxic as league of legends if not more so and worse than Fortnite. Its about to get worse than all toxic cumminies combined. VAC isnt gonna be the only issue, Ban statistics my ass. Buying your way into prime is the most greedy thing i've seen. Gaben please understand you make so much money a month you can pay your servers for a year and a half, i mean how bout you give us an entire breakdown of your income and expenses i'm sure there are multiple people with accounting degrees who can tell you if doing what you do even makes sense. They can even do it for free and post it on reddit. It seems like game companies these days are following in evil EA's footsteps monoplizing on their users trust. Bethesda,EA/Bioware/Epic Games/Microsoft/Blizzard/etc. All these companies have betrayed their fans trust for the sake of profit. don't add your name to that list Valve, I'll just use crazy amazon for my gaming needs if you dont get your head out of your ass.",FALSE

Go to play competitive and get absolutely dunked on, take infinite verbal abuse from teammates in multiple languages for 30 minutes, try not to cry, then they kick me in the last round. Rinse, Repeat, still at 0/8. MMR for skill based match making never updates (or doesn't exist) so for my next game I'm still playing with people way too good for me.  I know the terminology and maps, I just take longer than .0000001s to aim my headshots.

5177,"From my experience, a large majority of matches end up being terribly boring, this has been the case in both recent casual sessions with friends and matches played years ago in competitive/casual. 

The slow-paced methodical gameplay is meant to create tension, you can easily observe this watching e-sport matches, but when actually playing all it does for me is frustrate and bore. It's mainly an issue for me as the player base itself seems to propagate this meta which I find rather rigid and thus unengaging, emphasising what I perceive to be a slow game.

Obviously CS:GO is not my cup of tea, of course, your experience may differ wildly from my own and you may find yourself enjoying it.

5213,"There are some bad games out there but this one takes the crown. It s not even a opinion. This is the worst game ever.
First of all, let s talk about the game:
1.It s full of bugs, and I mean FULL of bugs. Molotovs not doing damage, shots that 100% should connect don t, you can see through smokes, flashes don t flash, when u are shifting it makes sound cues and the list goes on.
2.Matchmaking is GARBAGE, downright TRASH. If you wish to play free and grind to level 21 to get the prime status you will go through hell. In every match there will be a cheater, either raging or legitting, always one.
Bu one could think that prime is saving them but it s not. Maybe in silver or gold nova you will get actual legit players but from master guardian and up 4 out of 5 matches you will get legit cheaters. Reporting does absolutely NOTHING, spinbotters with private cheats never get banned, I actually have one in my friends list with almost 900 hours only with spinbot and he s fine. Overwatch doesn t work, VAC is a JOKE, it detects nothing, not even the free ones. A 3rd party software has a better matchmaking that the game itself
To put the cherry on top, not only you get to play with cheaters but you also have to endure the toxic, tryhard players that will track you down to murder you from one small mistake.
Now the community: One of the worst to ever exist. Cheaters, tryhards, toxics, griefers, mic abusers, scammers. I could count the actual good players on my fingers.
3.Now the company. With the exception of EA this is the most profit driven company out there. They do nothing to stop the cheaters, they do nothing to balance the game, yet you have cases because who doesn t want to waste money on pixels, am I right? They are not even testing guns(revolver and aug case).
In conclusion, never buy this game if you have standards, a life and want to actually play a fun game.

5255,"Dear Valve,

I've spent a lot of time playing this game, but each update makes it a less appealing game to play. The ""Danger Zone"" update is the worst thing that could have happened to CS:GO. Making it free to play is ridiculous, you should have raised the price, to reduce the amount of cheaters. Make them bleed for every time they lose an account due to hacking. But I guess, that this isn't your main priority. Just release another case, that will fix all problems... 

Upgrading every account to Prime is literally a free-hacking-pass for all those shady account owners. Since the Trust Factor is working as great as it does, why would you need such a thing as Prime, huh? Really awesome idea to get rid of the last little thing that helped to get a legit MM lobby.

The Battle Royal mode is a pure waste of time. Why would I need another BR game? That is not why I play CS:GO. Maybe concentrate on the things that made CS:GO as popular as it is and improve them. No idea how long it took you to develop this game mode, but I'm sure, there is a better way to spent your ressources. I know that this comment doesn't do anything to fix all these massive problems CS:GO has right now, but I still have a glimmer of hope.

Good bye CS:GO! We had some great moments, but now it's time to let go.

Prime required you attaching a phone number to the account to prevent smurfing and having multiple accounts from which you can cheat, so that went to shit if they just promoted everyone to Prime just because they played the game before the update. Now Prime only gives a chance to receive hats, boxes and other ""exclusive"" skins worth a few cents

Don't want to support the hats and skins business anymore, Valve should make us pay their salaries by buying their games, possible great games that could come like Half-Life 3, Portal 3, Left4Dead3. Instead they killed them for easy money..

From 2016 this game turned into a frustrating mess, basically CoD with recoil. I'm SMFC and still can't understand how so much rank difference can get into a game.

5288,"Hardly anything in “Counter-Strike: Global  Offensive” will surprise you, except how well it does nearly all the things audiences want and expect it to do. 

Counter-Strike: Global Offensive (CS:GO) is a 2012 multiplayer first-person shooter developed by Valve and Hidden Path Entertainment. It is the fourth game in the Counter-Strike series. Developed for over two years, Global Offensive was released for Windows, macOS, Xbox 360, and PlayStation 3 in August 2012, and for Linux in 2014. Valve still regularly updates the game, both with smaller balancing patches and larger content additions.

The game pits two teams, Terrorists and Counter-Terrorists, against each other in different objective-based game modes. The most common game modes involve the Terrorists planting a bomb while Counter-Terrorists attempt to stop them, or Counter-Terrorists attempting to rescue hostages that the Terrorists have captured. There are nine official game modes, all of which have distinct characteristics specific to that mode. The game also has matchmaking support that allows players to play on dedicated Valve servers, in addition to community-hosted servers with custom maps and game modes. A battle-royale game-mode, ""Danger Zone"", was introduced in December 2018.

Global Offensive received positive reviews from critics on release, who praised the game for its gameplay and faithfulness to the Counter-Strike series, though it was criticized for some early features and the differences between the console and PC versions. Since its release, it has drawn in an estimated 11 million players per month and remains one of the most played games on Valve's Steam platform. In December 2018, Valve transitioned the game to a free-to-play model, focusing on revenue from cosmetic items.

The game has an active esports scene, continuing the history of international competitive play from previous games in the series. Teams compete in professional leagues and tournaments, and Global Offensive is now one of the largest global esports. It has been awarded ""Best eSports Game"" at The Game Awards 2017, The Game Awards 2019 and The Game Awards 2020 shows.",FALSE

5327,"The English word ""barbecue"" and its cognates in other languages come from the Spanish word barbacoa. Etymologists believe this to be derived from barabicu found in the language of the Arawak people of the Caribbean and the Timucua people of Florida;[3][page needed] it has entered some European languages in the form of the aforementioned barbacoa. The Oxford English Dictionary (OED) traces the word to Hispaniola and translates it as a ""framework of sticks set upon posts"".[4]

Gonzalo Fernández De Oviedo y Valdés, a Spanish explorer, was the first to use the word ""barbecoa"" in print in Spain in 1526 in the Diccionario de la Lengua Española (2nd Edition) of the Real Academia Española. After Columbus landed in the Americas in 1492, the Spaniards apparently found Taíno roasting meat over a grill consisting of a wooden framework resting on sticks above a fire. The flames and smoke rose and enveloped the meat, giving it a certain flavor.[5]

Traditional barbacoa involves digging a hole in the ground and placing some meat—usually a whole lamb—above a pot so the juices can be used to make a broth. It is then covered with maguey leaves and coal, and set alight. The cooking process takes a few hours. Olaudah Equiano, an African abolitionist, described this method of roasting alligators among the Mosquito People (Miskito people) on his journeys to Cabo Gracias a Dios in his narrative The Interesting Narrative of the Life of Olaudah Equiano.[6]

Linguists have suggested the word was loaned successively into Spanish, then Portuguese, French, and English. In the form barbacado the word was used in English in 1648 by the supposed Beauchamp Plantagenet in the tract A description of the province of New Albion: ""the Indians in stead of salt doe barbecado or dry and smoak fish"".[7]

According to the OED, the first recorded use in modern form was in 1661, in Edmund Hickeringill's Jamaica Viewed: ""Some are slain, And their flesh forthwith Barbacu'd and eat"";[4] it also appears in 1672 in the writings of John Lederer following his travels in the North American southeast in 1669–70.[8] The first known use as a noun was in 1697 by the English buccaneer William Dampier. In his New Voyage Round the World, Dampier wrote, ""...and lay there all night, upon our Borbecu's, or frames of Sticks, raised about 3 foot from the Ground"".[9]

As early as the 1730s, New England Puritans were familiar with barbecue, as on November 4, 1731, New London, CT resident Joshua Hempstead wrote in his diary: ""I was at Madm Winthrops at an Entertainment, or Treat of Colln [Colonel] or Samll Brownes a Barbaqued."" [See Diary of Joshua Hempstead (New London: New London Historical Society, 1901), p. 241.] Samuel Johnson's 1756 dictionary gave the following definitions:[10]",FALSE

Too good a game to not let go when you should go to bed? Almost, but no...

CHEATERS. CHEATERS. CHEATERS - that the answer to my uninstall. 

There are soooo many cheaters in this game and it ruins it. Round after round you run in to cheater upon cheater. 
Some rounds you actually get to the end of the game with the cheater - easy to realize when the map is cleared almost before it started and the last 4-5 kills was a headshots in short times interval. And the realization that it has been a waste of time - cause there is nothing in the world you can do to win against a player that sees you through the walls that are solid to you. Only thing more certain than the wast of time is the frustration that follows. 

Reporting the cheaters? Even more waste of time. Looking on their profiles and some cheaters are almost bragging about it here, along with the ill worded comments form others players that have also wasted time an money on this game. 

So after many hours trying to look through the cheating, I have now uninstalled for a long cool down. 
Might return .. never say never they say.

I know that some parents may be thinking that this game will ruin children, well guess what i am 12 years old and also i play good and am the top fragger in most of the games. 

Only don't allow children if they are young and play bad. Support them or encourage them if they are over 13 years and play good 

This game is also a future for me and other people. If your children get angry and have a bad response towards you, then there is one solution. Share what happened with them, discuss with what was there.

And also most importantly to improve allow them only 1 hour and don't make them leave the in-game match as it would also have a bad effect, stay there, and see if the match has ended.

Make them leave if its very important, and most importantly players if your parents are calling you, rush up to them as it would show that you are responsible for them.


Overall this game is good for elder people, but if children are playing follow the above tips to improve

If you are looking for a better MM experience then FACEIT or ESEA are your best bet. Giving Prime to every user who bought the game was a total joke.

5732,"This game is very addicting, although not in a positive way. There's so many flaws to this game and the only reason to keep playing it is, well... because it's CSGO. First off, let's talk about the random spikes in ping that I don't get on any other game ever. Myself as well as multiple of my friends have experienced sudden spikes in ping on the game during a match while in combat for some weird reason, and these spikes are like some I never get in any other game so It's definitely not my internet. Second off, the hitregs in this game rarely ever make sense. Taking in fact the many countless times that I've had the unpleasant experience of doing 1 damage to opposing player's health with 1 hit from an AK or an M4 (What, did I hit the player in his pinky finger or something? Surely it wouldn't take a 100 rounds to kill someone, right?), as well as times when even many of my video recordings have proven that CSGO's hitreg is absurd at its finest, as an example, once during a match one of the opposing players had crouched in a corner and I sprayed him at point blank range with an AK and after dying it showed up as if I haven't even hit him once, but when he moved away from the corner, you could see bullet holes in the wall right where he was crouching right at a reasonable height to do severe damage, so what... Did the bullets just mysteriously pass through the enemy's body without actually doing any damage? Third point - the matchmaking and teammates that go along with it. Rarely do I ever match with someone of my capabilities in my team and the teammates are always as if they're two rank grades below me, and probably everyone from northern Europe knows that literally 95% of the time they're toxic Russians with an attitude that are clueless of what they're talking about, so a bit of a variety of origin would be a great start for improvement in the teammates that you get matched with. And last but not least, the ranking system. I think a lot of CSGO players would agree that the ranking system is completely absurd in this game. There's countless of cases where I've seen players literally a whole grade in the ranking system above me but they play as if they're a whole grade below me, yet I can't get ranked up to that grade even though I clearly play atleast three times better, so why's that... ? Well, for one, like I said a lot of the times it's your team that digs a hole and throws you in it, because most of the times your teammates are clueless, toxic but still somehow rank the same as you do even though they can't play on your level, for two, the ranking system itself just either overestimates or underestimates your true capabilities in the game, therefore, giving you a false rank, which makes you match with players either below you or above you, making the whole match just completely unbalanced and complete chaos. Never ever has the score between all players in one team been balanced during random matchmaking. There's always somebody with an incredibly low score at the bottom and someone who's carrying the whole team by himself at the top. Make the judgements for yourself and if you don't agree with me, that's fine, but I do in fact know that what I said is true and the ranking system as well as matchmaking is by far the worst and what's making several people deep down hate on the game.",FALSE

1: Actually free, you don’t have to pay $20 to get into “prime”
2: Actual Anti cheat, VAC (Valve Allowed Cheats) is a joke and everyone knows it
3: No temporary bans from getting reported. Unlike CS GO, Valorant has dedicated moderators to determine if you’re toxic instead of just going by player reports.
4: Less toxic player base
5: Skins that don’t cost as much as your car. 
6: no bots on online servers, the game actually makes sure the lobby is full.
7: Actual communication 
Counter Strike will soon be 40% Russian, 40% Chinese, and 20% gold nova r/globaloffensive neckbeards. Every sane person should move to valorant. A much better game

Advice to Rich People
1 Pay attention to this if you’re rich. Cry and moan about the misery that is coming to you. 2 Your riches have decayed, and your clothes have been eaten by moths. 3 Your gold and silver are corroded, and their corrosion will be used as evidence against you. Like fire, it will destroy your body.
You have stored up riches in these last days. 4 The wages you refused to pay the people who harvested your fields shout ⌊to God⌋ against you. The Lord of Armies has heard the cries of those who gather the crops. 5 You have lived in luxury and pleasure here on earth. You have fattened yourselves for the day of slaughter. 6 You have condemned and murdered people who have God’s approval, even though they didn’t resist you.
Be Patient
7 Brothers and sisters, be patient until the Lord comes again. See how farmers wait for their precious crops to grow. They wait patiently for fall and spring rains. 8 You, too, must be patient. Don’t give up hope. The Lord will soon be here. 9 Brothers and sisters, stop complaining about each other, or you will be condemned. Realize that the judge is standing at the door.
10 Brothers and sisters, follow the example of the prophets who spoke in the name of the Lord. They were patient when they suffered unjustly. 11 We consider those who endure to be blessed. You have heard about Job’s endurance. You saw that the Lord ended Job’s suffering because the Lord is compassionate and merciful.
Don’t Take Oaths
12 Above all things, my brothers and sisters, do not take an oath on anything in heaven or on earth. Do not take any oath. If you mean yes, say yes. If you mean no, say no. Do this so that you won’t be condemned.
Prayer Is Powerful
13 If any of you are having trouble, pray. If you are happy, sing psalms. 14 If you are sick, call for the church leaders. Have them pray for you and anoint you with olive oil  in the name of the Lord. 15 (Prayers offered in faith will save those who are sick, and the Lord will cure them.) If you have sinned, you will be forgiven. 16 So admit your sins to each other, and pray for each other so that you will be healed.
Prayers offered by those who have God’s approval are effective. 17 Elijah was human like us. Yet, when he prayed that it wouldn’t rain, no rain fell on the ground for three-and-a-half years. 18 Then he prayed again. It rained, and the ground produced crops.
Help Those Who Have Wandered Away from the Truth
19 My brothers and sisters, if one of you wanders from the truth, someone can bring that person back. 20 Realize that whoever brings a sinner back from the error of his ways will save him from death, and many sins will be forgiven.",FALSE

5871,"Alright as you can see I played this game for quite a while and I can tell you the following things...

Positive aspects:
- you can always learn new things 
- you actually gotta use your brain to win 
- this community has a ton of awesome people 
- community servers are nice 
- exciting eSport- tournaments 
- pure statisfaction if you hit shit 
- perfect game to play with friends because you can try out various tactics and there are a lot of funny ways to troll them or the enemies
- definitely gives you old school tactical shooter vibes (if you ignore all these colorful but good looking skins). Something we should really appreciate in the age of Battle royals and Call of Duty).

Negative aspects:
- way too many hackers. Adding the free none prime edition  was one of the baddest decisions Valve ever made (despite not publishing HL3 lol) . It’s almost impossible to enjoy a game with a friend  who is new to the game  because playing none Prime became a guarantee for a game full of cheaters. 
- Valve doesn’t seem to put a lot of effort into Counter Strike. Apparently they just rely on the name of the game- and it works. Updates are often full of bugs and...not very well tested, Valve seems to ignore the wishes of the community and until this day the Servers are sh*t which is pretty sad if you consider what a big company Valve is.
- Never understood why killing a team mate at the spawn results in an insta kick?
- Solo queque is disgusting


To sum things up: CS:Go is a good competitive shooter that will always challenge you. On your journey you can meet a lot of nice people (and a lot of annoying, unnice people). This game can (especially with friends) be a lot fun but also quite the opposite- absolutely annoying especially if you solo queque.
Also Valve doesn’t seem to put any effort into this game and they wait quite some time until they listen to the community‘s recommendations.
Getting into Counter Strike is overall a very fun thing to do but you should think about whether you really want that because you definitely will have to put a lot of time into this game and even though most people do that they stay a shitty player (just like me with 999h). 
You will find a big community, a huge esport scene and an interesting game (definitely not a chill one though).

Consider that while playing this infuriating shit you could play other awesome games or actually do something with your life xD (felt like I have to say that since I saw many people during my time in this game who have scary amounts of hours playtime in two weeks..imagine that it is almost common to play this game for 2.5 days in 14 days. 
I am glad that I made that experience but I’m not sure whether I would recommend my younger self to get into it.

EDIT: And now after recent update there's like a lot of cheaters xD i mean A LOT, like, there are only 4 normal players, few bots given when there are not many palyers and rest of the players are just CHEATERS so it's getting even worse xDDD, congrats valve xD
before i didn't encounter any cheater, maybe once but that's all, now in every match there are like at least 4-6 cheaters xDDDDDD

Valve: updates anti-cheat that doesn't allow 3rd party apps to run in background (even obs) and first time starts in safe mode or smth that supposedly stops cheats and 3rd party apps

csgo: even more cheaters, script kiddos, bots and other shit AFTER UPDATE, ON SAFE MODE (or wth it's called), WITH VAC, ON OFFICIAL SERVERS

- I dont need to talk about your system im premium guy with 1000+ hours and you give me guy who have 30 hours and level 0 on steam?
 
- Solo/Q :sometime i get full premade vs 5 random people - its perfect.

- Last competive i played i was gold nova master and i get a guy who is level 0 on steam and he is having  5 hours in game - he didnt even know to buy gun.

""S U G G E S T I O N "" If you dont have full squad to play competitive then dont play it. This game will only waste your time in life and make you toxic.

- Fix servers,what im doing on Poland,Russian,or American server? Im from Europe so i want to play on Europe servers...

- If you are new player and you didnt think about to buy prime status dont you dare to download game, cheaters are everywhere (But if you really like game go play on Faceit).

- By the way danger zone is not optimized at all - From 150 + FPS in Competitive to 40 in Danger Zone.

- Overwatch i litterly wasting a time for nothing,i watched so much overwatch and 97% of that were cheaters with spinbot of that 97% i mayget get like 20 match bonus xp..

-Its sad this game is not bad in any case but devlopers dont give a f*ck about players money is important and very soon csgo will be dead game or pay to win you will see ....really sad..

- I can talk like this for days how about this game is slowly falling down apart like 

- I don't see the point that I can't play a single match with a friend because he didn't pay? what csgo is free but still has to be paid? So you are telling that CSGO is free but you need to pay for them?

- I spent a lot of hours and I don't regret it, it was interesting, I had someone to play with, but I wouldn't recommend tearing such nerves to anyone.

10.9.2021. - What an epic competitive system i as guy MG1 and my premade friend as GN2 get 3 premade Russians (those boys were Silvers) and for our enemy we get 4 LEM and 1 Global Elite if you want go see screenshots..., and they were full premade (HAHA VALVE)

Уважаемые Valve. Сейчас в игре вижу три основные проблемы и ситуации, с которыми сталкивается каждый.
1. Заходит новичок в игру. Игру, в которую играли его друзья, хвалили и хорошо отзывались. В которой есть медали за 10 лет игры! С первой же катки (Не важно, мм, напарники) читеры. Буквально 7/10 игр с читерами в своей или вражеской команде. Желание играть дальше у этого человека будет? У меня вот быстро пропало.
2. Человек играет больше пяти лет, имеет хорошее звание, красиво и качественно стреляет. На него кидают репорт. Снижается траст-фактор, и этот игрок постоянно играет с читерами. Теряет звания, удовольствие от игры, etc.
3. Тот же человек имеет возможность смотреть патруль. А толку его смотреть? Ну забанят игрока. Забанят не по железу, а по аккаунту. Игра, напомню, бесплатная. Новый Staem, новый аккаунт - и все по новой.

В заключении хочу сказать, что да, сейчас игра на пике своего онлайна, но это скоро закончится. И репутацию вернуть будет очень, очень сложно. Лично я, пока не увижу новость о полной переработке античита либо о том что банить будут не аккаунты, а IP адреса, играть не хочу.",FALSE

Block cream cheese: Four 8-ounce blocks of full-fat cream cheese are the base of this cheesecake. That’s 2 pounds. Make sure you’re buying the blocks of cream cheese and not cream cheese spread. There’s no diets allowed in cheesecake, so don’t pick up the reduced fat variety!
Sugar: 1 cup. Not that much considering how many mouths you can feed with this dessert. Over-sweetened cheesecake is hardly cheesecake anymore. Using only 1 cup of sugar gives this cheesecake the opportunity to balance tangy and sweet, just as classic cheesecake should taste.
Sour cream: 1 cup. I recently tested a cheesecake recipe with 1 cup of heavy cream instead, but ended up sticking with my original (which can be found here with blueberry swirls!). I was curious about the heavy cream addition and figured it would yield a softer cheesecake bite. The cheesecake was soft, but lacked the stability and richness I wanted. It was almost too creamy. Sour cream is most definitely the right choice.
A little flavor: 1 teaspoon of pure vanilla extract and 2 of lemon juice. The lemon juice brightens up the cheesecake’s overall flavor and vanilla is always a good idea.
Eggs: 3 eggs are the final ingredient. You’ll beat the eggs in last, one at a time, until they are *just* incorporated. Do not overmix the batter once the eggs are added. This will whip air into the cheesecake batter, resulting in cheesecake cracking and deflating.
And as always, make sure all of the cheesecake batter ingredients are at room temperature so the batter remains smooth, even, and combines quickly. Beating cold ingredients together will result in a chunky over-beaten cheesecake batter, hardly the way we want to start!",FALSE

I am 27.

My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and adopted our son together. They are now both 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I found myself lost and miserable. I was self destructive. I got so mad one day from everything spiraling out of my control that I punched some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion. That caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand... my working hand... my games hand.. the hand that I held and carried my children to bed with.. The hand I desperately needed to make sure I could continue to provide.

After learning of the severity of my self-inflicted damage, I was borderline suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety. I have never had fits of rage, or been one to break down and cry, but I was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side.

Having nothing better to do, I searched for a game I could play, ONE HANDED while I recovered. I somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews. I decided that it had to be worth a shot... I must admit, I didn't beat the game, or play nearly as long as some of you. In fact, I may have only played this game a day or two.. With that being said, after doing so, I had a new found joy and hope for life. I was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me. I was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness. I was able to see the fruits of my ""labor"". I relaxed for 5 ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ minutes to this music long enough to realize that I was going to be okay.

After coming to that realization, I turned the game off, and I went back to work. It hurt my hand like hell but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself, and I became the father I needed to be in that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving as.

Today, I am close friend with my kids mother. We don't fight, or argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents, and friends.

I now have 3 kids. My third child is, wait for it, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my own separation, and we just stumbled in to each others life unexpectedly. We have been in a relationship for a year now, and are very happy together.

Moral of the story, you never know what life holds in store for you, and if I would have given up when all the odds were stacked against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

Quentin Tarantino is the Jerry Lee Lewis of cinema, a pounding performer who doesn't care if he tears up the piano, as long as everybody is rocking. His new movie ""Pulp Fiction"" is a comedy about blood, guts, violence, strange sex, drugs, fixed fights, dead body disposal, leather freaks, and a wristwatch that makes a dark journey down through the generations.

Seeing this movie last May at the Cannes Film Festival, I knew it was either one of the year's best films, or one of the worst.

Tarantino is too gifted a filmmaker to make a boring movie, but he could possibly make a bad one: Like Edward D. Wood Jr., proclaimed the Worst Director of All Time, he's in love with every shot - intoxicated with the very act of making a movie. It's that very lack of caution and introspection that makes ""Pulp Fiction"" crackle like an ozone generator: Here's a director who's been let loose inside the toy store, and wants to play all night.",FALSE

The saddest thing is that Steam refuses his head and washes his hands of all this, and the situation is essentially alarming. the game is no longer playable.",FALSE

6319,No,FALSE
6320,"Okay, where exactly do I start?!

I guess I start with the few postive aspects and I mainly will talk about the competitive part of the Game.

The Game itself is pretty nice
Pro:
1) Good sound engine and every weapon feels unique.
2) Good Performance: We have high fps, nearly no drops and a decent Server Connection.
3) Map Variety: Most Maps are very enjoyable and just slightly edited versions of the older CS/CSS Maps.
4) Many Modes: You can play Battle Royal ""Danger Zone"", Death Match to improve a specific weapon, community servers.
5) Competitive: I am just a huge fan of getting better and better and trying to reach a higher tier. This only made me grind the Game so hard.


Neutral:
Skins: There are really some dope Skins out there but dont you ever open cases. 
Its fucking scam...I invested more than 500 USD into this Game and got nothing but worthless blue shit skins. So just don't let yourself think you can make profit out of gambling...its NOT RANDOM with what you end up.


Now, lets talk about the things which made me even write this review.
Con:
1) A lot of f*cking cheating players! Some Cheaters play very obvious just to f*ck you up and some play more careful to make it look legit. But let me tell you there are thousands of cheaters in CS:GO.
2) VAC is the by far the worst Anti Cheat System ever!
3) CS:GO/Valve give zero f*cks about the fact, people are massive cheating in their Games. I believe, they rather wait over 180 days to ban a obviously cheating guy, because they hope he might invested money in Scam Cases and Skins...and if they got enough Money they might ban him
4) By the way seems like Overwatch is useless anway.
5) F2P Bullshit, made even more people hack.
6) Prime or Non Prime doesnt matter...you end up with Cheaters anyway
7) My Steam Level is 42, my Steam Account is nearly 12 Years old, I have 0 VAC Bans and I am still getting those Lvl 0, not even 1 Year old Accounts with maybe 3 friends in their list...seems about f*cking right.
8) Toxic and Troll Community
9) The whole Matchmaking itself! Whenever I search solo, me as a German, always getting matched with and/or against 5 Russians, Turks, Indians, Pakistani or even Chinese Player. Which is just stupid! Do not get me wrong here but the biggest problem here is the communication. You cant play a very competitive Game like Counter Strike with people who cant speak English at all. You cant tell me there are no people playing CS:GO in West Europe. 
How about giving a West Europe Player other players from West European Countries like: Germany, Britain, France, Spain, Netherlands, Denmark and so on...That cant be so hard.
I already set my matchmaking ping to 50...doesnt work and as I said the connection InGame is NOT a problem.
So always try to play with a FUL TEAM or with at least 1 or 2 Friends.

So if you want to play this game competitive try FACEIT.
There are not less cheaters and trolls but still there are some.
Otherwise dont waste your time in Competitive Matchmaking.
Ofc you can play DeathMatch or some other Game Modes but thats not a thing for me!

As long as this cheating epidemic is going on:

6324,FULL OF HACKERS!!!,FALSE
6325,Making this game Free To Play was a big mistake.,FALSE
6326,"game will be good if russians get their own server.
right now your love for russia and communisim needs to be all time high cuz other wise youll get kicked from every game.",FALSE
6327,"As much as I enjoy CS:GO, there's no way I would recommend anyone who didn't already have the game get into it. This game has gone through numerous revisions/additions, and not all of them have been for the better. It also has some long-standing problems that Valve doesn't seem to care to change. I'd like to say this now: I do enjoy this game, and would like to play with any friends that already own it and know what to expect, but I would not wish this game in its current state on any friend that wasn't already waist-deep in it.

I'll get this section out of the way first, since it's only a brief complaint. Skip to the next paragraph if you don't care about this topic. One of the most recent additions, the battle-royale mode, isn't particularly well done, but is harmless on its own, (having more options/playmodes is always better) but the latest Operation DLC forces you (in order to complete missions and progress) to play several modes that many players may not find enjoyable in the least, and whose core mechanics differ wildly from traditional gameplay. (Such as the battle-royale mode especially) I have heard several friends and other players bemoan the frequency of missions like that, as well as those particular game modes in general. On the other side of the coin, you have players who specifically play just for this mode who now have to endure a bunch of newcomers who are only playing for the sole purpose of completing a mission, with little care for how the actual match itself goes. I've already had a few partners complain about this when we discussed the topic during this mode. [b]That's the extent to which I'll discuss the optional, non-traditional game modes, because they really don't make up the core of CS:GO.[/b]

Now on to the main game. This game is old. I feel that it [i]has[/i] aged well, but not necessarily every part of it. Things like B-Hopping are an iconic staple of this game... but why? I don't believe it was designed into the game intentionally from the start. It's simply a quirk/exploit of the game's engine. Something that gives autistically skilled and/or obsessed players a small advantage over any casual player or even dedicated players who want to play for fun or friendly competition and not cheapen the experience. Another exploit along these lines is readying your weapon faster by quickly swapping weapons during reload animations. What sense does that make? It's something nobody should have to do, but gives players who want to be cheap another edge over the casual player, rather than just developing pure skill. It's also not realistic, which I only bring up because [b]on the CS:GO front page, it used to tout realism/accuracy in its portrayal of firearms. I specifically remember this because it influenced my decision to get this game years ago.[/b]

Let's discuss those ""accurate"" or ""realistic"" portrayals of firearms now. Reloading your weapon has a canned animation that takes [i]forever[/i] on some weapons. Why does it take so arbitrarily long to reload and ready a UMP-45 when the player character seems to have no trouble reloading the bizarre PP-Bizon, or expertly speed loading shells into any shotgun in the game? I feel as though the UMP and the CZ75 are the biggest offenders here. The reloading of the magazine itself is fairly quick, actually, but then there's this very slow arm movement back to the ready position after racking the slide/bolt. It's agonizing having a fully reloaded weapon pointed at an enemy ready to go... and your character is still moving their arm getting comfy. Just wasting time... and then you're dead. Finger on the fire button the entire time, waiting for the gun to fire, but nothing happens. Another issue with reload animations, [b]and this one is a big deal in terms of ""accuracy"",[/b] is that every. single. reload. requires the bolt/slide to be pulled back, wasting precious time, even if there is a round in the chamber. This doesn't make sense. You're wasting ammunition and taking up more time than needed. More importantly, it punishes players who keep an eye on their ammo and reload before they hit an empty mag. Shouldn't you be [i]rewarded[/i] with a more graceful and expedient reload time by not relying on auto-reload? No. Instead, to get that quick-reload bonus you have to take your eyes off the action to watch your magazine ammo count reset in the middle of a reload animation so you can swap out and swap back in your weapon again. This is somehow faster. Ridiculous.

The other big reason I can't recommend this game to anyone who isn't already into it, is due to the community. Search the net and you'll find people all over echoing the same things. ""Toxic community"", ""Too many trolls/griefers"", ""Too many hackers/cheaters"", ""Skins/Gambling culture has taken over"". Valve introduced Prime matching/verification, but it doesn't really make as much of a difference as it should. You still encounter numerous people joining games with their names as youtube links, spamming radical religious or racist or sexual content over the mic full blast. You still get people cheating blatantly and nobody doing anything about it because ""It's just casual, bro."" and when they do so in competitive, you have to take a loss and [i]hope[/i] that your reports actually add up to something eventually. At least most of the hacking takes place in casual, from what I can tell, so there's that. The ""toxic"" aspect of the community is hardly worth mentioning, though it is pretty bad. The general attitude toward women is not particularly pleasant, and when it comes to younger players, the resentment and mockery seems excessively harsh. There's always going to be d-bags in any game server, so it's no big surprise, it's just annoying in general. The obsession with skins and gambling is an obvious problem and sullies the culture but, hey, they're pretty and sparkly and it makes Valve monneeyyyyyyyy. So it's okay to have crammed down your throat, I guess. Yeah. [b]Don't buy this game if you're on the fence. If you already own it, well... [i]Misery loves company.[/i] Let's play.[/b]",FALSE

But thing I like about this game is that you can play the game for free or you can buy a premium account. But I definitely recommend you buy the game because on the free to play servers you'll only meet kids and hackers. 
But for testing the game, the free to play version is good and you'll find out if it's worth buying the game or not.

6397,"so guys, we did it, we reached a quarter of a million subscribers, 250,000 subscribers and still growing

the fact that we reached this number in such a short amount of time is just phenomenal i-im just amazed, thank you all so much

for supporting this channel and helping it grow I-I love you guys, you guys are just awesome.

so as you can probably tell this isnt really a montage parody, this is really more like a kind thank you / update video

so in this video im quickly gonna go over two things: firstly advertisements, and more importantly : the future of this channel

and what kind of direction its headed.

okay so firstly, the advertisements. believe it or not but montage parodies are actually a copy right minefield

new content is getting claimed every day. we could use something from.. lets say.. 5 years ago, and tommorow a huge company could come along

and claim that video as theres and we have no control over that. and any video we use that product in could either get

copy right stiked or lose monetizeation, meaning that all the money made from that video would get sent to the company, and not

us. the only real way to counter this is to get advertisements placed on my channel, i mean its a win-win for everyone involved

you know i get a safety net generated for myself and the company gets exposure and you guys, my sub subcribers, sit through a two

second ad that will be as short and painless as possible, so next im gonna talk about the future of this channel, this doesnt mean in anyway that im actually quitting montage parodies, its basically why you subscribed to my channel and i enjoy making them and

theres no reason to quit because im in full time education i have less time to make and upload videos it use to be weekly uploads

and now its pretty much once a month but in my opinion uploading once a month isnt enough id like to upload more than that, i mean, as much as possible

but montage parodies take a long time to make, collecting the resources, coming up with an original idea ya know, all this stuff takes

time and planning and that combined with me being in education means that they take a while to make, a good video that goes into

detail about this is rubber rosses video ""future of independant animation on youtube"" it is a different theme'd video because I

dont do independant animation, but you can still kind of relate because uploads become more infrequent; channel traffic slows down

this is why i want to make videos that are related to montage parodies, but arent exactly meta montage parodies, like I said before:

im not quitting montage parodies, its basically seen as either you wait for me to upload one video a month or i upload one video a month with a bunch of you know, funny gameplay stuff in between. A great example of this would be counter strike global offensive

but at the end of the day, its all down to you guys, you guys are my subscribers and id love to hear your feed back on what youd like me to do next,

leave a comment below: your thoughts and ideas. Im gonna try to respond to as many comments as I can to this video. I would love to

hear your feedback on what kind of videos youd want to see, any future ideas for the channel. I feel that because your subscribed

to an extent, you're inclined to, you know, share your thoughts and ideas, and have a say on what i should do next, and its really

appeciated guys. and lastly i want to thank you guys, thank you guys for helping this channel grow so quickly, in such a short amount of time

I mean I started doing videos like these just over a year ago and i would have never expected my channel to grow so quickly in such a short amount of time

just from montage parodies its amazing, you know ive been reading the comments and some of them have just been genuinly amazing

ive been told people have depression and they find these videos you know therapeutic and have enjoyed them, and lifted their spirits

and stuff and its just amazing how my videos can do that to people and that really motivates me to do more of these videos, and just thank you all so much

for giving me this opportunity, it really-it really means a lot guys you have no idea, and lastly i want to give a shout out

to all the people who helped make this video whether thats voice overs, animations, stuff like that. firstly we got Harvey Rothman

he designed my youtube profile picture, and has also designed a what the fast intro for my channel, and its just amazing. i love his animation style he is just a really nice guy to talk to, be sure to subscribe to his channel, hes got an upcoming animation

for five nights at freddys ""foxy gets hooked"", he does music production, hes all around a really good guy, next we got Hitlerspimp

hes just so talent with SFM, he designed the intro for me, its unbelivable how talented he his, be sure to check out his videos, hes just

amazing. and lastly check out creamforce for his sexy voice over he did in the video honestly he does a lot of montage parody esc videos, definintely check him out

his videos are just amazing and he just has a great personality all around. and thats it guys thats all i wanted to explain, thank you all for sitting through this video

and taking all the information in, dont forget to comment down below your thoughts and feelings, id love to hear your feelings on where to take this channel montage parodies are still coming, ive got at least 2 videos in the works right now and will be up very soon. thank you all again for a quarter of a million subscribers im just still amazed that we reached this number in just a short amount of time, thanks guys.

thıs are explaınıng CS:GO.",FALSE
6608,"I've determined that Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is from another dimension. It's a game that doesn't need to exist. PC gamers (thousands of them, according to SteamGraph ) are perfectly served by Counter-Strike: Source and CS 1.6 , content with the decade-something of tuning and attention those games have received.

But here's GO: full of doppelganger Desert Eagles and de_dust déjà vu, quantum-leaping from some parallel timeline whose game industry briefly intersected with ours. Playing it is like running into a college crush at the supermarket. You immediately notice differences. Oh, you're married? Your hair looks different. But that experience of reconnecting is pleasant—they're mostly still the person you admired during geology.

In other words, GO's familiarity helps and hurts. Minor deviations from the CS you might've known or loved are easy to identify. The MP5 is now the MP7, but it lacks the same clicky report and underdoggy “this is all I can afford, please don't kill me” personality. The TMP is replaced by the MP9. Ragdoll physics don't persist after death, curiously. You can't attach a suppressor to the M4 for some reason.

I'm not particularly bothered by this stuff; I don't need the MP5 reproduced precisely as it existed in 2004 or 2000 to live a fulfilling life. What does bug me are some small but significant changes to firing feedback. When you shoot someone in GO, they don't wince. There's a sneeze of blood, and audio that conveys that you're hitting them if you're within a certain range. But they don't do this , and I don't understand the decision to omit a flinch animation on character models.

Especially at long range, it takes a little more effort and squinting than it should to tell if I'm hitting someone or not. And counterintuitively, bullet tracers, new in this version of CS, are an unreliable source of feedback. They seem to trail the path of your actual bullet by a few microseconds. With rifles and SMGs, my eyes would wander away from my enemy and crosshairs--what I should be watching--and try to interpret where my bullets were falling based on the slightly-delayed, streaky particle effects. The small upside to tracers is that they mitigate camping a bit.",FALSE

Its so fucking annoying. The thing is, csgo has a really loyal fanbase. Literally nothing significant has been done to fix matchmaking since the games release and it still manages to hold on to so many fucking players. Its insane. Just imagine what would happen if they fixed matchmaking. This game can be bigger than fucking fortnite I swear just fix your fucking shit.

Also what the fuck is matchmaking, I queued with 2 mge friends (im mge aswell) and we went against 2 lems, 2 supremes, and 1 global. This has happened way too much like wtf.

Review:
Since the game went F2P it now impossible to play. 90% of players use cheats. In every MM since F2P there has been between 2-5 cheaters. Wouldn't be surpised if more have cheats installed but never toggle on when they see there are so many other cheates in the same match. Last match I played there were 4 cheaters in the opposite team. That's 4 out of 5... Cheaters don't even care to try to hide the cheats anymore. Just use free cheats which spams chat with cheat ads etc. Hell why bother, just get a new acc in 5 mins if they get banned.
Another sad part is that the community is as toxic as always, so even if u don't cheat or have cheaters on your team you often get kicked by your own team for no reason at all. Out of my last 5 matches I've been kicked at the middle or end of the  match on 3 of them. One for no reason at all, one.. I'm not sure but I think it was because they think I didn't score enough kills vs 3 cheaters on the other team. They where all posting in chat about it etc, no doubt there. The last one I actually got kicked for almost killing the entire enemy team even though 4 of them cheated. After 4 kills, with 1 enemy left my team kicked me because they didn't want me to win. They laughed uncontrollably as I was voted off for no reason.

The time spent in this game if you are an adult and have an hour of spare time in the evenening to play a match to relax and get your mind off work or such is just mindblowingly wasted.
The experience for new players must be the worst ever. F2P will be a total killer for the game.

I'm starting to think that this is an intended way for Valve to get people annoyed of CS:GO and longing for a change, so they can finally release a new CS. There have been discussions about this before. The CS:GO game engine is getting old, but Valve is also stuck with it since people have invested money in skins etc. How will they be able to launch a new CS? WarOwl for instance has released Youtube clips on this topic.
Maybe this might be a way. Make it F2P so it gets flooded with cheaters, the popularity will plummet and this will create an interest for a fresh start with a new game.

Sad way to go about it though. On top of this you can add the usual issues of bad hit registration (more roll the dice than skill based gaming many times), often a laggy experience (get killed by someone warping around like a wizard, lagging so hard that you can't hit them - but they can hit you since you don't lag.. skill based...). And with the new GUI they also removed the option to report laggy servers, so Valve don't care about that anymore apparantly.

At this point this game is a complete waste of time and if you've EVER considered trying out CS - please don't do it now. There has never been a worse time to try this game and you will not even get near the enjoyment or thrill that makes people like the game, get interested and come back to play more.

I´ve been playing Cs:Go quiet a long time. I had to buy it twice. Because someone stole my Account and steam support did nothing about it. But that is another story. Today I am here to talk about the new Cs:Go Update which made it Free to play and PUBG. I do not mind the new mod, I played it and it is great. But the fact that Cs:Go is free to play made me digsuted. I have few reasons: I bought it and all I get is some dumb badget. We could at least get some kind of special skin, some bonuses or anything else. But you gave us a Badge, the most ""Useful"" thing we all so care about. 
Another reason is that few days ago I told my friend to buy it, so we can play together. Now he is angry at me because it is now free! I think it is just stupid. Basically we threw our money out of the window. And we are not going to get it back.
The new update messed up the whole game. I think more than hundred people are going to cheat. Why? Simple, Got a ban? Create a new Account and download it again. Tons of fun right?

Have a nice day.

Adding the battle royale game mode was a big risk and although it isn't too bad, still was uncessary for players.

This promotes more hackers, smurfs, and cheaters to join the community with no additional cost.

I tried to play in the new non-prime MM. Its just shit. Just played a game where there was 6 cheaters, and of course none of them will get banned, because VAC is completely useless.
Non-prime MM is now a free way for cheats makers and cheaters to test if they will get VAC or not, and they can do it as much as they want, because the game is free.

Your Anti-cheat is complete shit, so to fix that you just make the game free so even more cheaters can join? GG.
And don't tell me that it will only affect non-prime. Because every non-prime account before update have been upgraded to prime, and cheaters in non-prime who see that they don't get VAC will eventually upgrade to prime.

I played most of them, was forced by peer pressure to buy CS:GO pretty much in August 2012 when it came out. Played over 1000 hours (which is compared to others peanuts at best) in this time. 
I mostly enjoyed the game.

However, with the newest stragetic choice of Valve to make it Free to Play and let themselves being paid AGAIN to be within the circle with less cheaters, they got into a storm of brown excrements.
I payed for the game, now I am nothing anymore and am expected to pay again (at least for the same experience).

While games go from ""paid"" to ""F2P"" sometimes, they usually offer some bonus to those, who paid. This appears to be not the case here.
Considering that Valve makes tons of money and I feel entitled to get at least something out of the money I paid back then, I cannot reommend this game (anymore).

6836,"Я считаю что CSGO это самая отвратительная популярная игра в 21 веке. Такое говно терпеть уже просто нельзя. И поэтому сейчас я вам расскажу почему я так считаю.

Я не буду оценивать графику, я слишком давно играю в игры и я понимаю что это не так важно.

Начнём с того что я хочу задать вопрос - ПОЧЕМУ ВЫ ВООБЩЕ ИГРАЕТЕ В ЭТУ ИГРУ? напишите мне в комментарии под обзором, я не понимаю. Найдётся ли несколько плюсов? Эта игра тоже самое что и Counter-Strike 1.6 только в новой оболочке, а некоторые заверяют что даже хуже. Эта игра не представляет из себя НИЧЕГО интересного. Почему игра 2011 года лучше чем игра 1999? Ведь по сути, ничего нового придумано не было. Разработчики просто натянули новые текстурки на старые карты, никакой новый механики не было добавлено всё осталось таким же примитивным. В игре нет разнообразия. Сейчас люди играют на тех же картах что и во времена нулевых. Даст, нюк, мираж, инферно и т.д. Некоторые идиоты которые увидели что я наиграл в доту 2 мне пишут следующие: НО ВЕДЬ В ДОТЕ 2 ТОЖЕ ОДНА КАРТА И НИКТО НЕ ЖАЛУЕТСЯ!!!! ЧЕ ТЫ ТУТ ВЫСИРАЕШЬ!!!!!!!. В доте разные герои, предметы с кучей связок - вот что делает игру разнообразной. Да, не лучшее коммьюнити, но и о нём речи не шло, речь шла о механиках, тем временем КСГО предлагает одну механику - виды оружия и знаете, в игре используется ПОЛОВИНА всего арсенала, если не меньше.
AWP, AK-47, P90, M4A4(M4A1-S), GLOCK, USP-S, FIVE-SEVEN, TEC-9 И ВСЁ. Почему я не могу взять дробовик или миниган из-за того что это якобы плохое оружие? Почему разработчики не доработают оружие так, чтобы игроки могли себя чувствовать полезными не только на КАЛАШЕ И МКЕ. Разрабы этого не делают и это делает игру ужасной и колхозной. А знаете почему? Потому-что всех ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ кто играет в CSGO всё и так устраивает. Ведь эта игра очень простая для понимания и даже самый примитивный млекопитающий сможет в неё играть. ЧТО МОЖЕТ БЫТЬ ПРОЩЕ.. ОТРЯД СПЕЦНАЗА И ТЕРРОРИСТЫ. Никакого лора, синглплеера. Иногда мне кажется что у игроков в КС только два IQ - А и Б. И они постоянно меняются то а, то б и смысл жизни - бомба. ЭТО настолько древняя механика, которая всем должна была надоесть.. Почему бы не поиграть в Overwatch (мертвая игра) или в Rainbow Six Siege, ведь сейчас эти шутеры НАМНОГО лучше чем ЭТО дерьмо. Да, они стоят дороже, но они объективно лучше. Если вы играете во что угодно, но чтобы было по дешевле-бесплатно, то вы не уважаете себя. Но знаете, самое страшное-странное в КСГО это читеры. И их очень много. С переходом игры на F2P платформу читеров развелось очень много. Кто-то скажет - прайм решит всё, но его не так сложно получить. 21 левел и привязать телефон к стим аккаунту. Да это долго, но не сложно. Valve как бы пытаются с ними бороться, античит VAC. Делают патруль в котором учавствуют игроки, и часто банят невинных игроков, но в итоге читеров меньше не становится, а остальные продолжают усердно терпеть. И этого я ВООБЩЕ не понимаю. Зачем играть в плохую игру так и ещё с читерами, с которыми нормално не борются. У меня есть две теории - Первая - CSGO это наркотик от Valve который притягивает всех и люди не могут от него оторваться. Второе - игроки в CSGO просто тупые. Они говорят про проблемы игры, но продолжают играть и ныть. И мы не говорим о Коммьюнити, рандомной стрельбе, бустерах. Все эти проблемы возникают как только вы ИЗНАЧАЛЬНО начинали играть в плохую игру. Мне больно смотреть на то как игроки ХОТЬ КАК-ТО пытаются разнообразить этот унылый геймплей различными Сёрф картами, картами зомби и ДАЖЕ картами на прохождение. Это ПИПЕЦ какой рак. Я понимаю что игру могла бы спасти регулярная система обновлений и вроде она присутствует, но даже здесь всё очень херово. Весь список ГЛОБАЛЬНЫХ обновлений очень мал за 11 лет. И то запомнился больше всех РЕВОЛЬВЕР который добавили наверное стажёры Valve. Потом его конечно изменили. Как и всё изменяется в этой игре. Разрабы всеми силами пытаются скрыть своё говно и выпускают обновления где изменяют дизайн карт созданных во времена Counter-Strike 1.6.. Есть новые карты, но.. НА НИХ НИКТО НЕ ИГРАЮТ. А, может вы играете ради КИБЕРСПОРТА. Вы оправдываете своё задротство тем что хотите играть в профессиональных командах? Извините, но я думаю все кто сейчас играют в ксго (не проф. игроки) не добьются НИ-ЧЕ-ГО. Максимум они будут бегать в камуфляже с пушкой в руках, только в реальной жизни. И если вы ещё питаете какие-то надежды, глубоко вздохните и.. Сдайтесь. Всё что связывает игроков CSGO и киберспорт это то что они делают СТАВКИ на матчи. Отслеживают турниры со скучным геймплеем только ради того чтобы выйграть ставочку и понятное дело они разбираются в том, что происходит. Знают что такое эко, какие раскидки бывают, знают своих любимые ПРО игроков и хотят стать такими же как они и продолжают есть говно и тратить своё время на этот высер под названием CSGO. Вы только представьте, на твиче CSGO смотрят более Двухста ТЫСЯЧ человек ежедневно. Выходит так - что вы играете в кс, чтобы смотреть киберспортивные матчи по этой игре и делать ставки, чтобы получить СКИНЧИК? ВЫ ЧТО СОВСЕМ ТУПЫЕ? ВЫ ЧТО.. СОВСЕМ.. ТУПЫЕ? ВЫ.. ЧТО? СОВСЕМ.. ТУПЫЕ?

Окей, самое ужасное и странное за что эта игра популярна это Скины. Скины на оружие, тоесть серьёзно, скины на оружие, абсолютно безвкусные разноцветные облики на оружие за которые дети и взрослые готовы отдать кучу бабла. А ну да, вы же не платите, вы их ВЫБИВАЕТЕ в кейсах. Большая разница, конечно. Потратить 10к рублей чтобы купить скинчик на нож или купить 100 кейсов и потратить 2к-3к (не знаю) для того, чтобы не выбить.. И таких предметов в игре СОТНИ, но они не представляют в себе ничего кроме не очень красивых текстурок. Всё что есть это ножик за 20к рублей который даже не настоящий, им нельзя даже в анале почесать, всё что можно делать это крутить его в руках и думать что ты не дегенерат, тратя 20к рублей на внутри игровой предмет, который, зачастую НЕ красивый. Я вообще не понимаю почему люди тратят деньги на внутри игровые предметы в CSGO если можно купить нормальные игры, а не играть в это не понятно что. Самое плохое что есть это сайты рулетки которые рекламируют ютуберы, чтобы вы вливали туда денег.

Сейчас я расскажу, а может даже кому-то сломаю жизнь, КАК ВАС РАЗВОДЯТ.

Зародилась азартная игра внутри плохой игры и Valve конечно, с этим не борются. Потому-что доходы от этого помешательства на скинах огромен. Они знают одно правило - Если в игре можно хоть не много, но заработать реальные деньги на продаже предметов, то люди будут играть, а точнее проверять свою удачу. Знакомо, не так-ли?

Потому-что это правило самого КАЗИНО. Человек входит в азарт и каждый раз играет всё крупнее и крупнее. Но знаете что отличает КСГО и Казино? Азартные игры запрещеные людям младше 18 лет. Потому-что детей нельзя пускать к азартным играм. Но игровые кейсы и сотни сайтов, которые заверяют что вы можете выбить ДРАГОН ЛОР, КРУТЫЕ НОЖИ, они доступны КАЖДОМУ ребёнку, который играет в CSGO. Это очень прибыльное дело. Потому-что дети часто заливают в такие сайты свои карманные деньги и в случае проигрыша могут залить только ЕЩЁ больше. Кто-то скажет: ""ДА ВСЕ ЭТО И ТАК ДАВНО ЗНАЮТ ТОЛЬКО ЛОХИ ВЕДУТСЯ НА ЭТО!"", но тогда почему количество таких сайтов и прибыль таких сайтов не уменьшается, а наоборот увеличиваются? Это уже не просто донат на крылышки в какой-то ММО РПГ, это целая золотая жила, построенная на азартных играх. И поддерживает её реклама, а в большей части ЮТУБЕРЫ, которые показывают такие сайты, ну как показывают, они выпускают видео где ловят джекпот. Выигрывают очень дорогую вещь за 15 а того и больше тысяч рублей и большинство верит что это правда и отправляется играть в казин-, тоесть на этих сайтах открывать кейсы. А вы не думали что этот выйгрыш вашего любимого ютубера является ФЕЙКОМ? Тоесть проплаченным владельцом сайта. Эти лицемерные мудаки продолжают выдавливать из себя эмоции счасться и крики, за ранее зная что им выпадет. Я очень жалею о потраченном времени в этой игре и хочу, чтобы никто не делал также.",FALSE

There is just something special about this game. Is like you constantly get more addicted.

CSGO still has a lot of potentials and it's the best e-sport game ever.

There are just too many problems with this game, some can’t even be fixed.

-Russias
Do they really think that the main world language is Russian?
It's like a lot of them need to have some kind of IQ test before joining the game.

-Toxic ones
Well, those actually speak English but it is mostly stuff that you don't wanna hear in-game.
Something like SHITY POP CONCERT. Or just random yelling at the mic.

-No mic
Uf, Those are great ones. They think that CSGO is just a PvP game. They are probably playing without any sounds either.
On the other side, there are those that just ignore you. They have a mic but decide to troll others. 

Hell is filled with the same people.

-Hackers
Hahahahahaha. Imagine being so bad that you even have to think about hacking.
They are just trying to destroy the game. But I guess that happens when VALVE decides to give CSGO for free. Now they don't even need to spend money on accounts.

It's FREE.

Cases, ranks, servers ...

Recently, I've wanted to play some games with my mates because I hadn't played for so long. Now, what I get is framedrops, decreased fps, just because of so many updates that wasn't necesary. The worst thing is that players with annoying or unfriendly behaviour are not banned, or maybe suspended. Now, at 1:52 A.M. all I can say is that I won't play this game again. From a very good opinion it has changed to the worst one. In my last games I always had annoying enemies, I've played like 9-10 games, in all of them were bad teamates or toxic enemies. And the worst part about Valve, the worst part CS:GO is that those players are never banned. Last thing that I could say is that I won't recomend this game to anyone ever.

This game is the epidemy of ""install the game"" and go to ""third party matchmaking"" where ESEA had farmed bitcoin off of their users and FACEIT basically dominating the casual playerbase. Official MM has half the tickrate, 0% of the anticheat that third party MM offers and overall a horrible experience. Being from NA, but far enough away from the ""48"" west servers are the only option for me to play. I can't possibly enjoy faceit when the lowest ping I get to them is about 120ms to Denver and ESEA is a bit sketch. Not to mention there are bugs that have been in the game for OVER 2 years that havent been fixed. I can't possibly enjoy this game until valve get their priorities straight.

Valve has done an amazing job creating and developing the game, but at the same time they p1$$ed on all their work. 

I believe it's all business, and it's all for money.
Many players are banned because they cheat and are forced to buy the game again.
And people who don't cheat need to switch the matchmaking to Faceit , Esea , etc.
VAC is extremely weak. Anybody can cheat!.

I have reported cheaters on support.steampowered.com and no one replied.

I bookmarked the steamid of the suspect players to see when they get Overwatch or VAC but aren't banned because they play 1 game a day so they won't get into the overwatch session and they can't get banned even when they play with ragebot. 
Reports on the profiles and tickets are useless. 

I am now “training” against cheaters because I have no choice. I win/lose being able to maintain myself in Global Elite .
I don’t think there’s a match without me facing at least one cheater.

I came to the conclusion that Faceit has a really good Anti-Cheat , but it's frustrating that Valve refused to secure the game better against cheaters.
I feel like I play on Faceit for nothing. I can abandon any match because I don’t care, I have nothing to lose, nothing motivates me.

I really want Valve to secure the game and to eliminate the cheaters. It would be a much better game.
CS:GO could be the best game in the world if they would think about the community and if this wouldn't be only about money and people buying the game. I understand every game has cheaters, but if you really have the resources to stop them, why not? They created this game and instead of being proud of it, they just don't care, they just care about the money. Soon there's going to be matches like cheaters vs cheaters .",FALSE

The idea of case openings and gun skins, as well as the possibility of getting an ultra rare knife was part of my interest in the game, however, the other portion came from watching well known and respected youtubers, such as the WarOwl. I genuinely wanted to try the game and see if I could get good at it. However, upon my first real game, I encountered, within just a few rounds, 3 separate hackers, each using a different type of hack. One was wallhacking and tracking us across the map so he could kill us all, another had flipped a lag switch so that we wouldn't be able to see them coming or react, in the case that we were able to see them, and the third was using aim hacks to lock onto our heads and instantly kill us.

And people say you need skill to play this game correctly. which dumbfounds me that people would say that this game needs you to TRY. its a game. you dont need to be good at it. now games like WT, WoT, Crysis (1) multiplayer, near any RTS or TBS game; would require skill. learning the bullet spray pattern of your M4 isnt skill. its memorization. now. if you where put into a situation where things are dynamic, and youre forced to adapt to a situation, and use what you learned befor to change an outcome, but the outcome was also countered, giving you the need to think what to do. these situations appear all the time in the previous listed games. So far, CSGO is just spray and prey. 

People like to take this game too seriously. well. people can say that about any game. but CSGO is in such a way, that you can start getting TKd by team members the start of every round in official servers till they are kicked, just because you planted the bomb, or shot a guy around a corner he was shooting at. or some other stupid reason. there isnt many of them. you dont do much in this game in general. smoke, flash, run, shoot. repeat. :/

And if you can't speak russian, then you will probably get kicked at first 3 rounds, so I recommend playing this trash game with friends.
The most annoying thing in this game is that you can't download any mods to it, but of course you can cheat, use spinbot, aimbot, wh, auto bhop, and you won't get banned. This game literally sucks. VALVE don't even care about this game. They are like ""LeTs AdD SoMe NeW fU.C.k.InG sKiNs AnD cAsEs!!11"" THEY ARE DOING EVERYTHING TO MAKE THIS GAME DEAD.

1. Download cheats
2. Speak russian
3. Be toxic asf

7122,"I have roughly 1700 hours at the time of this review. I have acquired quite a bit of knowledge on the game, and am righting this review for those looking to buy it. For reference, im currently Master Guardian 2 in matchmaking and C+ on ESEA . This game has a lot of great features, but those are quickly shadowed by the slaughter that is everything else in the game. The hitboxes, seemingly not there, prove to not be in any way accurate. You can find many videos on youtube showing in slow motion a shot from an AWP , a normally 1 shot sniper, being shot at another player, and the bullet seems to go THROUGH the player, even leaving a bullet hole decal on the wall behind. Thats one of the big issues that is still overlooked by valve. The next problem, being de-sync. This happens when the client and the server aren't ""on the same page"" so to speak. This makes it look to the client that they have done something that they haven't done, i.e shooting a player and see blood splatter all over the walls, and when they get killed after seemingly unloading 30 rounds into the opponent, only one shot has registered. Those are two of the biggest game breaking bugs. Now for the toxicity of the community, matchmaking, and cheaters. Now i will say, valve is taking a step in the right direction with overwatch (system allowing players to view suspects and determine if they are cheating or not) but it is not without flaws. My friend recently got falsely banned because he hit a couple bunny hops in a game and got a headshot. I personally believe the minimum to overwatch should be 1000 hours and at least MG1 rank. this would allow for less false accusations. Also, VACNET, a self learning anti cheat, is also a plus. But there are still so many players that are cheating that for this game to ever be even close to clean, it would take a lot. The matchmaking is one of the most dangerous places on the planet. Between being placed with little kids, toxic people that don't speak the same language as the rest of the team, cheaters , and smurfs, its a rough experience. Personally, i would recommend playing ESEA , a payed service that allows for a slightly more skillful, cheat free, clean experience. Of course, theres always the people that ruin everything, but when you pay to play something your less likely to throw your money away by cheating , throwing, etc. This game has much more of a focus on having skins and buying in game content to make up for Gabens needs, and i personally believe that CS:GO is looking at the light at the end of the tunnel. The pro scene will soon die, the player count is constantly decreasing, and there are just more and more cheaters. I love this game, and will continue to play it.

The game is pretty hard so practice is an absolute MUST to progress further. If you are someone who doesn't like playing ranked/competitive I would recommend giving it a try.

I bought the game some years ago, and it pisses me off that everyone who bought the game before December 7. gets Prime Status. This means more hackers and douchebags will have gained Prime status now, previously you had to link a phone number to your account.

This basically means Valve farmed a load of phone numbers to grant users Prime status, now users can simply buy the game and get Prime status. When the game gets on sale, this will result in a bunch of hackers gaining access to the game cheaply and will begin hacking again.

Valve intended to make a dildo for single-person use, but ended up with a double ended dildo fucking themselves senseless in both holes. Please get your shit together Valve.

Don't get me wrong, I like the game, but Valve are seriously trying to make people hate it. Just look at the graph of reviews from December when the game became F2P.

[b]My recommendation[/b], don't buy the game, grab the free version. Valve makes use of Trust Factor as well as Prime status (or at least they did, I hope they still do).
If you have a good Trust Factor (got many games, have played for loads of hours etc.) there is a good chance that you won't get matched with new accounts who purchased the game just to hack.
Before CS:GO became F2P I personally preferred the Trust Factor matchmaking over Prime. Now I dont even know.

The ranking system is broken in my opinion it always seems it feel like you will win 4 or 5 games in a row and on the game you think it is your rank up game you have someone trolling in your team or they are AFK. The servers don't make such sense as in my opinion matchmaking would be a lot better if they kept the matchmaking to countries rather than continents as the language barriers can cause massive issues in trying to build a team from people you have met for the first time. For someone who wanted to put in the hours to become a better playing and see myself improve I was let down by the matchmaking system. It's proven that if you don't have a team you play with already you are just hoping and begging you get matched with good players who can speak your language and aren't toxic. 

I will be honest though, the game will always have a hold on me because when it is good its amazing but when things go bad you really want to uninstall the game and never touch it again.

7240,"This game used to be fine, but somewhere along the way with all the updates they've been doing, they've slowly turned this game into THE biggest embarrassment to bear the name of CS. Counter-strike: Global Offensive? More like Counter-Strike: Globally Offensive. 

They've taken away the ability to adjust your cl_cmdrate and cl_updaterate as it is now a fixed/set number. 
Trying to change your rate doesn't help anymore either. 
Trying to use the console, sometimes it will freeze up and you cannot type anymore nor can you even highlight what you've typed, so you have to close it, then shift+control arrow key to highlight what you have, and start over again. 
What you see on the recording or demo or playback is NOT what you see in real life. (I.E. If you were to record your screen with a camera, and then play it back side by side with a demo of the game you had just played, they would NOT be identical.
My system is old, so it can't process things like skins very well anymore, and so sometimes when I hit the buy menu (which is a crappy radial menu now) and I mouse over some of my weapons, the skin takes about a half second to register that it is on the gun. So you see the default skin first, and then it applies my actual skin that I have selected. 
They made the Sig550 and AUG have a ring around it and it's CoD-esque.
They added CoD-esque ranks to the game that don't even matter. Is this CS or is this Call of Duty?
All the guns sound the same now, and most of them don't sound a single thing like they used to, nor do they even mimmic their actual real life sound. 
They made the p250 inaccurate.
They made the UMP useless.
They made it to where when you're using an AWP, its faster to CROUCH around a corner than to run... ... ... smh...
They made the community disappear by making community servers some backwater app that you have to surf through, or know someone to get into/find a server. 
They made Casual a first to 8 rounds game with free armor and defuse kits for every round (basically eliminating the META for the game and making the M4 never get a one shot headshot, and the pistol round is basically a click-fest). On top of that, when you click Casual, it doesn't take you to a community server where you make friends, have laughs, and come back the next night over and over again. It puts you in a RANDOM generated server and doesn't put it in your recent list.
The registration is terrible. I would put it to you that the 64 tick servers that they have for match making are some of the worst I've played on. 
Most of the other modes are about the same as the other with the exception of Match Making. Which, in nearly every 5v5, someone rage quits, cheats, curses you out, or team kills you. Sure, you can vote to kick the toxic players, but then if you do, you're stuck with a bot that will not only NOT listen to you more than half the time, he will be NO help economically. So he rushes with an awp to A site WITH THE BOMB ON HIS BACK as you're frantically trying to hit ""FALL BACK"" with the z, x, and c buttons, which they changed the orders around now and he's saying in a crappy accent, ""Noh! I will plant zeh bomba at A!""

This game is like an attack on everyone who plays CS. I can see why they named it what they did. The devs that they have ""fixing"" the game keep making things worse with each update, and you have to have a fast system to play this properly, or someone will literally... I MEAN LITERALLY appear on your screen before you've seen them, kill you, and you fire back, then see blood as you hit them, and then it says you didn't hit them at all. This happens on a DAILY basis. I used to 30-40 bomb or at least second frag every game, and now, with this new and improved version of a micro-transaction squeaker fest of a game, I'm lucky to get a server that lets me hit my targets. My last game... I GOT 5 kills... the entire game. I know I'm getting old, but when I've been playing CS since 1.4, and I come to this and get just ""STEAM-ROLLED""... it's got to be something more than just me having a bad day. I even tested myself by going onto Battlefield 4 and I stole stop frag with a 32-0 score. Yes, CS takes more skill, but it was validation that I'm not the problem.

I'm in the process of building a new system because my current one is getting very old, but there shouldn't be that much of a gap between two years ago, and now. It's like the developers have just been adding code, on top of code, on top of code, and the game is getting sluggish. I sincerely feel attacked that Gaben and his people have focused on making DoTA 2 an AMAZING game. I MEAN that. It's a great looking and very playable game, (here comes the but) but they've left CS:GO, which btw and in my opinion, saved Valve after they bought it from its makers. It was their saving grace and now they're throwing it to the wolves. I've played this game almost my whole life, and its WHAT I DO. This is my game.... and this version, CS: Globally Offensive, seems like it's killing me from the inside out. It's like losing a loved one.

7258,"

Has been in my collection for years without getting much playtime. Last week i dusted it off and gave it a try - and I am a bit on the fence.

TL;DR: Game is nice, but Valve exploits kids into throwing money at them in a most abominable way.

Pro:
* The gameplay itself is fun and reminds me of the good ole Tactical Ops times, but with todays graphics. 
* All the money stuff is pure cosmetics, no pay-2-win.

Con:
* I do not understand the server-assignment logic. Yes, ping is important - but also is being able to communicate with your teammates. I cherish the one time in a week I had a scotsman on the team who I could talk to...
* The game is trying to entice players into paying for stuff at every opportunity and I guess a lot of people sink a lot of money on skins, gambling and microtransactions (example: you get chests as random drop but have to buy a key to actually see what is in the chest).
This game is luring players into money sinks, knowing that it is to a large part insecure kids falling prey to this business tactic.

7292,"Counter Strike: Global Offensive (in short CS:GO) is a game, which is loved and hated at the same time. Is so good, or so bad?

CS:GO is another game from Counter Strike series with upgraded graphics and mechanisms. In this game, you need to fight other players with variety of weapons in different gamemodes, in some you are ranked. It's easy to learn, but very hard to master.

CS is not an expensive game compared to its quality. Maybe it's not the prettiest, but it has not many bugs and that's why it's so popular in e-sports.

But the worst aspect of CS:GO is its community. Many angry kids, people who can't say a word in english and expect everyone to speak in their language, and, of course, idiots in your team, cheaters and smurfs (players who play on another account with lower rank) in enemy team. Making CS:GO a free game increased the amount of cheaters (and there was really many of them even before that). In 3 matches out of 4, in enemy team there is a player who has more kills than whole of your team combined, maybe shoots through walls and hits every shot.

There are also skins, which are just a way to waste money. You can get skins to your weapons from crates, and although crates are really cheap, keys to them are not. There is a really low chance you will get a skin worth more than the key.

Summary: CS:GO when looking purely at its gameplay, is a good game. But the community destroys it. I don't recommend it, you need to have infinite patience.

I have many hours on this game, and when it first came out, like every game, it was decent.

(unless you're a 5 man, if you are, you're doing it right) - or

Playing this game now, no longer brings me joy. It frustrates me that there are people out there that low, that take more pride in ruining someone elses time on the game, then playing it with the intention in which it was created to be played.

If I was to have written this review 3 years ago, I've had 10/10 recommended it without hesitation, but it appears the Call Of Duty lot have found their way onto CSGO, and brought them their the same, kiddy, arrogant attitudes. 

So LilNutter, how about reporting them for griefing?"" - I love when I'm also asked this question, because I am yet to see, in 1,500 hours, someone actually get finished for griefing. The option, just like the game, is dead.

I love team-based games, I love how the team needs to communicate to do well, and it isn't even about winning; if you lose, but you and your team had a strong game - that's as much of a win as getting the 16 rounds. But now, you'll be lucky to even get 5 with the amount of childish, moronic people that play competitive. 

Also, don't be fooled by Prime Matchmaking, it does sweet fuck all regarding making it playable. 

Sorry if this isn't what you wanted to hear about this game, but it's about as playable as the likelihood of Steven Hawkings beating retired Olympian Usain Bolt in a 100m sprint.

7324,"In short: This game is pretty f***ing bad

My full opinion:

This game has by far the worst community and suuports ever. VAC is supposed to ban users who were detected using cheats in-game from playing the game permanently. However, Valve did nothing with it and cheaters are literally flooding this game. It was once a great game but the developer had forgotten what this game is supposed to be and turned into a bunch of money wh***. The recent updats are nothing but cosmetic items. No bugs fixing, no ban waves. We even had a year that no operations were released. 

OH! I forgot to mention that the develpoer deletes any topics complaining any types of bans on the forum and users could be banned from it for posting complains about the cheaters in the game, such a mature group of adult

Now, let's talk about the game itself.  The game is also awfully repetitive, giving players the worst gaming experience in years. However, there are still tons of problems left unfixed.

One of the most important will be the hitbox. We all know how bad the Rainbow Six Siege hit-reg was, 1 shot will not be counted a hit in 100 shots, that is pretty terrible already as players may miss the opportunity for engagements. However, the R6S hit-reg apocolypse was no match to the 
disastrous hit-reg in this game, I did not do any testing for it but I am confident to say only 85% of the shots were registered per 100 shots.

The servers are also terrible for gameplay as it only has 64 ticks servers unless you find third party servers such as CEVO.",FALSE

So i hereby say that unless you're willing to waste your complete life ranking up and becomming the laziest and the best player, don't buy this game.

7326,fix your game. hackers everywhere.,FALSE

What remains to say to the game still a lot was said ....
I write now my own comment and no Russian speaking I still cannot.
Would you like to get to know or meet Russians?
You like it to play a multiplayer 5 vs. 5 virtually to play alone.
You'll love it in a communication/ teamplay- game to speak to oneself,
because no one else does.
It's fun when everyone does what he wants,
all run in different directions without meaning and purpose.
You're also of the opinion that expensive pro-gamer headsets are unnecessary.
Who needs headphones or what to make announcements.
You're tired of being scolded by the French in Call of Duty.
You like to put more money in a game than necessary.
You like it when you buy expensive weapons skins which are later less worth.
You love to play a game for all eternity, But still not reach a new level as in other games.
You like to be scolded as a noob because you have 2 kills less than the one who insults you.
If you play a different weapon than all the others you are badly made.
Your love for Eastern countries increases thereby you will harder.
If you play alone then you meet strangers who can not speak your language or English.
You are kicked out of the game when your team players do not like you.
Your teammates are not always better than you, with the time you start Votekick like a Russian.
Unnecessary games where you do not meet trollers / hackers does not interest you.
So do not waste time with FaceIT and other things ..
You do not like beginner-friendly games because you are the PRO-Gamer.
The game is aimed at competition with teamplay, announcements and hearing
That is why it is so popular because it requires players, but not the pc.
Since I play the game, I always look exactly who is adding me.
In doubt, take no one suspect in your friendlist most want partial only your skins.
""I am Dimitri I send to you friendship request you accept!
And now lie down quietly on the floor, click on LINK and give me your CS: GO Skins.
Many thanks for your cooperation ""

You do not like long instructions and do not know what to do now.
Then it's time to dive into the nicest gaming community there is.
Did I say you can buy it? I said you have to buy it!

CS: GO is like a greedy woman, but you love her forever until the end of time.
The feeling of hate and love connects and you can not change anything.
It's like roulette quite fun unless you play the Russian.

Was bleibt zu dem Spiel noch zu sagen viel wurde gesagt ....
Ich schreib mal meinen eigenen Kommentar und nein Russisch kann ich noch immer nicht.
Sie möchten gerne Russen kennenlernen?
Es gefällt ihnen ein Multiplayer 5 gegen 5 praktisch alleine zu spielen.
Sie lieben es in einem auf Kommunikation Teamplay Basierenden Spiel
mit sich selbst zu reden, weil es sonst niemand tut.
Es macht ihnen Spaß wenn jeder nur das tut was er will,
alle in verschiedene Richtungen laufen ohne Sinn und Zweck.
Sie sind auch der Meinung das teuere Pro-Gamer Headsets unnötig sind.
Wer braucht denn schon überhaupt Kopfhörer oder wozu Ansagen machen.
Sie sind es leid in Call of Duty bloß von Franzosen beschimpft zu werden..
Es gefällt ihnen mehr Geld in ein Spiel zu stecken als notwendig wäre.
Es gefällt ihnen wenn sie teure Waffenskins kaufen der später weniger wert ist.
Sie lieben es ein Spiel bis in alle Ewigkeit zu spielen,
aber trotzdem kein neues Level zu erreichen wie in anderen Games.
Sie stehen drauf als Noob beschimpft zu werden weil sie 2 Kills weniger haben als er.
Wenn sie eine anderen Waffe spielen als alle anderen werden sie schlechtgemacht
Ihr Liebe zu Östlichen Länder steigt dadurch werden sie härter.
Alleine spielt man mit Fremden die deine Sprache nicht können.
Sie werden aus dem Spiel gekickt wenn ihre Teammitspieler sie nicht mögen.
Ihre Teammates sind nicht immer besser als sie,
mit der Zeit startet man auch Votekick wie ein Russe.
Unnötige Spiele wo man auf Anständige nicht Troller/Hacker trifft interessiert sie nicht.
Deshalb keine Zeit mit FaceIT und anderen Dingen verschwenden….
Sie mögen keine Anfängerfreundliche Spiele den sie sind der PRO-Gamer.
Das Game ist auf Wettkampf ausgerichtet mit Teamplay, Ansagen und Gehör.
Genau darum ist es so beliebt weil es Spieler fordert, den PC aber nicht.
Seit ich spiele schaue ich auch immer genau wer mich addet.
Im Zweifelsfalle niemand Suspekten annehmen, die wollen teilweise nur deine Skins.
„Ich bins Dimitri ich dir schicken Freundschaftsanfrage du annehmen!
Und jetzt ganz ruhig auf den Boden, klick auf LINK und geben mir deine CS: GO Skins...
Viele Dank für Mitarbeit“

Sie mögen keine lange Anleitungen und wissen nicht was Sie nun machen sollen.
Dann wird es Zeit in die nettesten Gaming-Community einzutauchen die es gibt.

Valve's gotta get that money, and what better way than to make virtual skins that everyone cares and drools about? It took Valve a fucking lawsuit to actually do something about underage gambling, Valve doesnt care about this game, as a matter of fact they can care less. Everytime they try to fix something, they mess things up even more. JUST STOP TINKERING WITH THE DAMN GUN SOUNDS! 
Despite all this... I come back to the game. Its too fun to not play. Its a strange fun, the community just knows how to make you laugh, and I have gained some actually decent friends off this game.

Four, The market had so many acvtive curators createing skins for the game.

From the very beginning, I dreamed of the highest rank and practiced hard, but with every game I was very disappointed, very often an inadequate team came across or the booster or cheater will go to the opposing team.
The game has a large number of shortcomings, but I have always treated this game as an e-sports discipline. Everything changed when I found an adequate team with which we raised high ranks.
Also, I was very much attracted by a large number of different skins for weapons and knives, they were unbearable in price for me, until I discovered trading for myself.
My verdict: as a game, it is very ambiguous due to a large number of shortcomings and a terrible community. As an e-sports discipline, the game is difficult, it is very difficult to break through to a high level.

I started playing this game 2 years ago and i have enough hours played to write a review about this game.

When i look back i just regret that i wasted over 1,5k hours in this game.

If you dont want to spend money this is not the game for you.

If you want to get mad,lose money and waste time of your life living a dream you wont fulfill this is exactly the game for you.

Good things about this game:
-Game price(dont get enthusiastic you gonna lose so much money throughout your career that this game will be the most expensive game you ever played)

-Well optimized

Bad things:
-Greedy Developers

This game was good and fun, I really enjoyed it even tho there were some cheaters, the cheaters weren't in every game, so I was good with it. But now my experience is very bad, becouse I ended up with some noobs in competetive wich had 200 hours on the game and every time I hit a flick shot or bunny hop etc. they said i have hacks, we ended up losing becouse my team was throwing every round by blocking me and also killing me, basically griefing, I had one vac moment and a clutch 4v1 in one round my team said that I was hacking and reported me, enemy team also reported me, next game I was against a hacker wich had walls, even tho I killed him few times, becouse his movement and positions were almost same every round so it was like free kill to me when i knew where he could be, he got very mad and reported me every round (I did the same), he just started raging so I had no chance, then my teammate started also rage hacking and I left the game and abandoned it. Next day I was hoping that I will not get any hackers in my game or any griefers wich will greif my game, I was playing with my nonprime friend, we got matched against another nonprime and he was cheating. I abandoned, becouse my game is litterally unplayable and if I want to play, I have to play on my smurf, becouse my trust factor on this account is just in minus. R.I.P.

7682,"This game is toxic. Like holy shit is this game toxic. A majority of your time playing will be spent with insanely toxic people consistantly screaming at you, your team, enemy team and the game it's self. In the game rarely will you be able to play a game of comp without wanting to blow your brains out, due to the toxicity of other players and cheaters. The game is just not fun at all due to the community of the game. 

The gameplay in it's self is insanely boring after a while. All though the game is a online game with theoretically infinite game play the game gets old really quick. So the community combined with the stale gameplay makes the quikplay and comp absolutely pointless after a couple hours. The community co-op maps are infinitely better than the regular game, but the game is not built for co-op and that sucks. But wait, valve has made co-op missions earlier in operation wildfire, but it cost like 7 euros but that doesn't matter as long as the missions are good right? Well they where not. There where 3 good missions and the rest where an absolute shit show. It was so depressing to see how much the csgo team could fuck up. And with the rumored heist mode being in the new operation at best I aspect a watered down version of payday 2. The operation will pay around 7 euros meaning you effectively take your self down by 27 euros meaning you hould in that case just buy payday 2 getting you multiple times more game to play. 

Overall there are very few positives about this game. You will have a grate time for the first 20 hours and after that the game will feel more like a chore to keep up your rank and if you want a change in gameplay you have to wait a year and pay 7 euros for 3 mediocer co-op missions and a whole bunch of shitty singleplayer contracts and a lot annoying at best co-op contracts. In all honesty just buy a real co-op online shooter and you will have a lot more fun than playing this game.",FALSE

A balanced, well designed and addicting game.
In CSGO you can play as either a terrorist, or a counter-terrorist, both having a slightly different, but well thought out arsenals.

Okay, maybe not so much.

CSGO is a good game at it's core, but has issues with some recent features and the community being the single worst thing on the planet.

First, the community: You should not expect to have friendly team mates in the competetive or casual game modes. It is always best to go in with friends or simply not play these two, as the chance of getting a friendly player is as likely as you flipping a coin three times and getting it to land on the same side.
You'll be met with insults, hostile behaviour, and pleas for you to uninstall your game if you're new or bad at the game.
And this will not come from the enemy team, it will be your team who do it.

Now, about the recent features:
CSGO has been recently outfitted with a few ""features"", that people either dislike, hate, or are dissapointed in.
Examples include: Showing the flag of your country without an option to turn it off, removal of core maps from the game, some essential to community servers, and others I forgot about(Stopped playing it).

Would never recommend this game unless you have four other friends who will play it with you or you're never going to play competetive or casual. 2/10",FALSE

-A few dudes keep blaming you that every single loss is because everyone else is a fuck up but not them
-The silver mongoloids rush every round and die instantly but when you're the last one alive you're accused of baiting
-Opting to save a gun to have a chance next game instead of 1v3ing but being insulted for it anyway
-Literally not picking any fight with anyone but they still have the audacity to grief you in game even though you're not talking to them
-Tell a guy to stfu when clutching and he just screams even louder instead of acting normal
-Apparently being the top fragger automatically means you start bragging about having more kills even though I never said a word about it.
-Get vote kicked off the game from 3 toxic dudes and one dude that has 3-15 k/d and never talked the whole game

Now I hit shots which go through people without doing damage... I get matched with kids that just throw the game... I get random crashes... I get downtime due to potato servers... I get hackers in almost every game even though it's ""prime""... I end up deranking because of anoying kids and unranks, who knows why I even get matched with unranks. There are many updates and none of which are to fix bugs or get rid of cheaters, they all just for valve to make more money... I end up playing against and with smurfs that ruin the game. I get matched with people that just grief and never get banned. So obviously all the money anybody spends on the game just goes to waste. Please listen to this review and don't buy the game.

I encountered first cheater/smurf in Prime matchmaking. I only want fun with my friends playing competitive MM. So please Valve do something for your community and wake up. It is your game and your community. You should care.

I didn't want to play that game while i was on weed but i accidently double-clicked on the game so it started and I was all like ""okay let's try it out then"".

After I played some games, I started to play competetive too. it really sucks that i had to play until I became Lvl. 3 but in that way you can stop high ranked players to smurf around.

but if you are basic man or woman who play this game after school or work BE CAREFUL ! 

This game is BIG business ! its about money and marketing psychology, strategy and AFTER that its about your fun . But .. it is really fun ??  I SPENt 1176 Hour in this game and  its fun for fisrt 100 h maybe ...whey you play with your friends for fun  .. but  after that  it is about  RAGE , more about your rank  less play with your friends because they have lower ranks or maybe higher . Its about playing 10-20 competetive matches for a day  only because you need ...you MUST HAVE new rank , its not for fun its about your EGO, about WE WONT to prove - we are better than you

7769,"I can't recommend this game after playing +650 hours, the community isn't supportive or fun to play with anymore, the skins and ""mission books"" are just a way to keep making money off the same product that a very large community bought. 

Source use to be fun when you hop into a server and you may or may not find the random a$$hole, but most people where very accepting and use to actually have great conversations and great games...but now its full of intense competitiveness that just makes people upset if you don't do exactly what they tell you when they tell you, even if you do what they tell you they will figure out a way that its still somehow your fault and not theirs at all.

I do like competitive, but people (and trolls) need to lighten up. I know this part of the game and part of that ranking system...but that's why I'm there too. I don't just hop in for fun, I'm still looking for the ""W"". It's more rare these days to find a good set of people when you go into a casual map, but numurous people I know have had to mute everyone because again no one has anything productive or positive to say and it definitely takes away from the game. 

Go play dirty bomb, or...well any other FPS other then this, cause its either going to: A) waste all your time and money or B) waste your breath on this deteriorating community.

UPDATE 05/10/2016:
The community continues to not be supportive and never want to have fun, just win, even on casual. Casual is a place where people are suppost to practise and improve on their game, but when players begin to argue and complain (again) on ways, they do not agree with others and they immediately kick you from the game. DO NOT BUY THIS!!! You are better off finding a brand new game with people who care about the community and to further their own fun while inviting others to do the same. 

Oh, and if you have a stat-trak and want to switch to a new one without losing your kills it will cost you MORE MONEY ($1.30) TO SWITCH A SIMPLE NUMBER COUNTER. THEY ONLY WANT YOUR MOENY, ANYBODY AFFILIATED WITH THIS GAME/COMPANY ONLY WANT YOUR MONEY. I should mention the game is great (minus the hackers, trolls and things like the SSG jump shot kill [which I love] [They took this out in a later update]) if you're just looking to pass some time/hours and just want to blow peoples heads off, go for it.

UPDATE 09/30/2016:
I won't deny the AK ""sounds more real"" (barely), but all these new sounds make the guns sound like toys especially the M4A1-S. More children in the middle of the day play now when they should be in school or something and casual continues to be nothing but trash players and screamers that just want to make you deaf for some reason :/ . If you play this, competative might be your best bet for fun and good people.

UPDATE 11/12/2016:
Just came off a competative match and the group decided to kick me because I wanted to knife the other opponent, they were a bunch of kids all below the age of 14 and had nothing constructive or nice to say at all. I'm going to ask for my money back because this is one of the worst community's to play with along with poor updates and consistently making non-broken maps more broken/""balanced"". I have been playing on and off for years now and it looks like I may stay off this game for forever because of this toxic, unsupportive cretins and terrible company/dev updates that (again) don't help with stupid updates that don't improve the game, just their wallets.

UPDATE 03/07/2017 (MM/DD/YYYY):
Yet again just wanted to kill time, go on for a few casual matches and (as a terrorist) CT's have nothing but awps, autos and negevs for 4 matches in a row!!! Not rounds, games...different matches...same people, same sides, same guns. Literally not worth playing anymore...literally I don't know why I bother anymore. Again, don't buy. You're better off buying ANYTHING ELSE but this terrible time waster. 
I know this review is long, but it's been a small reminder over the last 9 months of on and off play to just stay away, the only reason I keep coming back is just a time filler. Also, with the case drops I just sell them right away for the pennies (it's actually gotten me some good coin for some better cheaper games), it might not seem like much, but once you get that extra dollar it helps for DLC's or those pennies that push you over that ""money limit"" when buying games. I still personally don't recommend this game, but if you choose to buy it, have fun I guess :P

UPDATE 09/07/17:
Literally trash. Would though away if I could. All awpers in casual, no fun in competitive...its a terrible game. Don't buy it.

Don't get me wrong. The game is amazing! Coming up with tactics, learning how to throw neat smokes and flashes was a fun experience. And it's coming from a person who loves fast-paced shooters like Quake and TF2.

In the end though - it's a team oriented game and you'll have to deal with people as toxic as you can possibly get. You won't be able to chill after work, you won't be able to rank up because of the smurfs, you will learn what gambling is. And you will learn russian.

I actually have no clue what players do, when they get a expensive skin. does it give any advantage in the game? No! it just looks 'cool' wich I disagree because most of the skins have totally ret*rded patterns and f*ggot-like colors.

To be fair, kids are probably the most pleasant group to play with cause they mostly try to play well, even if they can't. If you play really, really well - you may be able to ignore the first 2 groups. The rest will still be there.

My biggest complaint towards competitive gameplay is that reporting people doesn't do much, especially reporting for offensive voice / text chat - it's always been merely a placebo button. Global [b]Offensive[/b] jokes aside, you cannot imagine how fed up I am with people losing their shit when I say I am Russian, even if I carry the game and never insult anyone or talk about politics. I'm not going to lie about my nationality to play with a bunch of ignorant frustrated teenagers. What’s funniest – all of that mostly comes from other Europoors who everyone else would confuse with Russians anyway.

Top it up with all the more frequent lags, server instability and general lack of communication from devs on server downtimes and updates, and you’ll have CS:GO.

1-3:
Du solltest auf deinen cs:go konsum achten, ärtze haben festgestellt, dass cs:go das krebsrisiko, je nach eingenommerner dosis, um biszu 90% steigern kann. erste anzeichen einer krebserkrankung sind häufig keuchhusten, ähnlich wie bei 80 jährigen kettenrauchern, eine schwellung an den stimmbändern, was häufig ein krächtzen verursacht, aber auch ein starkes schwindelgefühl und ein allgemeines gefühl von ekel und unwohlsein sind häufige symptome. gönn dir also lieber mal nen paar kubanische, da bist du deutlich gesünder unterwegs.


4-6:
Du solltets über eine chemotherapie nachdenken, zwar werden bei der bestrahlung auch andere wichtige zellen des körpers zerstört oder beschädigt, aber prozentual gesehen wirst du noch eine höhere lebenserwartung erhalten, als durch cs:go. nach der chemotherapie ist es wichtig, wieder in einen geregelten alltag zu finden. die deinstallition von cs:go wird von den hausärtzen dringend emp­foh­len, ansonsten kannst du dich getrost selbst umbringen. nähere anleitung dazu können im internet problemlos gefunden und ausgiebig studiert werden.

7807,"Ok. At first. This game was ok. Meh shoot a bunch of people, play with friends, have fun. You know? No harm done. But as you get really into the game, after about maybe 5 hours in. This unsettling atmosphere surrounds you and really dampens the mood of the game. It's hard to describe, but imagine being covered in a pile of urine soaked bed sheets. Now you may be thinking, it can't be that bad. But I assure you, it only gets worse. Around 7-10 hours in, the urine soaked bed sheets become heavy plates of lead that really choke the life out of you. As you battle to climb the ranking system, you win game after game after game after game. Despite your efforts, you are still stuck with the scrubs of silver 1. Now I'm not a pessimist, so let's say you do, by some godly intervention, rank up to silver 2. The gods have blessed you; you are amazed at how they have answered your persistant efforts to rank up. Hour after hour, click after click as you struggle to defuse and clutch matches. You'd think that you are finnaly redeemed. A true CS GO player. Ready to depart from home, kiss your parents goodbye, and join Cloud 9 in the battle for the championship, earning millions as you do so. You decide to test your newly acquired skills the next day. Logging onto CS GO, itching to pound some CT scrubs. You are Silver II now, no one can smoke the smokes you smoke, no one can clutch the way you clutch, no one can ninja defuse the way YOU NINJA DEFUSE. You are invincible. (Mind you this is completely theoretical. This is not a self projection in any way. Yes I am in Silver 2, but this does not mean that I share the same thoughts as this theoretical ""you"" individual. It is merely speculation to make you understand what it is like to play this game.) In the beginning, everything is fine. The warmup is normal. You buy an AWP and scope down mid toward T side. pick up a few kills left and right. Then die unexpectedly from a stray terrorist by b doors. You chuckle and whisper, ""O o o o o, you got me. Lucky you"", for you know that your silver 2 skills will not let you down. This is just warmup. Nothing big. The match starts. You instantly hear an explosion of sounds in your ears as your teammates scream, ""MIC? ANYONE HAVE A MIC?"" You calmly reply, ""Of Course, an individual such as myself, being at such a level, would not be a true CS GO player if he didn't have a mic."" It's fine. They can scream in their mics. You have experienced such things before. In your SIlver 1 days. But you have moved on. You have evolved. You are better now. Your teammates all go A, expecting a long rush. You however, know better. Confidently, you go B. Waiting by the doors expecting flashbangs and decoy grenades to explode from the entrance of the tunnel as you quickly look away and headshot all 5 terrorists at once. You imagine your teammates, dancing around in pure joy, honored and proud to have such a godly teammate on their side. You are instantly killed. You do not know how. You do not know why. Your teammates laugh at you. You are kicked from the game. The hacker on the other team uninstalls your game and wipes your whole computer. You sit there staring at a black screen. Wondering where you went wrong. You did not go wrong, the game went wrong. And this my friends, is why CS GO is corrupt, toxic, absolutely filled scum. And keep in mind, this is only the thought process of an individual 10 hours in. We can really see a lasting impression on the individual's life around 50 hours. As the lead plates that have suffocated you before, grow in size to the point where you cannot feel anything. You mindlessly go about, playing casual for a few matches. You try to get into the CS GO marketplace where you have heard many have earned millions. This of course doesn't happen. You invest 10$ and you somehow lose 100. I understand this review was long. But you must understand. CSGO is not a game for individuals who like shooting things. It is a game, that takes you by the hand, and squeezes the life out of you. Nothing is as frustrating as failing to clutch a match when your team is up 15-14 and the opponent is lit 99. And that is why CSGO, is a bad game. CSGO, more like Crazy Stupid Game O.

Game itself is really fine. The gameplay, graphic and feel from shooting... Everything's great except for the community.
Game contains several mods while the most popular one -Competitive- is created that if you don't want to be banned from the game for few hours you can't leave it until it's finished. That means you are locked in a game with all this unintelligent creatures for about 40 minutes. The rank system is created so dumb that even if you are better player than the enemy team, and you loose because of your dumb teammates your rank'll be decreased. So it doesn't really matter how good you are, but how good your teammates are. But with this community? 80% Toxic helium voiced kids 10% Trolls 5% High ping players 5% Serious friendly players

But the main point that makes this game great and viable still today has got to be the chickens. They are just great. They waddle around every map inspiring the players, giving them a boost in strength, endurance and a point every now and then. If you are in that mood, just shoot them for some quick target practice and hopefully a new one will spawn somewhere else. And i have to say, the graphics, graphics and the graphics. The graphics are incredible, its almost better than in real life! The chickens look alive and you look at it wanting to stop it from running away just to grab a piece of wing, deep fry it and bite in to it's greasy goodness.

Not only do I think about suicide while playing the game but the community is just so toxic that they couldn’t care less if you quit or not.
With free to play bringing in more people who have vac bans on their main account from ,,TF2 and 1.6'' yet the bans are approximately 2 - 5 weeks old and the only game on their steam account is CS:GO. I love how at one point as well in cancer strikes history hours meant everything, nowadays that's irrelevant because F2P players can get prime for free.
IMO it would have been fine had they been stuck behind the 13$ or so paywall to play with prime players but no its more important to have a ,,growing playerbase'' when in reality you have repeat ,,offenders'' coming with a new account ready to be banned.
Most if not all of the important pro players left and want nothing to do with this shitty excuse of a game, and neither should you. The only aspect of it where you just might find a normal member of the community is surprisingly a third party hosting service like faceit/ESEA.
And the gameplay itself is so mindnumbing, and boring. The most thought i give as the round starts is ,,what gun would be good''. Every single thing is a repeat of the same old same old boring bullcrap.
The best feature that was added and that improved the experience the most is the fact that they added the mute all options, very useful against russians and screaming turks.
The only good thing i have and ever will have to say is that i made such a good mate over it and we both left it to die. 
The sheer ammount of anger and frustration caused by this games bullshit is beyond any, to any who still play it i recommend you to just leave it, let it die a noble death.

All that they did was opening the damn floodgates for every cheater and griefer to ever exist. Don't expect to be able to get a free account and have the same fun that someone with Prime does, because we're not having fun either.

Summary of CSGO in AU/NZ
( I have spent a total of 1k hours of gameplay time on 2 accounts.)
- Toxicity, hundreds and thousands of toxic aussies on every team either not playing properly or drunk playing MM (Accepting to play a COMPETITIVE match with 4 other people)

- Ranking system, trash, got put into a game with 3 people that were under rank 10 against MG1 booster and his customers.

- Anti-cheat, of course it is terrible, Valve's whole idea is to make money from cheaters buying there game.

- You don't get rewarded for playing well, dropping 40 bombs in 1 game and your weekly drop is a P250 Sand Dune, yet someone with 4 kills gets a $10 skin.

CSGO dumps a new coat of paint on CS with better graphics, as well as new game types, matchmaking, and balance tweaks, but the core of it hasn't evolved and the result is something that feels unimmersive and more on the arcade side of things. This is bad for a game that presents itself as a tactical shooter. The weapons are hitscanners. If you're used to playing shooters with proper bullet physics (and leading your targets), this is gonna mess you up. Also, there are no iron sights. Snipers of course have a scope but otherwise it's all essentially hip firing. If you want to knife someone in the face or toss a grenade you have to press a button to switch to them and then press a button again to switch back to whatever weapon you were using prior. There isn't a dedicated button for either. You can bind a key for each but this doesn't completely eliminate the clunkiness. Oh, and you can't go prone either. 

There is one major way this game has been modernized though, but it's not in a way that benefits the player. Micro-transactions. After putting down the base price of the game you get to enjoy being constantly pressured into buying skins (or keys to unlock them). Yay!

So who is this game for? It's for fans of the original CS and CS:S who want to try something similar but different. CSGO is a relic of the past and does nothing better than more modern games in the genre. If you've never played it, you have nothing to gain by choosing this over something else.

7945,"Before you read the review, yes, this is a very wordy but detailed review about the game and this is all MY opinion.


I like how this game makes it so that you have to put time and effort into the game to get good at it, learning the recoil of guns to learning how to manage your economy to how to smoke certain areas if map to give you and your team a major or a slight advantage. However there is a major flaw in this game which I really think ruined the entire experience. And here is my final verdict - 

Good job Valve, forcing people to pay $20 just to have a smooth competitive experience?Good job. When the update was released, I hopped into a prime game and everything was fine and after that game I joined a non-prime game and it was easily one of the worst competitive matches I have ever had. There was 3 rank 2 on the other team and the rest had the loyalty badge which meant that they paid for the game and I have got 2 rank 2 on my team. One of the rank 2 teammates had no idea what he was doing and we ended up getting dominated by the other team whereby one of the rank 2 was top and the rest were bottom he was obviously a smurf. I am not really affected by the update but how about the people who got the game for free? It's not like your anti-cheat system is that effective considering I was once falsely VAC banned on this account and your matchmaking is absolute garbage. They have to pay $20 or play with a bunch of hackers and smurfs?
And here is solid prove that ALMOST every single game you go there will be hackers - https://youtu.be/7sLTopTc4Hc


Edit - Why are people asking for refund? You paid money for this game just to play it earlier and it came with prime, you are paying it for the ""early access"" and prime and you're NOT going to get a refund cause let me remind you, this is VALVE a company owned by GABE NEWELL. Even if so the policies of refund states that if you own a game that is more than 2 weeks old and you have played more than 2 hours you will NOT get a refund. Let's not talk about the refund as it is just a minor issue the bigger problem here is the amount of cheaters and smurfs which are completely ruining the experience for the F2P (Free to play) players.",FALSE

So im in a comp game and 3 guys other that the person im playing with were all smerfs deranking. While the other team was just seemed to be like a normal group within that skill level. So these guys play up untill about round 8 or so and one dude leaves and the other two sit in base. Meanwhile me and my friend that i am playing with are currently attempting to get better at the game and rank up.

-------------------- Edit 6/7/2015 8:19 AM----------------------

The game is filled with hackers and smurfs and Valve uses stupid and uneffective ways to counter them. First the newly intorduced profile ranking system. It is just plain stupid, Whether you like it or not, the main reason most people buy Counter Strike GO is because of the Competetive game mode, the profile ranking system restricts you from joining competetive matchmaking before reaching profile rank 3, which takes ridiculously long with the xp rate from other game modes. Second is the overly sensitive banning system (it had some fancy official name which i cant recall at given time). The banning system is even more ridiculous than the profile ranking, you will get 7 day bans for absurd reasons like your internet disconnecting, or premade 4 man groups kicking you for shit & giggles at match point and yet Valve won't give a fuck at problems like this except on a very primitive level. Lastly the game punishes you for leaving in the middle of competetive match, this is done to discourage ragequitting, and it could work, except when it's not. The game's matchmaking system is so unbalanced that 75% of the time you get to a match where either team gets slaughtered 16-2 or something like that. Of course a game like that makes you want to ragequit, I'm not saying it should be removed, but saying that there should be a better way to handle it. I am still going to play this shitty game because i really like it, but with all of its flaws i cant really recommend it to any new players, and if they still want to buy it at least giving them somewhat honest description of what the game is going to be like. The game has much potential to be something truly magnificent if taken care properly which Valve clearly isn't doing with this many flaws.

8099,"I bought this game when it was released, and stupid me never actively played it until three months ago, when I found that most of my friends were playing Competitive mode like it was all the rage. Before then, I was a Casual lurker and never played Competitive until my friends had introduced it to me, and oh boy, it was soooo fun. For a while. Winning together as a team was quite the ego booster, especially when the whole team has good microphones and knows how to play the game. As you reach the higher ranks, it becomes exponentially more important to be good and to win, therefore the game becomes far more stressful than one could ever imagine in a video game. This game inherently has the potential to break a person, as I will explain. 

I, for one, played with my higher ranked friends against higher ranked players. I was a Silver playing with Gold Novas against Gold Novas. I didn't play as much as my friends because I didn't spend all my free time playing this one game, not to mention that I didn't have much free time in the first place. My friends did, and I watched some of them become arrogant, irritable, and aggressive as a result of playing this game for hundreds of hours. One of them has quit and has become a recluse. Two others quit and moved on to other games. Some of them still play, but not as much.

If I were to judge this game simply for what it is, it's a great game. It's surprisingly dynamic in that there is no one best strategy. Many different ones can be used, and it's entirely up to the players as to how to capture the objective. The graphics are great, and the controls are fluid. But these realities considerably prevent me from doing so. If you buy this game, do your best not to lose yourself as my friend has. Don't let this game become your life. No game is worth ruining your life for, and nothing you do in any game, no matter how noble you believe it may be, will mean [i]anything[/i] in five years. I've nearly ruined my own life on another game before, and this knowledge led me to quit this game weeks sooner than my friends. I still play it once in a while, but I play for the sake of playing and I don't care if I win or not. And I don't need to speak about how horrible the CS:GO community is, as many others have already provided in-depth details which I absolutely agree with.

I wish I could recommend this game, but I cannot. What it can do to people is horrendous and will likely be the subject of some university psychology study next year. After all, there are plenty of other games out there and most of them don't break people like this game does.",FALSE

8121,"I'm going to get crucified for writing this but I don't care.

This game isn't always fun but it's so bad that at times it can be worth playing. I don't see why its overrated but I think its because it is the essential PC game since anything can run it but also the fact that it is over hyped on twitch and YouTube. Playing it from 2012 - 2019 on and off was alright, there were times when it was fun and times when it was just annoying. I think the issue with this game is how repetitive it is, let's be honest there aren't any good gamemodes in this and when you want to do anything other than a comp which involves planting and defusing a bomb, everyone says not to because apparently cs_office isn't a good map anymore and only de_dust 2 should be played. Then you have the people you get in your competitive games, most of the time they'll just throw the game and scream down the mic and call you bad at the game. Then you'll get good players and you'll actually work as a team, but most of the time you'll get throwers. 

But it doesn't stop there. Playing with friends can be fun when you aren't trying to get past Gold Nova 2 or any of the higher ranks because going up there becomes serious that the game is no longer fun to play with friends. But what's the fun in rinsing and repeating plant a bomb or defusing it then getting shouted at by friends or teammates in an endless cycle just because someone wants to get to Gold Nova 3 or try and be a ""cool guy"" and aim for legendary eagle or global elite. The chances of getting up there are 0 unless you sweat out this game 24/7 which isn't fun at all. I have no patience with these type of over-rated shitty games and it's the reason why I won't play League of Legends anytime soon because I know already what I'll be walking into.

The only games that are competitive like this and have proved to be fun, in my opinion, are Overwatch or Unreal Tournament. These games give you countless options and a different game each time whereas here, it's a bit like Call of duty, rinse and repeat, shoot the enemy team, rank up to gold nova, etc etc. Overwatch on the other hand is more based on tactics and skill, how can you counter the enemy team and guiding your teammates but the developers didn't provide enough content for it. It reminds me of Unreal Tournament since that is what Overwatch was inspired by, countless of options to try and engage with the enemy team and different gamemodes. Also, want to know what UT and Overwatch do that COD and CS do not? all the weapons are the same, everyone has the same EXACT experience when playing. On this game and COD, the person who gets an AWP/sniper or uses a shotgun and camps in corners is usually the winner and there isn't a way to counter it sometimes. 

There is no difference between CS or COD. Let's be real, these two are almost the same shit on a different day and anyone praising CS as an ""amazing game"" is wrong. What is so good about this? I also find it a little absurd as to why the game has gone free to play in recent years since most of us back then bought this game at a full price. No matter how many words I write in this review, I'm still going to play this crap again in the future because of friends, I mean 20% of the time it can be a fun game to play but 80% of the time it just isn't. There are many better games you should be playing instead of CS and I'd advise you to play TF2 instead since there is more to do on that but unfortunately that game's community and development is shattered as valve pays no attention to it.

Anyone who told you this game is the ""greatest game ever made"" has no taste in games. All CS GO does is just prove to you how good you can aim an AWP and shoot the other player quickly. That's probably why there are so many throwers nowadays on comp.

For 900+ hours in GO and DMG its sad that their cases only give you 10 cent skins on average, while some new accounts get FN knives worth $300+. The gaming economy is not ment to reward the dedicated and I am not sure how their structure is based.

When I started this game, I was no good - As to be expected, but the community has this God-awful habit of looking down on the lower end players. Now, I am alright as far as I'm concerned, but I cannot for the life of me, push up through the ranks due to issues such as team griefers (Trollers) or 'Smurfs'. These two things are far too common in the lower rank, for the community seems to give the impression that these ranks 'Do not matter' and that you can just piss about to ruin the experience of others.

Yes you can get prime... after reaching Lvl 21 which is still extremely difficult and demoralising when the match is a 5v5 hackerfest. At this point it's ""Pay to Play"" and I mean that literally, thats how bad it is. You would think that it being F2P would bring in more people. True. It did.

I bought the Prime version thinking that somehow there would be less hackers. There are not. Especially in competitive play, blatant hackers abound. Yet innocent, wholesome, clean players who happen to be randomly placed on the same team, often get accused of hacking too. So soon my trust level was affected, which makes none of your friends want to play with you anymore as you get relegated to games filled with hackers. Then you log in one day to find you are banned. No appeal, no right of reply. Despite not hacking, I now have no access to the game, the skins I bought or a way to clear my name (I'd be happy to play with anti-cheat software running, stream my screen... anything!)

Bullets don't shoot straight at all, which makes me wonder if the devs were really just trying to turn this game into a pay2win where killing someone is a matter of RNG. The kids on this game are too obsessed with virtual skins, it's just turning them into future black market dealers. What this game needs is sprinting, killstreaks, and grenade launchers/rocket launchers, as well as aim-down-sights.

However, i have to give this game my first ever bad review.
I believe CSGO has entered the worst state it has ever been in.
This is due to the cheating in this game. The entire community is nervous.
90% of games turns into salty game of people blaming everyone of cheating.
Sportsmanship is fading. Play one good game you get reported and end up in low trust factor.
The developers give no CLEAR information on how this works and what to do to remedy it.
Updates of this game is slow and not focused on improving the game state.
Last contributing factor is the increasing amount of cheating in pro level games.
As a whole it feels that my immediate contacts more or less feels the same and the ""FUN""
factor of the game is just disappearing.

I am slowly starting to lose my respect for this game and might end
up leaving CS for good.

also shame on valve for not being able to ban most of the hackers found in competitive, funny thing is Ubisoft is actually doing a very good job finding hackers with Battle eye on their game, Rainbow Six: Siege, compared to valve lackluster attempt at even doing as such.

8322,"Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is a remarkably authentic nest of the tenacious nature of man's competitive spirit. It is in the team that one may demonstrate their worth against admirable competitors; furthermore, performing on an unmatched level of skill and moxie. For what it is worth, Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is unparalleled in this particular potential, however, it is the absence of what could be that drives me to crave a superior product. CS:GO possesses neither a fair, nor dependable, nor developing architecture for its players. The anti-cheat is comical, the weapon balancing is farcical, and the ranking system is so ludicrous that third-party platforms have been operating to deliver players a competitive setting. The successes of such third-party platforms prove undoubtedly that CS:GO developers have abandoned the competitive habitat that their players reside in; ultimately, flipping the bird upon their most devoted fans. Alack, it is true, but at least they keep going at it adding all those skins ay? Disgraceful.

The conditions in which humans thrive are most notably those with inherent vigorous consistency. Unfortunately, Counter-Strike: Global Offensive does not only defecate on the principles of regularity, but it also mocks those who question it, and most astonishingly, yearns to never mend such issues. The lack of competition with this game has produced love-hate relationships all across the player base, leading to people constantly coming back to the only skill-based competitive first-person shooter that won't die after eight years of sedentary updates. After eight years, one may count all of the considerable game alterations on their 10 digits. Mind you, game breaking issues such as countless amounts of hackers, faulty ranks, and questionable hit registration are still present in the game. Does that mean the game is lousy? Not necessarily. However, the dilemma of yearning for change is only justified when problems are not fixed indefinitely. After a literal petition created by Nick Bunyun, Valve finally attempted to fix hit registration. So is it fixed? I do not know, I am not a game developer, and frankly, I see no reason for me to analyze how poorly the game is designed when Valve knows how poorly the game is designed. 

I always get a kick out of thinking that there are lines and lines of code that everybody in the CS:GO's developer team is afraid to touch because it has not changed for as long as anybody has been in charge of leading CS:GO. A question that comes to mind is does anyone at Valve actually want to make CS:GO a better game? Or do they just want to keep releasing skins whilst the decade old code which has been Counter-Strike as we know it fades and crumbles behind modern competitive titles such as Valorant? The fact that this may even be pondered brings me to my final words. CS:GO is not just bad, it is cruel, vile, and pitiful. God help us.",FALSE

8333,"To the person who sees the bunch of words on this review right now, please read the whole review before buying the game. I'm begging you on my knees. I just need to be heard out, and I'm desperate for someone to listen to me. Don't fucking listen to those guys who put the bull**** reviews saying, ""10/10 would waste my money on knife skins again,"" with a recommendation icon on their review. Counter Strike: Global Offensive is a great game for those seeking a First Person Shooter that will give them an endless amount of fun. Not only is it a First Person Shooter, but it is also a strategic game. In other words, you'll need to actually work with your team to gain the objective. The objective could be escorting a hostage, planting a bomb, or defusing it. You'll have to talk to your team, and be cooperative. Counter Strike: Global Offensive is not a game where you can run in the open area of fire, and kill everyone in one magazine. People will be hiding around corners and they will kill you before you can kill a single enemy. In certain cases, you'll have to be sneaky and utilize the walking mechanic in the game. The suspense really gets to you, and it runs down your spine especially when you're the last one alive. All that being said, no game can be perfect. You know how I said all that stuff about team cooperation in the first few minutes you spent reading this review? Well, that's how the game was MEANT to be played. However, it will only be a dream as no one ever utilizes teamwork. You either have people playing annoying music with their microphones on, or you have people just using the voice communication to flame you whenever you make a mistake. I can write a whole book on my experiences with the players in this game, but I'm not going to do that. Instead, let me just give you a gist of what you're going to dive into. You have players thinking they can/have to win this game themselves because they think their team sucks. People will get mad at you and flame you for every mistake you make no matter how experienced or inexperienced you are. People will tell you to shut up when you're talking too much even though the purpose of your talking is to call out the positions of the enemy. If you respond to them with rage and anger, it'll only build their anger up as well leading to them talking about how they're gonna fuck your mom and give you cancer. I won't go into all that terrible trashtalking stuff. What's worse is that if you ignore them or try to reason with them, they'll only get more annoying. The muting option doesn't help because you still know that they're talking shit about you and your family. In addition, the mute option totally defeats the purpose of team communication. Nowadays, people just use the mute button to mute everyone so they can play a TEAM game solo. So now that I've told you some of the things you'll be running into when you buy this game, let me tell you a little something. Don't let those people infect you. When people flame you, the flame spreads unto you like it does to a tree in a wildfire. That leads to you actually becoming them. Don't let them make you hateful. I hate to say it, but the best option you have right now is to mute them. The first negative thing you hear them say, immediately mute them. It won't do you any good to listen to them spread their hate towards you. Sorry for dragging you along a review tunnel full of negative stuff. Now let me give you some positive things. You actually can meet great people that play the game the way it was MEANT to be played. They communicate with you, help call out enemy positions. In addition, they don't flame you when you make a mistake. Instead, they actually laugh in a positive manner. Then they tell you how you could do this or that better. No, they're not telling you how to play the game. They're telling you how to get better at playing the game. These guys are like 20-25 years old though lol. You have a low chance of finding a guy like that in a sea full of flaming 12-19 year olds thinking they're god at this game, and that they know where your mom lives. Now that I'm done being specific, it's time to get general. Good: gameplay. Bad: community and people that play this game. Now I could have just written that in my review, but I don't like hiding bull**** with you guys. In the end, some people would argue that if you just ignore the bad community, the game is 100x better. Cut the crap guys, you can't ignore a community this big. It will get into your brain sooner or later. Even just one flaming person can ruin the game for the whole team, causing them to lose. I'm so fucking mad at people who hide the bull**** of this game because they are part of the flaming community that turned nice people into assholes. Don't take this bad community shit lightly. I really do you hope you read this whole review. If you did, you are one of the greatest people on Earth. I've been playing this game for months, and I just needed to get all that crap off my chest. Thank you so much from the bottom of my heart. Now as a conclusion, I'm 100% confident to say that I won't recommend this game to anyone.",FALSE

Now today I see CS:GO has become F2P with the new update. This brings some cons to the game eg:
1) The servers are very unstable as of now, multiple people I know couldn't play, etc.
2) Prime matchmaking was used to give a more 'fair' expercience to those who had prime, BUT by now making it buyable I doubt that will be the case in the future.
3) The new BR is decent, it has it's cool elements but also a lot of weird and boring things.
One of the nice things is that I can see people that I know that couldn't afford the game (as strange as it sounds) actually have a chance to play with their mates.
My general opinion on this game is mixed even though I enjoy playing it with friends. 
Solo queing on comp can sometimes be an absolute nightmare but it can also be nice to find new friends etc.
I payed 13Euro for something free, granted I still have prime so I won't complain that much. 
With that said: I don't recommend this game because even though it's a fun game, recent updates have kind of screwed the game. Wayy to much: Hackers, Smurfs and a lot of toxic ass players. Hope to see cs get revived one day but I'm not sure if the good game I used to know will be the same.

8367,"Deleted original review so TL:DR: the game was getting bad and it's only gotten worse.

Wrote my original review years ago (just noticed I am officially updating this review on it's 5th year anniversary, 5th July), essentially said the game had many growing problems including cheaters, smurfers, boosters, toxicity and delusional ego-driven players that are actually awful at the game but think they're good at it even though they have accomplished literally nothing else throughout their entire life besides being MG2 with 2000 hours.

Nothing has changed since, the cheater and toxicity issue has only gotten worse to the point where it feels like older and newer players alike purposely decide to play ignorantly when they’re bad at the game and to top it off Valve feels as disconnected from the community as ever; yet, I keep coming back every few months or so for some reason… anyways good luck getting into this game now if you haven’t played it before, you have to either be completely self-hating or just not know any better. I don’t really like Valorant but if you had to choose between this and Valorant (and you haven’t played either yet), just go and play Valorant, at least Riot gives half a shit.

To those who currently play or actually still want to get into this game for some reason (from a competitive perspective), my only tip to you is that you're not good, you’re bad, I have thousands of hours and even though I am in the top 2 or so percent of players technically speaking, I am still bad, there are always better players and things you don’t know or understand completely, that is the beauty of CS, it’s a never-ending journey. Learn from other players and understand when others are just being toxic so you know who and who not to listen to, if you want to play proper CS, after you’ve really learned the basics to the point you understand basic game-sense, aim, spray-control and other aspects of the game (watch YouTube videos to understand what you should be learning in CS), go to FACEIT (a third-party matchmaking service with players who somewhat care), you’ll move on from there.

CS:GO is a game in which you, as a smurf, are not to blame, a game in which the rank system is so bad that even the dumbest person in the world would make a better one. A game in which, if you have a bad computer, you will get a ban because you did not have enough time to get into the game because you thought that your computer can run on minimal requirements but it can't run it because the requirements which are written on the sale page are the old ones. A game in which after each death you need to think about whether the person who killed you was a cheater or a smurf or just a lucky guy. CS:GO is iPhone in games.

A lot of matches I play will have at least 1 player leave early in the match. AFAIK these unbalanced matches still effect your rank and you don't even get a bot to control after a teammate dies.

8396,"EDIT: I contacted Valve and they still haven't given me a reason for a VAC-ban, there is no proof of a ban. If you want to spend 20 dollar and a pass on half-assed update, go ahead.

This review is only focusing on the negative parts of the game. There are a lot of amazing stuff in CS:GO that is great. But there are also a lot of negative stuff in it which I am gonna go in-depth to. So in my opinion...

Broken rank system, awful community and an even more broken anti-cheating system.

Basically I was placed in a low rank (around silver), did my best in order to climb the ranks but was reported by a dumb degenerate player for hacking. I was banned shortly after. 

This game is not created for fun, but for contest people. I give up this game where you put hard work and love into it, but get shit like broken updates, a development team who doesn't listen to their fans, premade accounts, hackers and an anti-cheating system that doesn't work properly and bans the wrong people and let's cheaters stay.

So basically this game punishes you if you even have fun. Do note that this is my own opinion and I really don't care if you're having fun with it or not, but I know that a lot of people agree with me.

Conclusion:
If you're new to FPS games, don't consider touching this because you're gonna go through a lot. Heck, even if you're a veteran player don't even because of all the stuff I mentioned earlier.

This game is dying and for a good reason. I am never touching this again unless for a good reason.",FALSE

8413,"There was a time (late 2013 - beginning 2015) when CS GO was a thing : great FPS-game with a decent community, a lot of operations to work with, good-looking skins, decent drops in-game and lots of them (new operation cases dropping like crazy, that you could sell and buy some keys too, with it), a lot of trading ! (do you remember those times guys ? :D). Such times where, even Silver ranks had decent people with decent aim...not what we have in 2018 (from 2016 onwards); Nova ranks that can't even move the fu  cking mouse around, let alone talk about aiming. People that used their brain, to control the map, to win. Times where smurfing wasn't a thing. Times where CHEATERS WERE IN LOW NUMBERS AND IN THE LAST TIER OF GLOBAL RANK. Times where you could play the original CS maps, like Assault and Militia and Aztec ; where you could play hostage maps in competitive !

What do we have now in 2018 ? Servers full with cheaters, at any level. Maybe the low Silver tier is the exception, the rest is fiiled with CHEATERS ! 4/5 games you find cheaters. You queue for competitive, you find yourself with cheaters. You queue for wingman, you find yourself with even more cheaters (it's a playground for them, you see, they even ""host"" hacks vs hacks mode). You queue for fu  cking casual, you find sometimes even here cheaters ! And they are that kind of filth that don't even hide their cheats here (here they don't get reported, a good way to test/ screw a little with cheats...people don't even bother to report them). And EVEN if you do report them, with the whole server, it takes AT LEAST 7 days to maybe, MAYBE, to get a ban. But Overwatch is not working for casual, so you might as well just surrender yourself to the cheaters, change the server or ALT+F4 the game.

What else do we have ? Smurfers. Lots of them too. Even at Silver level, you find high-level players that ""they wanna have some fun wrecking some noobs"" you see, their reasoning, but they are so low that they can't keep up to the ranks that they are and instead, they come lower rank to crush some noobs and make themselves feel good, because they suck at their tier. I bet these guys are the type from school that went to beat younger-age boys to feel ""warriors"", because they couldn't mess with one of their size.

What else do we have ? Low-quality player base overall, but most of it made of turkish and slav-filth. Angry-raging russian and turkish kids screaming on mic. Every time I need to block them to be able to bear the game. They don't speak english at all, so why should I even bother to listen ? All they know is ""rush B"" and ""cy ka"". ""I don't speak london !"". I live in central Europe, why every fu  cking game I need to play with these inferior filths that don't use their brain at all ? The only purpose of their heads is to serve the purpose of not getting the rain in their throat, trust me on this ! People with 0 kills in round 8, telling me what to do or where my skill lies. Get the fu  ck out of here, inbreed-rats !

What else do we have ? Ah, map restrictions and removals. Now you are supposed to play ""certain"" maps in competitive, because they are the ""meta"". It's a fu  cking MOBA now, we only play heroes that are MVP-stars in the patch. FU  CK active duty !! >>> I am tired of dust 2 and mirage and inferno and nuke. Fu  ck cobble too, for all it's worth, such a sh  it map that even the pro players sh  it on it, that's why it got removed recently. I am playing these maps for years, FOR YEARS, do you get it ? All I wanted was, hostage map mode rework, if not the maps themselves. I play CS since 99', I was BORNED on the fo  cking Assault (fo ck as the englishmen say !) ! And they removed most of the classic maps, you can't even fool around on them anymore. Valve sh  its on hostage maps, they do so for 6 years, but detonation mode is no exception, maps like dust 1, vertigo, aztec ?! All deleted from the game, and let me tell you something : at the pace Valve works fixing a map (6 months to 1 year for one single fu  cking map), we will never see those maps again in the game.

And to wrap this overall : What VALVE does about all this ? Nothing ! Absolutely NOTHING ! There are bugs, existing since the beta, that were not fixed. And they will never be fixed. It took them 6 years to fix the fu  cking molotov bugs...oh but wait ! they are still not fixed properly. There are even molotov glitches that players exploit for better visibility. Hit detection is still A FU  CKING MESS. You shoot entire mags in them and they still ""no damage taken"". People with high-ping, instead of being at disadvantage, they fu  cking own you with their ping because the server reports them at locations that they aren't. 

Cheaters ? Well let me tell you the reality : cheaters = is what keeps the game alive, you see. They will never be banned entirely, not even if they catch them all. Yea they ban in waves sometimes, to raise the morale of the peasants that ""wow valve thx you really care 4 the game I love u, I buy more crates when my momma gets her paycheck !!"". But cheaters is what makes this game still stand ; they put money into the game. Same with smurfing ! 
The real definition of VAC is = Valve-Allows-Cheating ! And it has been like this since 2015, if not since always. Look at the hacking scandals on E-sports, so many teams cheating for a greater show. And they are allowed to ! It's like TV shows, it raises the audience and makes them money. Money is what Valve is after for, not a ""proper FPS game that will last for decades"", like their predecessor, CS 1.6 .

Where is Source 2 upgrade ? Where is the audio codecs upgrade from Source 2/ Dota 2 ? 64-bit mode ?! This is not 2007 anymore, there are developers like New World Interactive (known for Insurgency and Day of Infamy) that upgraded their source engine version of the game to 64-bit ! A small indie company did it, but a millionaire corporate company like Valve with big budget and personnel, can not ?!?! OH ! But they are working on a big update ! It's called panorama UI. A fu  cking user-interface upgrade. Like the players of CS GO would GIVE A FU  CK about news repositioned on the home screen or patch notes in a smaller window. Nothing more joyful when the game has so many bugs and cheaters, but to press ESC and see that the options menu is repositioned. Outstanding ! A really, but really, FU CKING JOKE !

People, there are even free-to-play FPS-games, way better than CS GO. Much cooler gun play and mechanics, more realtistic recoil-patterns, more guns, better maps, better BALANCE and most of all, LESS CHEATERS ! You just need to get out of the sphere of this sh  it game called ""CS GO"" and try some others. I promise you, you will find, as now in 2018, better FPS-games than CS GO, even free ones.

Forget this game ! It was nice for the time it lasted, but now it's over. Stop supporting a sh  it FPS-game, full of bugs, of smurfers, and cheaters. Valve only cares about selling pink-skins to rip you of your money, but they deliver sloppy-crappy updates like ""sounds rework and 1 gun rework in one year"". There are developers out there with better games, that really try hard and put effort and passion in their games, and deserves your attention ! Just try it.

However, in CS:GO, they have done it properly. The game feels more polished than ever, and there has been some great additions to gameplay, as well as balance tweaks.

I applaud VALVe for keeping the game feeling ""Classic"" whilst adding in a new layer of modern day goodness.

CS:GO as any of the CS games has, one of the most addictive and challenging gameplay ever. Technically the game is perfect: good graphics, fast respond updates to bugs and problems. One of the best anti-cheat systems in the world. Yep, better than Blizzard's. (You may not agree with the sentence about the anti-cheats, but I will explain this down.) And, even the market for ""goods"" and DLCs is perfect. It's focused on the older and more experienced players. Lots of ""skins"" for the new players and new ""operations""(maps) for the older players. The more you play, the better this game becomes. Like I said, technically perfect on any aspect. The problem comes form the game community. You may agree with, that the most of the players in this game are 12 years old kids with urgent desire to sleep with your mother. And, after few hours with the game you will become a polyglot linguist, mostly in slavic phiology (Polish, Russian). But this aren't the main problem. The problem is in the COMPLETE tolerance, the COMPLETE ignorance and the COMPLETE lack of knowledge from the community, about the CHEATERS. This game possess one of the most complete anti-cheat systems. It covers every aspect of the game: VAC- automatic anti-cheat program, Overwatch system for precise observation. This two programs are in constant communication with the main game and the ""Matchmaking system""- so, all of the cheaters to end playing against each other and to get banned. But, ...BUT... This system relys on, the ""willingness"" of this community to use this system, to deal with the cheaters. Unfortunately, by this complete negligence the system is doing more damage to the people who are willing to help by using it. Rather than to the cheaters.

You might think - hey, thers not that many cheaters. Wrong. Even on casual i see people spinbotting with 600+hrs. MM is freaking joke (can't kill afk cause they dont register shots), shooting is 0 fun ( one tap enemy into head, hit for 1 cause programming is hard ). Also small tip : Don't waste money or don't waste much. There are many developers which actually use your invested money to improve game/peformance/gameplay.

Rather than working together people flame and are of no use at all.  My biggest gripe is definitely the new rank system. The fact they level lock competitive is annoying.,FALSE
8467,"[b]Note:[/b] Valve is known for providing continuous support and updates for the game. I have more notes in this later on in the review.

[h1]Overview[/h1]
Counter-Strike: Global Offensive (CS:GO) is a tactical multiplayer competitive first-person shooter which is part of the Counter-Strike series.

[h1]Graphics & Sound[/h1]
I have no complaints on either the graphics or the sounds.
The graphics are not something you'll praise this game for, but they're not bad at all. Map design is great yet simplistic so you can focus on the gameplay. I must say that the detailed remakes of classic maps look and play terrific.

[h1]Gameplay[/h1]
Counter-strike is unique from almost every other shooter because it requires constant thinking, focus and teamwork from every single player. It forces you to think differently than in other modern shooters.

CS:GO has many gamemodes to choose from; Arms race, Demolition, Deathmatch, Casual and Competitive and also supports player-hosted servers which can contain their own gamemodes. Although I will be focusing on the main part of the game, which is the competitive gamemode.

In competitive mode two teams of 5 play against each other in a 30 round match. After the first 15 rounds, the two teams switch sides, this is so you always have to play each side of the map. The first team to win 16 rounds wins the game. If both teams win 15 rounds, the match will end with a tie. How long a match takes ranges between 30 and 90 minutes, but will generally be around 45 minutes.
Playback of games will be saved for a short period of time, you can always watch them back or download them yourself so you won't lose them. You can also share these with others.

You can create a party with your friends or find a game on your own. It's possible choose which maps you want to play, so you can always play your favourite maps.
Each player has a skill group, this skill group represents how skilled you are at the game. When searching for a game it will always find people with ranks that are close to yours.
Players new to competitive will not have one yet, but will gain one after winning 10 matches. Players without a skill are limited to winning 2 games a day. 

The difference from competitive mode and the other gamemodes is that players are required to play more strategically and work together as a team. Once you die you won't respawn until the round has ended.
Your team also earns money each round, this depends on how many kill you get, bomb you plant, if you win the round (and some other factors), using this money you have to communicate with your team what to buy; do you buy full armor and weapons? Will you wait a round and buy the next round? Do you just buy pistols? This is one of the examples why communication is key in this game.

[h1]Anti-Cheat[/h1]
Currently official servers run Valve Anti-Cheat (VAC), which simply said is plain terrible. I've talked to multiple people who code cheats for counter-strike and they have no problem getting past VAC at all, they say that community-made anti-cheats are more difficult to counter, but sadly the official servers do not have these.

Now there's the 'Overwatch' system, basically how this works is if someone gets reported enough times, they will be put in the Overwatch systems. Then a few of specifically chosen players (players with a medium+ rank and ~150+ wins) review a replay of his game and decide if he is breaking any of the game's rules.
And this is a great idea, the only wrong thing about this is that it takes about 6-10 reports (this number is unsure but confirmed to be above 5) to even get in there; which means you can easily play a few games without even getting banned.

Now they recently implemented a system called 'Prime', if your account is a Prime account it will only be matched against other Prime accounts. To make your account a prime account you need to verify a phone number with it.
This system is implemented to stop cheaters from simply repurchasing the game after being banned. I think this is a huge step.
Yet this still doesn't really stop cheaters/smurfs/griefers/derankers or other groups breaking the game's guidelines. Sure it decreases it by quite a bit, but there's still a huge path to go.

Now I understand that every games has cheaters, and that this is impossible to fully stop. But that's no excuse because Valve can certainly do a lot more than they are doing now.

[h1]Updates[/h1]
I personally feel like Valve stopped caring about so many things. Instead of focusing on important things they add things like spray paints, gloves or more skins; this gives off an idea that they're all about money.
And the game servers are still running on 64 tick, this is outdated and can cause inaccurate gameplay results; this is not excuseable for a competitive game. Get 128 tick servers already, Valve!

Also a lot of thing can be done about balance, especially on the weapons, and many bugs need to be fixed.
And don't get me wrong, every now and then an update fixing bugs and balancing things come out; usually based on feedback from players. But this happens to rarely; this game released over 5 years ago; how much more time and how many more chances does it need?


[h1]Pros and Cons[/h1]
[b]Pros:[/b]
+ Price
+ Optimization
+ Sound
+ Playback your games
+ Steam achievements and trading cards

[b]Cons:[/b]
- Bad anti-cheat
- Could improve on balance
- Community
- Hit registration / accuracy

[h1]Conclusion[/h1]
The game itself is pretty good, but the way the developers deal with it at the moment could be better.
How enjoyable your experience is depends on the players you play with, and I wouldn't say this game has a good community.

8477,"So after not playing the game for about roughly a year I decided to have a game of competitive with my two friends. Loaded it and we found out we had two derankers on our teams. Two people that would just sit there the whole game doing fuck all, like how sad and boring could you be. They also decided to shoot me and my friends to ensure they lost thier rounds meaning in some occasions I had to kill them to ensure I would live and have a chance at actually winning the round but resulting in a 30 minute ban for team damage.

About a year ago I would recommend this game as I did play it alot, but now its nothing more really as a boring, item hoaring game that people try to make money out of, and the ranking system has just utterly gone to hell. I wouldn't really buy this game for the competitive side. I do on occasion play custom maps with friends and thats really the only fun I ever get out of it anymore.",FALSE

It frustrates me beyond belief knowing that cheaters I played against, have not been banned months later. Cheaters in counter-strike have completely destroyed this game for me, rendering the game unrewarding and 90% of the time frustrating. 

I've been in several CGo teams, and made many friends along the way. If anyone would like to buy my skins at discounted prices, please let me know. I'd rather spend money elsewhere.

This can include telling the enemy team your team's positions, team killing, and other shit like that. 2nd problem is that the matchmaking system is so shit that it physically puts you against super good people with a terrible team. This can be stupid because for example, if you're trying to rank up and you need one more game, it will be physcially impossible to rank up in any matter. Hitreg is shit and can fuck itself. I hit a noscope right on the head and it counted as a fucking leg. Furthermore, the mechanics are poor and are fucking shit. You will play against a lot of smurfs and trolls no matter what fucking rank you are which is very poorly designed. I am very addicted to this game and I want to stop, but I can't simply because of trying to win and rank up to Global or LE. If you don't make any friends on csgo, and you are playing matchmaking expect to fucking win 10% of the time. The cheating system is quite slow and stupid. You have to have a amount of people report a guy and then it goes through a month of waiting to overwatch and then the judge finally decides if that person gets banned or not. but SIMPLY, my issue is that I keep playing with the worst teammates who can not call out, have no teamwork, can't fucking trade kills, and cannot call out any plan for the team to go.

You know about the toxic community and the rampant cheaters and I'm sure you even learned the intricacies of pronouncing акус ьтялб while playing. That's however not the reason why this is a negative review. The plain reason is, this game is boring as hell.

Sure the competitiveness is good when you're in a nice outfit, guns handle nice and there is a high skill ceiling. But there is not enough variation to tickle your fancy for a long time. There used to be 'Operations' that brought some nice and refreshing maps into the pool every now and then, but the operations seem to have died a silent death the equal we haven't seen since Episode 3. So that leaves you to playing the same maps over and over again.

Every now and then they get a face lift and sometimes they even add a previous Operation map to some insignificant map pool and that's it. The rest of the variation comes from cosmetics that you have to pay for because you only get $ 0.03 sticker drops. Every couple of months they add another insignificant type of cosmetic that used to be free in 1.6 and Source (i.e. skins and graffiti) that lack any originality. I'm sure they will add tattoos next.

Aside from matchmaking the whole game seems to be dead. Casual is just a chore. Public servers are tucked away in some dark corner of the in-game browser. What's left is the routine of grinding the same maps over and over again into unimaginable boredom.

hear this valve... 19 out of 20 people in low rank match are hackers... how the hell they get new steam profile and play ridiculously shit... im no noob... every tactic i used they always 1 step ahead... how can they play like a god and beaten me like im a penis... ive been playing games for 26 years now and i cant even match with lower rank in csgo? they were hackers and if i want to report its alot of them... been using all kinds of different hacks until im confused how tf they play like a god...

8610,"ah, cs:go. where do i even begin.

do i recommend this game to people? no
do i enjoy this game? yes
why am i not recommending this game to other people? you'll find out

one reason is cuz you'll probably quit within the first hour of playing. because the learning curve for this game is so high. for beginners, it's pretty hard to try to aim and shoot other players, because the average ""amateur"" at cs:go is already like a decent skill level (most of the time). when you join, everyone will be better than you and you're going to have to spend a lot of time to even get up to what is considered ""beginner level"", and also everyone will be laughing at you and calling u weird names or shooting you even if  you're on the same team as them, bc you're going to be so bad at the game that impatient and ""pro"" players are going to express their frustration. they might even kick you from the session. scratch that. they WILL kick you from their game. (oh if you've played FPS before though, some of your skills will transfer. unless you played overwatch. that one doesnt count).

that being said, yeah, a toxic gaming community is another reason you might wanna leave. unless, i don't know, you enjoy being cursed at and abused. hey, i don't judge. players are really sensitive about their rank in cs:go's ranking system, which gives ppl badges on how good they are, and people really don't want to lose their rank. you gotta understand that this is some people's l i v e s, and there are a lot of 12 year olds who think they're gonna go pro. so be prepared for someone half your age to start shooting profanities at you, or otherwise be not very P.C.
this game is not for liberal snowflakes.

...

huh? how did i get into cs:go? well i'm glad you asked

i play just for funsies, many times with frendos i know in real life (so then i dont get kicked from games for being too bad :^) ). am i good at cs:go? no. but again i don't take this game very seriously haha.

i also play with no comms. except on discord when im playing with frendos. in cs:go u can turn off voice chat, so go figure. so i cant hear what that 10 year-old is assuming about my sexuality, and i can't hear kids whining about how they're getting totally owned by some dude in his mom's basement. so yeah that's why the toxic gaming community doesn't bother me. granted though, there are some pretty nice and non toxic cs go players too :)

i also spend most of my time in casual rather than competitive games, bc ppl dont care if they win or not in those games (most of the time). i can be as bad as i feel like. sure i enjoy a good competitive game or two now and then, but usually with frendos cuz then i can actually communicate w ppl.

when i first started cs:go i was predictably pretty bad. but hey, it was during a global pandemic and my brother bought me this game like 6 years ago, so i was like, hey, why not. it didn't frustrate me to have 0 kills, 1 assist, and 14 deaths by the end of the match. i just liked running around with the auto-shotgun XM1014 and then like tryna blast ppl, and then laughing about it when i got invariably d e s t r o y e d by the enemy. it was funny to me. i was just there for the experience, yo.
175 hours in and i should hope that i'm at least one caliber better at this game, but my perspective playing the game is still the same. sometimes i get totally owned, sometimes i own the opponent, and sometimes i find someone playing around my level. but i don't care, i'm just here to enjoy a good time headshotting some guy on the T team with an M4 assault rifle. i'm just here to chill.

ah yes, i guess i should talk about the gameplay. you get a good variety of rando guns to choose from. game concept is easy. point and click adventure! click on the guy's heads and you'll be golden. just make sure they don't click your head first. also yeah forget everything you know about physics. when you shoot, it can sometimes end up way off your crosshair. just make sure to shoot in small bursts so you can control your recoil when you're starting out. unless you have the machine gun. just hold down the trigger or something and spray wildly :^)

while shooting guys in this game is fun, i much more enjoy playing mind games with my opponent. make them think i'm here, but i'm actually there, and bam! i got him! mwahahaha. or try to hide in weird places or sike them out of their hiding spots. i think that's where i have the most fun in this game. 

so take it easy man. i mean the common saying is that the more toxic a cs:go player is, the better they are at the game. that's kinda tru tbh. but man, i can't even hear what you sayin' anyway.

you must be thinking i actually quite enjoy this game. and yeah, i guess i do - sometimes. cs:go's matchmaking system is kinda wonky at times. the game is most fun when i get matched with players of similar skill. but sometimes i'll get placed in a match full of pros and i'd be like 0_o . not as fun but i'll still enjoy being totally #rekt i guess. they're fun to watch and it's a bit more gratifying to catch a tougher opponent off guard sometimes. so matchmaking can be pretty hit or miss. but ooh man,  when i find that good difficulty match, the game is a real blast just trying to think like the enemy, where they'd go perhaps, and trying to be one step ahead. you get that adrenaline goin' and you feel like you have a chance of clutching a win for your team.

and you know, it's also just greatly satisfying to just get someone. like you basically putting them out of the game for a certain amount of time. i'm like haHA you dont get to play for like a 30 seconds. that is until, some guy with the AWP shows up behind me and then snipes me. and then i'm like oh. that's karma i guess.

so, if u inspired and wanna play cs:go like i do
1) eh, don't care about the ranks. i'm literally a silver 1
2) play without comms
3) play as badly skilled as u wanna play (maybe avoid competitive tho if u do that)
4) don't get frustrated when someone kills u. its just a game man
5) play with frendos who also wanna play

other things:
graphics? yes this game has graphics.
oh you wanna know if theyre good graphics? yeah i guess theyre good
oh you wanna know more? i don't really care, i mean theyre good but it's an FPS, i didn't come here looking for beautiful landscapes.

so yeah, i mean, if you just some person like me who wanna waste some time dying a lot in an FPS and eventually be like not bad at the game...then i would personally recommend this to you
or if you wanna be really good that's fine by me too
but to the everyday person...it's probably not your thing haha. unless????

Counter-Strike Global Offensive is the worst game I have ever played.
Not because it is actually bad or unplayable, but because It has ruined years of my life that I can never get back.
First the good because yes there are good parts to this, it is well made and has comprehensive gunplay and great map designs, some of which have been deleted from the game which is a shame because the greatest maps are the ones that were originally in 1.6 and got upgraded here.
The problems arise with competitive play, this is actually the worst matchmaking system I have ever experienced.
Mind when I played there were no Prime Matchmaking or write your phone number for authentication feature.
As a new player the learning curve is something that keeps players occupied, trying to learn and get better while they get shafted by the horrific matchmaking and obscene amount of hacking and smurfing in lower ranks.
You might say I know nothing since I played only 271 hours.
Wrong, when I was Silver I was pressured into using a ""Radar Hack"" which helped me find enemies, yes this is where my VAC ban comes from.
Do I regret it? Absolutely but this was around 2014 when I was way younger and impressionable. My friends and the opressive toxicity forced me to resign to this means to win.
Getting banned is the end of this game right?
Wrong again, I made another profile and continued on this downwards slope for around 1500 hours.
Eventually I got out of Silver, but my friends didn't make it.
Higher rank play is where the actual torment began. Getting used to the addictive nature of competitive and realizing that there is so much wrong with the community that none of the ranks are escape from the Abyss what you will feel when carrying the non bilingual Russian squad and then getting mass reported by them for being bad.
There are countless videos explaining why this is horrible and you have seen the memes, but never forget that this addiction is just like alcoholism, destructive towards everyone you care for and eventually destroying yourself.

1. Players who bought the Game some years ago, before it was F2P (like me, and all of my Friends) AREN'T in the ""Prime-Status""-Matchmaking Group anymore. We should buy it for like 14€. After we actually bought the Game! And after we WERE in that Matchmaking-Group for Years! (Before it was F2P you had to add your Phonenumber, and that was it to get Prime). So Valve wants us to  pay twice for a Game and its Features. 

2. Since the last Update - this shattered-web stuff - its clear were this F2P-Shit should goin to. I dont want to be too rosy - I understand that one wants to make money, especally with a F2P-Game. 
But what CS needs are (way more) Maps, instad of takin' good ole' ones out. Maybe some new Weapons as well and maybe a graphics-update.
What CS:GO does not need is an Manga-Like Skin for the Character-Models. The Game-Style is goin' to be like Anime-Manga-Japan-Dunno-What-Thingy.

3. You aren't able to get Stuff with ""Grind"", like its the way in most F2P-Games - you have to buy chests and Battle-Passes or whatever. (The Battle-Pass only allows you to get Chests - to open those, you have to buy Keys - so you buy stuff to be allowed to buy other stuff. Ehm...what?)

8713,"So, CS:GO, in itself has really taken a turn from just a game that everyone could just relax and play, trade nice and easy, and just have a fun time. Then turning into a chaos.

Due to many scams and things valve enabled a seven day trade ban on cs items. This did slow it down, but many people were not happy with this. Valve also took action on many third-party websites not allowing the bots to trade items and such. Many websites were shut down because of this.

Also, they've also banned keys from being traded. Keys were commonly traded for items and now they are no longer able to traded.

About gameplay, it just has taken a slippery slope. I'm not talking about the actual game mechanics but more about the environment of a normal Valve matchmaking competitive match. Valve released an update for CS:GO on August 12, 2018 (i could be wrong i couldn't find it exactly) that allowed any account that had paid $15 for the game had a loyalty badge and was upgraded to the Prime status. The original way to get there was to have a registered phone number and to get to level 21. Ever since that update, there had been more cheaters than ever before. People didn't have to buy accounts but instead used their alts they weren't ever gonna touch. This made matchmaking terrible for anyone with a low trust factor. It has settled down a tad bit but I wouldn't do anything to get a lower trust factor.

If we are talking about the gamemodes, they can get really repetitive. Sure, if you need a break from competitive style playing you can play modes like a battle royale (Danger Zone), a game with moon gravity and snipers, gun game, deathmatch, and more. In the end, it's clicking heads and which team can win the game. No matter what gamemode you play, it always requires teamwork for victory.

I also don't know exactly what caused this but there seems to be a lot more toxicity within the community as of now. It's hard to find a Valve matchmaking game without someone insulting you whether if it's about your ability to play the game or just try to beat you down mentally. You also have people whining about missing their or losing an easy clutch and then end up throwing or leaving if the game doesn't end up their way. This makes games just make you lose interest and all of a sudden stop playing. This has definitely ruined the experience for me in the long run.

All of the downsides out of the way, we finally got an operation! After two years and begging Valve found it in their hearts to make another operation + a big update. This update had weapon changes, another danger zone map, new playable casual/competitive maps, missions, and more. I was quite excited about this because this is my first operation I've participated in and it's quite fun. It's nice to see this work from Valve after what all has happening.

One thing I like about the community is that they never stop to impress me on new crazy jumps, strategies, utility usage, etc. This stuff always makes me curious on what I will wake up to tomorrow seeing the endless amount of creativity the community has to offer.

With all this aside, CS:GO can be enjoyable with the right people. If you have a group of people you can always hop on the game with have a blast, this game is so much fun. Queuing by yourself is a gamble on where you will find a variety of teammates. Sometimes you get lucky, but taking that risk as a new player is not advised in my opinion. If you can start out the game with someone you know and can rely on to help you out on your way to becoming the best you can be in this game, then go for it. You'll need it. Trust me.

8726,Can’t stand the hackers great game but making it free was the worst decision in the history of steam,FALSE
8727,"Right, where to start?

I picked up CS:GO because my friends had been playing it and I wanted to join in. After I got to about 10 hours of playtime, they stopped playing and so did I. A few months later, I picked the game up out of the dusty recesses of my steam library and played it again. And I'm so glad I did. This game is fantastic, not perfect by a long shot however. 

Let's go over the good things first. The gameplay is fantastic and has a very high skill ceiling due to spray patterns, all the different weapons, tactics, etc. In games like CoD, whoever wins an interaction is down to who shot first. However, with this game, it's down to who can recoil compensate, hit headshots and crouch spray better. Of course, if you have less experience, you're going to get murdered in the beginning.  But it's all about the learning curve and once you have it down, oh boy it's so much fun.

Now for the negatives. Cheaters. We all know and hate them. But they plague almost every single casual match. I cannot get into casual or deathmatch without running into a guy with his stupid snapping aim. If VAC actually worked, almost none of these people would be around. But the fact is, they are still around because valve refuses to update their anti-cheat software, that has been in use since 2002. 

The only option is to go play competitive. But that takes a really long time to get into a match for me where I am, and almost every comp match I do get into, there's a smurf in the match. Some guy has bought the prime status upgrade on a free CSGO account, and is now using his Global Elite level skill from his other account, to murder people who are Silver 1. Or they're just a hacker.

Another thing I really do not like about this game is the amount that loot boxes are insentivised. Me personally, I do not like loot boxes. And the excuse ""But they're only cosmetic"" can fuck off too. A loot box is a scummy way of making money, and I don't accept them. I did an experiment. I found a website which simulates the real odds of case opening in CSGO. I opened 10 Spectrum cases and got $1.69 worth of skins. I opened $25 worth of cases. That is horrendous. The chance of getting your money back on skins is 3/100 according to my calculations, as I opened 100 cases and got 3 back that just barely make it over the line of being worth more than I paid. I think the highest was $6.03. I play without loot boxes because 1. I actually like the look of the guns without skins and 2. I don't like loot boxes. If you can stand these horrendous odds, open them by all means. But the people among us who know the odds never should.

Overall, I give it a 4/10. It has a lot of potential to be the perfect valve game. But hackers, smurfs, long wait times and loot boxes have ruined it for me.",FALSE
8728,"I like the core game mechanic but it seems like CS:GO is trying as hard as it can to prevent me from playing.

All I have encountered in regular games are smurfs (30 kills or so and zero deaths in the first rank) and obvious aimbots - which somehow aren't caught by VAC, even though the guy was looking down during the whole game and aiming for the head so quickly it's not visible on the kill cam - along with a matchmaking that does everything to fuck with newbies. I can't speak for toxicity in VOIP though, I disabled it after I got my ears blown up by a russian kid shouting at his mic.
I decided to give that battle royale mode a shot, but out of the ~6 tries I've done, 4 times the match didn't start because someone left and the 2 other times I crashed mid game.
Apparently you have to pay to actually get proper matchmaking, or farm for hours in order to even wish to be able to play. I'm not going to review positively a ""free"" game that prevents you from playing if you don't pay...

I might change my review if I actually get to play some day.

8762,"My most played game on Steam.
Many hours played back when this game had a bit more integrity.

Matchmaking was better for competitive, ranks weren't as jacked up,
the R8 hadn't even come out yet, gun sounds were great & spray patterns even better.
Casual was fun & had people joking around & DJ'ing for hours.

A million skins later & we get f2p Counter-Strike with Battle Royale taking over,
having players pay to get into better matchmaking, no new well-balanced maps,
no 128 tickrate servers & no adjustments to vote kicking.

Penalties like having cooldowns for kicking throwers can be a bit ridiculous.
You shouldn't have to decide if you wanna kick someone or not because you could be penalized with a cooldown & not be allowed to play competitively for the game you (originally) paid for. Especially in those moments where you might need to fix something during a comp match so you brb to the main menu & maybe your team wanted to kick someone
and you didn't get a chance to vote. Well congrats, win or lose that match,
you may be greeted at the main menu by being penalized for something you didn't even do.

Guns have had slight adjustments for better or worse, varying from ammo to pricing.
The Negev is still a cheap laser beam you can headshot across the map with,
the MP5 i wanted so bad is decent at best, but not worth replacing.

Casuals on deathmatch seem to act like it's a serious competitive game ready to jump down your throat if you just wanna have fun, seemingly more toxic than ever.
Source engine feels the same as ever if not worse with stuttering & other issues.
It hasn't aged well on CS:GO.

Overall the gameplay isn't bad per se, but i think personally, i may enjoy
1.6/Source more or just stick to custom servers. Being a DMG facing LEMs & SMFC
was fun a long time ago, but in my heart i always was more of an arena shooter/UT player,
too bad those have practically died out a long time ago.

I only get on once in a blue moon out of boredom to see if there's some cool friendly teams for a match or two, but that's it.

- CS GO это когда раскраски оружия стоят дороже крутых игровых девайсов.
- CS GO это когда ты обязан дропнуть свой красивый калаш всей команде.
- CS GO это когда открываешь 20 сундуков и получаешь 20 кусков синего г**на.
- CS GO это когда тебя добавляют школьники и предлагают over 9000 сундуков в обмен на твой нож.
- CS GO это когда тебя добавляет школьник и начинает выпрашивать в подарок шмотку ценой в 3500 рублей, приводя при этом аргумент ""да ты ж богатый, что тебе стоит!"".
- CS GO это когда тебе по 10 раз в день присылают ссылки на трояны в надежде обчистить твой инвентарь.
- CS GO это когда тебя выгоняют только потому что ты Русский.
- CS GO это когда ты спалил свой стул после игры в соревновательном режиме.
- CS GO это когда ""глобалы"" создают по 10 аккаунтов и получают удовлетворение, играя против ""калашей"".
- CS GO это когда ты Russian Noob, если остался против пятерых, убил четверых но не добил пятого.
- CS GO это когда ты Russian Noob при счете 21-7-10, а у ближайшего тиммейта 8-0-16.
- CS GO это когда ты выучил польский и шведский за одну-две катки.
- CS GO это когда в соревновательном режиме поляков больше, чем в самой Польше.
- CS GO это когда ты в одиночку открываешь А, а бомба уже про***на на Б.
- CS GO это когда на твои советы и вопросы тебе отвечают ""stfu Russian"".
- CS GO это когда про***л три звания за день только из-за того, что каждый раз играешь против ""глобалов"", играющих со второго аккаунта.
- CS GO это когда каждый третий тиммейт - набустенный сильвер.
- CS GO это когда против тебя играет пять ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ов с АВП.
- CS GO это когда одного ""беркута"" и четырех ""калашей"" кидает против пяти ""супримов"".
- CS GO это когда высаживаешь все 30 патронов в одного ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥а и наносиишь 99 in 7, а тот рандомным выстрелом попадает тебе в голову.
- CS GO это когда VAC показательно банит профессиональных игроков, но не может забанить ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥а, который простреливает всю команду через три стены, имея при этом 2.2 часа в игре.

Instead of focusing on the player's perspective, Valve decides to release updates such as:

Danger Zone
Operation Shattered Web
Player Skins

Don't get me wrong, these are awesome features, but what good is great features in a dead game? Valve should maybe consider prioritizing getting the hackers of the game instead of making new features.

If you Valve doesn't fix this shit soon, you will have no one to pay for csgo cases, no one to do other in game purchases, and the game will die because Valve couldn't give a rat's ass about the players. There are other companies like ESEA, Faceit, and many others that don't earn nearly as much as Valve does, and has a better banning system. This officially confirms that Valve either doesn't give a shit, or are just lazy.

8924,"Counter Strike: Global Offensive is a very decent game. Although many say they hate it, including me, it's not bad. 

But let me get in-depth as to why it's bad. The playerbase, like many other popular titles, is very, very toxic. You can't get into one match without someone calling you a high-knee faggot shitlord who plays CoD all the time. Complete and utterly ridiculous.

Hackers are way too common. Valve promises the the VAC-system is a scary thing but it's hard to believe when 80% of your matches are primarily populated by hackers. And it's not just, ""They're good players. Stop hating because you're bad"", when you constantly get wallbanged, instantly found in a place no one checks, and you get aced on 14 rounds in a row, that's not being ""bad"".

And last but not least, the game revolves around skins and not the player base. Valve releases cases and skins and in return, receives money and people fall for it everytime. Including the recent update that released graffiti. Instead of just making it free as a comeback from ""Source"" or 1.6, they charge you for it. Valve is just a money-grabbing company. 

TL;DR - Gameplay is good, community and company isn't.",FALSE

8927,"Hello Steam users, Valve, And people planning on purchasing this game. After 200+ hours on record as of 10/14/16, I could not recommend this game AT ALL!

You might be thinking ""Oh you're just a nub get rekt kiddie"", But as someone who enjoys Counter-Strike 1.6 and played extremely competitive I could not enjoy this game 50% of the time. So where did it go wrong? It's very comp savy and will please your need to command a full squad or play with a group of buddies and/or solo it on multi-type of classic maps re-vamped...However you'll find yourself getting upset pretty fast for these few reasons.

1. Hit detection - Absolutly garbage and it's very sad to see such a big game from one of our beloved series having horrible hit detection, there's already multiple videos showing examples of this. In-game personally, I've shot at so many heads while people were camping! And it didn't even kill them! I've been fed up dying when I shot someone perfectly. Most of the time you'll find team-mates up throwing a fit about shooting someone to find out they landed 0 SHOTS! 

2. Run-down community - Don't go Solo-Dolo! And I mean this community is toxic, this is said a million times. Sadly I don't know all the call outs (Since I've literally started playing a little more comp recently making me a target) Either you're called out of your name, people become big babies, and argue with you. And even try team-killing you! So all you can do is report...Which! LEADS TO THE THIRD CONCLUSION

3. 24 hours - 7 days for WHAT?! - 7 Day comp banned...for reporting too much. I've reported even once and recieved one without reporting multi-times. People punished for using the report button...Are you kidding me? Am I the only one seeing this?! I'm trying to help the community by reporting hackers and griefers, yet...I recieve the comp banned? It's very ironic and there are many reasons behind it such as abusive reports. But when you use the report button ONCE, you shouldn't be bannded for 7 days. 

4. Monay Monay Monay! - This game will drain your pockets, from luxury skins to keys, hoping you can profit off of your skins just to recieve a Battle-Scared Blue weapon drop. Personally, I don't buy keys or skins. I just get mines from drops, simple as that. But I find it stupid that the next update is more keys, more cases, and more skins! But not an update fixing these few issues to make the game fun. Instead...They released graffti as a new CS:GO feature! Yay we can now buy graffti! Even though Counter-Strike: 1.6, and Counter-Strike: Source featured FREE, CUSTOMIZABLE, GRAFFTI! But I digress. It's all about the Carti, the Dojah, the Guap, the Mula. As long as you guys feed their pockets who cares about the game! Let's release more color skins to balance out this communites hate!

My final thoughts: Let me actually correct myself, If you're getting CS:GO for free, or for five-dollars and/or less, Go ahead and purchase it. You still can pick from community maps and heck! Maybe you'll have fun and prove me wrong. However I can't recommend this game with all this Bull-shxt going on. If you liked my review, hit that thumbs up like Chris Brown hit Ri-ri...too early still? Damn! Oh well. CS:GO still can be fun...if you can work your ways pass this problem.

8972,"What drew me to this game were the crisp shooting mechanics, they were truly unique and not something you'll find anywhere else. What drove me away was the player base.

Some of you might know that Valve is no longer in the business of making single player games. The last game they made with a real single player campaign was Portal 2, in 2011. CSGO and DOTA2 represent the future of Valve, and CSGO has proven that Valve is completely incompetent at managing their games.

CSGO has multiple game modes; team deathmatch, arms race, demolition and matchmaking in two flavors, casual and competitive. Competitive matchmaking is the meat of the game and is where you will find most of the highly experienced playerbase, and the other game modes were a good place for new players to learn how to play the game. Or at least it used to be.

Many months ago Valve introduced a skill level system that players must rank up through in order to play competitive matchmaking, in an effort to stem off players making new accounts to smurf and cheat on. It worked for about two weeks and has completely saturated all game modes with smurfs, griefers, trolls, hackers and outright idiots trying to level up their accounts and continue in competitive matchmaking, making this game completely unfriendly to new players. If you're new to this game you're going to have your ♥♥♥ handed to you at every venue, and not in a fun way either.

And then Valve decided to add the R8, an absolutely broken revolver that has no purpose in this game, pre or post nerf, and is now the weapon of choice for players who can see through walls.

But that wasn't enough for Valve, they decided to move the competitive matchmaking ranks so their median settled at around gold nova 4, the middle rank in competitive. Fair enough, except to do so they made it easier to derank, players began losing one or two ranks every time they lost. (This author included) Highly skilled players saw this as an opportunity to derank their accounts and make smurfs, undermining Valve's experience point system and making competitive matchmaking a complete nightmare. Oh, and the median rank is somewhere between GN2 and GN3, so now players are using aimbots to get their old ranks back. To make matters worse VAC is completely inadequate and doesn't catch cheaters until months or even years have passed. I swear to God legitimate players are in the minority right now.

If you're interested in this game I say sit back, watch the clown show and either wait for the player base to completely collapse or for Valve to get a clue. If you're completely new to CS stay as far away from this game as you can.",FALSE

8975,"The Smurfs (French: Les Schtroumpfs; Dutch: De Smurfen) is a Belgian comic franchise centered on a fictional colony of small blue human-like creatures who live in mushroom-shaped houses in the forest. The Smurfs was first created and introduced as a series of comic characters by the Belgian comics artist Peyo (pen name of Pierre Culliford) in 1958, where they were known as Les Schtroumpfs. There are more than one hundred Smurf characters, and their names are based on adjectives that emphasize their characteristics, such as ""Jokey Smurf"", who likes to play practical jokes on his fellow smurfs. ""Smurfette"" was the first female Smurf to be introduced in the series. The Smurfs wear Phrygian caps, which came to represent freedom during the modern era.

The word “Smurf” is the original Dutch translation of the French ""Schtroumpf"", which, according to Peyo, is a word invented during a meal with fellow cartoonist André Franquin, when he could not remember the word salt.

The Smurfs franchise began as a comic and expanded into advertising, films, TV series, ice capades, video games, theme parks, and dolls.",FALSE

I used to play CS 1.6 with my friends for LAN parties. When I saw CS:GO, I thought it would be fun to buy and play online.  At first, I was amazed at the beautiful graphics; how much more detail the maps had from 1.6. I had plenty of patience to start with because I knew I wouldn't be the best to start off, so I practiced on casual and then attempted to play competitive. Then my team kicked me and I was banned from comp. After the timer expired, I was banned again for having to leave a match due to overwhelming lag. Then my team kicked me again because my KDR wasn't good enough that one game WHEN I AM A SILVER 2. I have met very few actually helpful and friendly people in this game. I have though met a lot of squeakers, trolls, and pros smurfing. After being banned for 4 weeks straight, I decided that CS:GO is actually an Uninstall Simulator.

VALVE have done nothing to make it easier. I personally think they should add some sort of language/country filter to matchmaking so that people wouldn't have to deal with people that don't speak their language. So if you're thinking of buying this game just for the competitive, it isn't worth buying until matchmaking is out of beta.

Many years ago during Cs 1.6 years i used to love it the concept the mechanics everything was just perfect it was a good thing i had people around me playing the game as well which made it so much better. During the golden 1.6 years the community was really friendly at least the majority you would always have an admin or just a guy who knows the admin playing in the server so you would know that everything is fair. Now before going into CS:GO i thought i will be something similar maybe even better, but i was wrong very wrong. The first few hours i played the game i instantly realized that the skill was not transfered CS:GO is a completely different experience and has it's own mechanics, which i was fine with. Then came the abuse the first time i asked somebody in a server a question about the game i was vote kicked ok i thought maybe because i joined server where everybody wanted to do well so i was not good enough, latyer i found out why people buy a coin so they can complete missions and get items and xp which made sense, but the server was a deathmatch which meant that i've done nothing wrong to be voted off, frankly they should have kept me there for free kills. Then after joining some half empty bot filled servers i started learning and within couple hours my kill death ratio began to even. Then i decided to join a casual dust II server and everything was fine after a couple rounds where i was the last standing i got voted off, no reason again. Then i joined another Dust II server where i was doing all right even won a couple rounds for my team then i swithed to AWP killed a couple people got called a cheater then a noob and got voted off again. Then thinking that this is just me maybe maybe i'm doing something wrong i went to a server and just sticked with my team at all times was rarely alone in the map then got a lucky point bland range headshot with the ssg 08 and got kicked again. So far the only thing i liked about the game was probably the skins and the vote system seems to be too much effective. The whole game seems to ge alright, but the community ruined it for me, even though i could feel that i was geting better by the hours i am not going to play this game. Thanks for reading.",FALSE

9004,"BEST COUNTERSTRIKE GAME EVER, ive played cs: nexon zombies and it was decent, good gameplay and no lag but the problem i had was how bad the graphics were but the zombies in CS: NZ Made up for that though...


As for this i would say i got this and i have been enjoying it since, it takes CS: NZ's Place for the guns, the graphics and the fun, you can go online or just kill bots for achevements when your bored, CS NZ had all of this cept the graphics, but i am loving this even better, still CS: GO Has No zombies, So make that happen and i will still play CS: NZ Till zombies are in CS: GO

9017,"After a long time I tried it again.

The remade sounds are good. The game as a basis is decend though I still dislike the AWP especialy in public mathes as it is at elast as easy to play as the autosniper.

The main problem of this game is the fucked up community. Again especialy on teh public servers. The community servers are pretty  much hidden so the skill cap on those is very decend as most of those guys are vets. On the quickplay servers that are so much propagaded is well lets say I quickly disabled the voice for anyone. Lots of kids destroying any hope of communication. There are no criterias you could chose what kind of game experience you want to have.  There are the classics like team deathmatch or arms race but again no finetuning is possible.

The main problem are the cheaters though. That VAC never did a good job is well known but without any admins on the public servers... oh lord. Its the hell and again public is mutch worse then competitive (until the very high ranks then it gets fucked up compleatly)

9053,"This game shows that you can't put effort in the gameplay only in a competitive game.

It's a different beast from 1.6 and Source but gameplay-wise it's still good nonetheless. Classic mode on casual servers is nice if you wanna goof around but don't expect any real challenge. There's custom maps and gamemods but those are in few servers in the EU and probably won't entertain you for long either.  It also has three other official game modes besides the classic one: Death Match, Arms Race and Demoliton. They're fun but with the exception of Demolition I got bored of them fairly early.
Then there's the competitive mode...

This game got designed, and was advertised as, competitive play oriented. Yet that side is so incredibly bad it's almost comical how it managed to get such a large following. I mean, it's not nearly as balanced as it promotes itself to be, but it does give a kind of fair and enjoyable challenge. It's all that surrounds it the problem.

The community is probably one of the worst you'll meet in MMO, mainly because toxic players (cheaters, trolls, idiots, slavs, you name them) flourish under a management that takes way too long to ban them, IF it bans them. On top of that the server system is screwed up, you have absolutely no way of customize your server search and so you could either end up with a bad ping or a team that doesn't speak a word of english.
The suspension system is even worse: you get suspended for being kicked too much (around 5 times, not even in a row), for kicking too much, for disconnecting for 3 minutes and then some. So if you get in a team of trolls though luck, waste your time for half an hour or disconnect/get kicked and be suspended for a week. If it doesn't seem so bad, be aware that this happens A LOT. At least 1/4 matches will be of that nature, and there's no way to protest or change the outcome.

To sum things up, you got a game that promotes itself as being competitive, that puts its budget in the competitive scene and which gives any kind of challenge in its competitive mode only. Yet said mode is absolute utter crap.

If you want your skills tested, either be content with playing a few times a week or find antother fps. If you want to have fun with CS, install 1.6 or Source.",FALSE

Use all the money you make from skins to update your awful servers, get a real anti cheat system, and balance the guns that are here rather than adding more.. 

Why is it that blizzard cares more about cheaters in overwatch than you do in this game? This one is on tv now. Until the devs take it seriously and make real changes instead of making these dumb sound changes, nobody outside of the current community will take it seriously. 

EDIT: After 3 thousand hours in almost 2 years.  I still dont  recommend this game, another 1k hours shows the exact same thing, AWFUL hit reg, worse than any other fps that iv played. Valve still hasnt made servers base 128tick even know they can clearly affourd it further proving they are just in it for the money now.

They change little things that dont matter to make it look like theyre still updating when in reality they know that people will flock to it wheather or not it gets better, the fans will always defend it bashing any other game. Awps still requre half of my grenades to even challenge them, t9 is still spammable, running/jumping and shooting is still going to reign because their servers cant register people moving. 

This may sound like im salty, but thats because im upset. iv poured 3k hours into this game only to get worse? People play like silvers and they kill me, then talk shit as if theyre the best in the game.

Very sad day. ill keep playing casually but nothing like i used to.

2. is my ping gonna be high or low
3. is my opponents ping gonna be high or low ( this matters alot casue the lag compensation sucks, it seems the low pingers are penalised vs high pingers more often than not)
4. is there gonna be a hacker or a smurf in my game ( there is a abundance of these all over the place which ruins the gaming experience for all).
5. is my bullets gonna register in this server or is my AK gonna do 12 damage again when i shoot his head or is the bullets gonna magically go through the model and nothing will happen :S this happens alot and if its never happened to u then youre one in a million.
6. the games full of bugs even after 3 years ! which bug is gonna be a nuisance today ??

my conclusion: steer clear of competetive matches anbd 64 tick servers if your goal is to be a competitive player
rather strictly play 128 tick servers to get the best possible experience and also join alt pug and esea qhich offer a much better anti cheat system and get not even an iota of profit as valve do offering the lessser services.

the movement is broken the hitboxes are broken and the registry just damn sucks atm

Today i played 3 matchmaking, every match has one or more cheater/s :S

I watched back the matches, im sure they hacking: aiming throught the wall before kill you, follow your movement trought wall, shooting 2boxes left and headshot you with bizon etc.

I dont understand, why not able the VALVe make a EFFECTIVE anticheat program. Im qualified in programming and i know its hard to implement this kind of program, but its not impossible. scan memory, use heuristic and hashcheck, watch memory pointers, communication and other programs behavior.

Im very dissapointed and upset, in the last 2 weeks there was sooo many cheaters in this game that never before!

I have to watch a full cheater (spinning aim etc) overwatch, why dont you VAC him instant??? 
Analysing his behaviour and instant VAC in the 3./4. round thats all!
Shooting(aiming) miles away from the guys head, and headshot him. OK first luck, second luck, third VAC-ban bye! 
thats how anticheat should work. Wallhacking and smaller aim/toggle aim are harder to detect with algorithm, i accept that. It need a human to watch it, but i think you can detect the ON/OF key in the keyboard (before he shoot hs press X button and next also etc.)

So you should consider build in a ""behavior watcher"" anticheat program / AI which will watch every player behavior

For very few moments of enjoyment I had in this game, the majority of the experience was toxic. The only good thing that came out of this game was a few laughs I had with my friends and I even met some awesome lads from Florida. Other than that, I wish I never paid money for this game. My experience was overall negative, but the refund policy here is 2 hours.

If you want a very competitive video-game, you will get it. Along with it, you will encounter an immature community with anger management issues. On top of that, get ready for a fashion show of who has prettier pixels on their gun (and now gloves). I've witnessed the child gambling scandal with their in-game cases, and all I can say is I'm disappointed.

I watched this game bring out the worst side of my friends. I've witnessed them filled with rage, frustration and hate. That negative energy was not only destructive for them, but it was also painful for me to watch. It wasn't the regular frustration you'd get from any other competitive shooter, this was something else. It felt personal.

I sincerely hope other people only experienced genuine enjoyment from this game and its community. Perhaps I was unlucky to hit all the bumps of this game, and my view of the game isn't representative of the majority. I don't know, and I don't care to find out. I felt relieved after distancing myself from this game, and I don't plan on changing that.

9149,"CS GO
Jogabilidade: Regular
Gráficos: Bom
Segurança (VAC): Ruim
Som: Regular
Interação: Pessima

Média do jogo: Ruim

- Jogabilidade (Modo Competitivo): Os jogadores usam hackers, cheaters dentre outros meios de se beneficiar, a Valve sabe disso e nao faz nada a respeito, Inuria é o hacker mais conhecido 80 R$ por mês. (Modo Casual,Deathmatch e outros) Bem divertido pra descontrair, desde que tome cuidado com os jogadores que sempre querem ser os melhores e ficam rushando sem nenhum conceito de jogabilidade e senso de trabalho em equipe.

-Interação: Você é expulso das partidas se não souber jogar o jogo, todos que te matam, humilham você, são preconceituoso, não tem educação necessária para respeitar outros jogadores, principalmente os brasileiros, são os piores jogadores de CS ou qualquer jogo online, só sabem chingar e falar mal dos outros, não respeitam ninguém e são quase todos prepotentes, inexperientes e sem nenhum senso de jogabilidade.

-Gráficos: Source 2 Graphic Engine, leve, sem muitos bugs, rodará sem nenhum problema nos computadores mais básicos, verificar requisitos abaixo.

-Segurança: Provavelmente um dos piores ant cheaters que ja foram criados é o VAC, decadente, é ridiculo como uma empresa tão grande e tão poderosa financeiramente não consegue impedir o uso de cheaters em seus games.

-Som: Boa qualidade de audio ambiental, com um bom equipamento pode-se ouvir o inimigo distante, até usando a luneta dos rifles snipers, péssima recepção do som das armas, quem procurar um simulador de tiro FPS não espere muito de CS GO, pois o som dos disparos é deprimente.

Quem quiser se aventurar mais em um bom jogo de tiro recomendo Insurgency [insurgent]

As someone who has decided to take the game serious i quickly found that my skill level was no where near what it had to be to play at a higher level. the problem is that the in game mach-making system is full of cheaters and smurfs making it hard for someone to get consistent skill level to learn the game better. Plus the comunity is terrible at welcoming a newer player and showing them the ropes! so after youve gotten fed up with the in game MM you hear about a few third party based MM systems.

And after they made ranked and unranked mode which is basically you need to buy prime status for 15€.
At the first moment cheaters disappeared but after getting LE my trustfactor was fine and the number of cheaters have outnumbered legit players. And it puts me with cool and really talkative players who mainly play faceit and againt full on lagging enemies who will shoot you after the 1pixelpeek and obviously through walls(keep in mind that before the fixed trustfactor it used to put me against other cheaters where we had a chance to win). And this is not only happening to me but to the majority of people. And they admit to having cheated against clean players snd overwatch is just down for some reason.

9190,"From a technical standpoint, probably one of the best FPS games ever developed. Controls are smooth, options are thorough, gameplay is tight, solid 120 tickrate servers for competitive, no real lag advantages that I've seen. Can't change your FOV at all though, which means I can't play this game very much even if I wanted to.

From a gameplay standpoint, falls into the same hole Dota 2 falls into. Memorize everything and you might just have fun. Hell, you even have to memorize where your bullets travel because the crosshair is worthless; isn't that great? Learn the maps, learn the callouts, learn where people liek to hide, learn how your gun works. Spend hours mindlessly memorizing everything until you're just good enough to get put against a team of russians that mop the floor with you; or a team of smurf global elites in the silver bracket.

If you want to play this game just to try it, and you're new, and you have any kind of shooter experience in the past, use the pistols almost exclusively at first. My first 3 matches I tried every gun in the game and failed to hit anything I was aiming at; then on my fourth I wound up having to go pistol only (dying too much from one taps) and aced 2 rounds with just the base pistol as my primary.

In summary: If you're looking for a tactical shooter, buy Rainbow 6 Seige. This game is probably the least dynamic ""tactical shooter"" I've ever played. The only real strategizing you can do is positioning; which, for someone who enjoys strategy games significnatly more than shooters, I find really boring.

Ezzel nem is lenne semmi gond, a probléma ott kezdődik, hogy ennek a bevonzott játékos tábornak az átlag életkora alulról súrolja a 12-t. Nem tudom, hogy velem van-e a baj, de én nem szeretem amikor egy alapvetően csapatmunkára építkező játékban, az emberek, egymástól teljesen függetlenül rohangálnak szerte-szét a pályán, teljesen ignorálva a tanácsokat és utasításokat. Amikor a Minecraftból szabadult, elkényeztetett, agyhalott kinderkommandó minden egyes tagja végígment anyámon, ott már úgy érzem, ez a játék nem jó úton halad. Régen büszke voltam rá, hogy CS játékos vagyok, most pedig lépten-nyomom próbálom letagadni, hogy valaha is volt bármilyen közöm ehhez a játékhoz, és a közösségéhez.

                  Well, gentlemen. The day has come. This will be the official day when CS:GO has completely died because of developers ignorance regarding community and community requests. They had all feedback they needed and they just threw it into the far box. I've played quite a while in this game, I enjoyed it. I remember the first day I bought it, I was so excited to play it. And I was playing and playing, playing and playing. But unfortunately the game was becoming worse and worse with each update developers were bringing into the game. Instead of an actual game fixes, small token fixes and main focus on skins, crates, ""dead trends"". As someone who was supporting Counter Strike game series for quite a while as well as CS:GO, I can't tell more than I am majorly disappointed. The last update is no more than an attempt to follow ***trends*** Imho. Now since CS:GO is free, there is no gates such as price to stop hackers. Now everyone can buy prime status that was unlockable only when you reach 21st level. And the only award they gave to people that were loyal to the game for a really long time is just some token. I am nothing more than disappointed and heartbroken. Seeing developers hitting their own creation (abomination seems to be more appropriate due recent events Imho.) really breaks my heart. The way of developers thinking is quite obvious now, as well as their course for this game. I strongly do not recommend this game.

9269,"Okay let's get this out of the way... CS:GO is quite possibly the greatest FPS of all time. It's realistic, it is fun, the controls are super tight, the graphics are great, and the overall mechanics of the game are outstanding!

So why am I giving this a negative review?

That's because the game's community and security are total crap.
The community is filled to the brim with rude and straight up toxic people. If you don't do so hot in one game your comrades will make sure that you know full well with the most vile language that you have ever heard. Not to mention, if you are not god tier, you will not be treated with an ounce of respect. Almost everyone is obsessed with competitive and if you are not ranked in at least gold, you are the equivalent to dog feces on the bottom of their shoe. It makes it absolutely impossible to try to enjoy the game casually or competitively.

And then there's the god awful matchmaking. This may quite possibly be the worst matchmaking system in competitive play that I have ever seen. When you are starting out in competitive there is no pity for the trash that is unranked scum. You are not even matched with silvers or any other unranked players, you will be thrown right into the jaws of gold, gold novas, or even eagles. Skill based matchmaking in competitive is non-existent. Not to mention, you are not worth competitive players' time if you do not have the amount of play tme that they expect of you. If you are having a good game in competitive play, but you only have 100 hours in total playtime, you will be grilled. There is no avoiding it.

This game also has a serious hacker problem. Valve says that these servers are V.A.C. protected and that is by far the funniest joke that has ever been made by them. I have often been put into games where I have been sniped by an AK-47 the moment everyone is released, there was a person flying around and getting instant headsots with a glock, and was matched up with people who were straight up invincible and this was in competitive mode. This is NOT okay. 

Overall if you want to compose a team of your friends and go online this will be one of the greatest multiplayer experiences you will ever have the priviledge of playing on. The gameplay is just so marvelously good and when playing with the right people, you will have the time of your life. However, if you play by yourself in matchmaking, chances are you will find it hard to enjoy yourself.

What does it offer you may ask?

Well we got the horrid ranking system that wont rank you up even if you have a long lasting winstreak (5+) with constant 3-4 mvps every game.

In addition to the horrid ranking system you get the most miserable and mentally handicapped teammates that you can think of, being high/drunk while the enemy team is full party LEM smurf team that spends minimum of 13 hours a day warming up for a single game and has 3k+ hours on every smurf account. Ah and how can i forget the 14 year old cringe teenagers who wasted 15$ just to blatantly cheat on a prime account and say ""mad cuz bad"" ""im legit"" ""im smurfing"" while giving harder one taps than scream in his prime.

If you played other shooters like cod or battlefield when you hear the word recoil you probably think of just moving you mouse a bit down while here you need to learn a specific spray pattern that is unique to every weapon and to master few of 34 sprays you'll need at least few hundred hours.

I forgot to tell you about the most torturing moments you'll experience while trying to kill an enemy, you can see that your crosshair is perfectly alined with the head of your opponent, you're not moving at all, you fire at the perfect time yet the server just dosent feel like reading that and just ignores the hit then the enemy does a 360 no scope and fucking shits on you while you're starring at your screen shocked and screaming to your teammates that you fs hit. You might say that its cuz of my ping being 2 billion but no i was playing at a pretty low 40-50 ping, does valve expect me to sit and live on the server to be allowed to kill an enemy? Yes you can try faceit, where you'll meet the mostly normal part of players, better servers and anti cheat, HOWEVER the players that you're going to go against are a lot better than your usual mm opponents, at least your team is gonna be aight, but you'll probably get shit on again and the whole commands that you have to put into the chat when the game starts and during the game might be a bit too much a new faceit player (i only played like 2-3 games so i cant really be talking much about faceit)

Oh yea and another big thing is how people develop a gambling addiction which thank God i dont have but a lot of people have gotten thru this game, theres a thing called cases each case with the key costs about 3$ on average and the odds of you getting an item that they will profit from is fucking so low that people have tried opening 12k cases and only got 25 knives (they didnt profit at all), but since all of youtube is filled with thousands of vids of people getting knives and stuff everyone wants to try their luck and open one yet they fail on the first try so they do more and more.

I can still go on a lot about how bad this horrid game is, but please dont play it if you want to save your nerves and hours please dont even consider downloading this pile of shit, go read a book, go to the gym, get a job, get a gf, do whatever you want but dont fucking touch this game. Sadly there are people who cant be helped, they are already in their late 20s or even 30s but still play this every day they live from paycheck to paycheck not enjoying the life at all, all their friends are virtual and the only thing connecting them is the same addiction to this game, they dont go out they dont talk or visit their family members at all and have spent most of their lives playing this shit yet saying every game they lose ""im deleting cs"" ""im so done with this game"" then the next day you see them playing again and again, its a never ending loop. If you have more than 2k hours in this or any game please reconsider yours actions, think about all the things you could have achieved, how many languages you could have been already fluent in or how much money you could have made but instead of all that you're stuck playing a 10 year old game that has a horrid community, horrid servers, horrid anti-cheat. Please wake up, a game is not worth spending hundreds of hours just to prove to some random people on the internet that you wont ever meet in your life that you're better at a fucking pixel aim and shooting game. Games are nice, they are an amazing way to chill but games like this that require the user to master every single aspect of it just to be considered above average are not worth the time spent at all. Once again, please do something more productive that just sit in front of your pc clicking pixels and typing ""shit on"" ""get good"". 

At the end all i have to say that say i did have some moments where i truly enjoyed this game but all the stress, rage were not worth those moments, yes i did have a laugh here and there, had some fun time with friends. Just dont get yourself into this rabbit hole of endless aim, spray, smoke, flash practice just to be stuck with braindead teammates, there are tons of other amazing games that you can play, but just please dont play this shit. 

Thank you for reading this long ass shit and for your time.

9306,"There are many players who were hacking in this game. Valve couldn't do much to prevent it since C.S. first released.

As for the community, while some players just want to stay around to learn about the game or just tagging along for fun, if they don't perform well, most of the time someone would vote kicking. So it doesn't offer much chances for people to learn. If you lose, you'll always lose. And you will lose even more because you don't get to learn. You won't even be able to stay in the game because of the kicking. 

To sum it up, the game is ruined by the majority of rage players and hackers.

Valorant: 
120hz tick rate.
Ground-up focus on killing peeker's advantage.
Ground-up focus on anticheat.
Anti-toxicity foundation. 
Angle focused gunplay.
Utility focused character abilities. 
Riot Games.

CS:GO:
32hz tick rate. 
10 years old. 
Racism and toxicity running rampant for 10 years. 
Angle focused gunplay. Suffers from traditional peeker's advantage and filled with hackers in and out of Prime.

9328,"From my own point of view I find this game can be fun at times and addictive, however there are many factors that degrade the fun value of a game like this.
Hackers and smurfs run rampant which ruins a lot of the playability. Sometimes it can however cause people to want to improve their own skills, but I find that a lot of the time people lose the will to play when they face either of these.
One thing that bothers me most of all is the ranking system. The way it is now is based on wins more than anything, which doesnt exactly value your own skill level, since winning a match is more of a team effort than solo plays. 
If Valve were to change the ranking system to be based off of a persons individual skills, based on accuracy, kills, deaths, points, assists, etc. Then it would give you a better idea of that persons skill level, and putting that person with others of their skill level for a match would produce a lot better results than the current system. It would also discourage smurfs and hackers as well, since their stats would affect the ranks and the players they are put with.
I cant recommend this game because of the lack of effort that is put into weeding out hackers and smurfs. The community run overwatch helps a great deal, but its not preventing the hacking in the first place, and it wont change the ranks people lose when faced against these kinds of people.

Update: 05/08/2015

A lot of the times the matchmaking system can make mistakes. But some things you just cant avoid. I find that a lot of people that play CSGO dont understand the fact that this is a team game. Today we played a competitive, the other team had at least one hacker, and our team had 2 people griefing. They were throwing the bomb away, flashbanging us on purpose, standing in our line of sight, just because they wanted to lose the match. They wanted to derank themselves. Which is another problem that comes with smurf accounts. Once they get a rank they need to lower it, so they lose games on purpose, bringing the whole team down with them.",FALSE

Then i just recieved my fourth 7 day ban in a row after 2 hours of being unanned because my immature pre-teen teamates kicked me for not clutching a one versus four situation. They call it clutch or kick because they think they are cool because they saw it on youtube. So I am on another ban for being kicked too many times. Unless you are very good at this game or are an immature jerk, this game probably will be ruined for you as it is for me. I wish I could play, but I just don't have fun anymore.",FALSE

I think that's inconvenient and very cruel to just people who came home after hard working day at the office and just want to chill out, but nope instead we face the wall of greedy salty people who's most likely being pounded like a christmas chicken at their main accounts or ranks, and overall pathetic people so they decide to go and smuf on a lower ranks.
That's what turns most of the new people off this game, the same story goes on and on but why would valve give a certain fuck about that if new accounts equals more money spent, that's cruel and inconvenient, more likely a failed community management system or its non existence.
