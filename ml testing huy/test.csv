15104,"Long review below:

I do recommend this game. It is quite extensive, pleasant to play, quite nice if you want to just relax. There are numerous pros and very little cons, which I will list below. First of all, I need to say this is my first FH series game and I am impressed. 

Pros:
- The world is amazing. It is big, with excellent detail, there are all sorts of roads, with different grip, etc. 
- Changing seasons is a nice feature. While Autumn and Spring are pretty much the same, Winter is just amazing. Having a dirt race on snow is simply great. 
- Humongous amount of cars. I've never seen another game with so many cars in it. There are 752 cars... Just amazing. You can go for an old classical car, a nice rally car from the 70s or 80s, any well known 90s car, or a large amount of cars afterwards. Its as you please. Not to mention how many classes there are - rally cars, track race, gt, supercars, hypercars, trucks, buggies, suvs, I'm sure I'm missing a lot others.
- Auction House - this is an absolutely brilliant feature. You can buy cars from other players. They can be listed for bidding at a low amount and a purchase price at a higher. I got 99% of my cars that way. You can either buy or sell your cars that way. 
- Race types. As there are a lot of types of cars, there are also a lot of types of races. My favorites are off-road either with rally cars or trucks. 
- Also about races, this is not the regular 10-hour gameplay game. I have played for 35 hours so far and am not sure if I have reached the 50% yet. Most probably not. 
- Events - those are nice, based on the season, where you need to comply with specific requirements to gain rewards. 
- In-game achievements. Well, not exactly achievements, but there are those nice zones, where you need to get to a certain completion in order to get 1,2 or 3 stars. For example in speed traps, you need to pass through a speed camera with a certain speed. Or there are jumps from which you jump and need to achieve a specific fly distance. I was thinking initially that those are made just for the fastest cars, as most of the starting ones were on normal roads. But no, you can have some which are on dirt and supercars simply cannot accelerate that much on that surface. 
- I am sure there is a huge amount of other Pros, but let's not make this review waaaay to long.

Cons:
- Menus are quite difficult at start. It takes some time to learn to navigate them.
- While music should be listed as a plus, as there are several radios providing all sorts of music styles (including classical), the songs are too limited and at a certain time become a nuisance. 
- Bugs. While there are not many, there are some bugs from time to time, which are a bit unpleasant. I mean this is a Microsoft game and it is normal to have bugs. 
- Speaking of Microsoft, one of the main issues I got was that the Auction House became greyed-out. According to everything I read, you need to fill your age (which I had already) and ensure all options in your Xbox account are enabled (for whatever reason). So it took me about 2 days of troubleshooting to fix this myself as the support was not really helpful. 

Hope this helps.",1

15111,"I think Forza Horizon 5 looks better, plays better, has better AI and UI, and the map is also more fun to drive around in, however Forza Horizon 4 is still an amazing racing experience as someone who's just a big fan of car collections and racing games. I played this game for a long while back in like, idk, mid last year? maybe early last year? when I first signed up for game pass. and it was fun but I just like owning games better there's just something so empty-feeling about playing games on a subscription service this game genuinely feels better to play after buying it now
less guilty about the progress I've made you know. though you could argue that that's just sunk cost fallacy stuff
anyway it's a good game. if you like forza horizon at all why not get this. if you like cars and collections and somewhat arcadey driving with tons of difficulty and accessibility options why not play this!
It is pretty expensive but it goes on less for sale than 5 does at the moment AND it does have the lego expansion which is pretty fun (what 5's expansions will be I don't yet know though I hope it's as good as LEGO stuff or better)
not a must play but it definitely does what I wanted it to for me",1

i don't know what's the problem i am very sure it's not on my end since i have solid hardware to run it and it's the only game that does this , so that's why it doesn't deserves the recommendations .... non stop game crashes just ruins everything and makes it unplayable .",0

There's lots to do and the game is very good value for money considering how much time the average player will spend playing FH4. I like this game a lot.
Only gripe I have is I wish you could disable damage to your car. I don't like looking through a cracked windscreen.
Should you buy this instead of or as well as FH5. Yes definitely. You need the whole Forza collection and this game will hold up for a long, long time.",1

15318,100% honest review here and I don't normally write reviews for games I dislike. i really really wanted to like Forza Horizon 4. it looks pretty and the cars look amazing but the game play feels so bad i cant stand more then 5 minutes of trying a race. i've tried to tune my steering wheel to make everything not feel chunky and it doesn't help. I make one little mistake and i'm doing doughnuts and the whole race is over and gone. maybe i'm just bad i don't know. I can play other race games just fine. i haven't even gotten into the multiple crashes into about 30 min of playing the game. i don't understand what is causing this. I turn down graphics and still crash. id honestly give this game another try if i could play longer but with all the cards pulling against me and i cant. I regret getting the higher priced version and not trying it out before i could return it. i don't foresee them fixing any of the issues since Forza Horizon 5 is out now. i don't understand why they are both $60 this game feels like a $35 maybe even a $25 now. In sort i would not recommend spending your money on this crap game with beautiful cars.,0

This game is Just what I expected for my money. 

Story:
Who cares, its a racing game. You get Top Gear missions though. 

Graphics: 
Amazing and immersive. I played everything on high with 120hz setting, not ultra which is the max.

Gameplay:
Great variety of cars and most of them feel unique, compared to each other. Cool races and I like the different options. 

Reviewing this game early, playtime wise, but I can see 5 hours in, you can play this game for hundred of hours, if you like it very much. Did not buy any DLC, but that looks really cool as well. Going to check out Horizon 5 also, next time its on 50% off, I guess. 

I played this game with a DualSense5 controller, and everything was really responsive.

15461,"I initially purchased the ultimate edition of this game after enjoying the Forza Motorsport series for many years. I entered this game with the understanding that it's open world and more arcadey. I was sorely disappointed to find the car purchasing system is entirely obsolete with the myriad of free cars from all the nonsense ""DLC."" There is no working your way through car classes. In fact, every race you show up for you are given the freedom to create the race entirely, class and car type, whatever you want. Directionless nonsense that completely removes the enticement of modding or tuning a car for better performance. Money is meaningless and there is no scale of cost vs. performance. Want a brand new corvette Z06? that'll be 8,000 Cr. Want a new Corvette Stingray? Arbitrarily 1,000,000 Cr. 

lets talk about seasons, because they pass in the blink of an eye. I started the game with the knowledge of this festival. Played the tutorial season and started the next one. 3 Races later I was in the next season! What? Where was the event? A few more races and it happened again. And the content generated by other players? You're stuck with all that nonsense too. Challenges formulated  by other players either happen in one of two ways, they are designed to not allow you to succeed or you complete a 1Hr race in 2 hr 33 sec....

- graphics are great,
- there is a ton of cars to choose from (more than any game i have played),
- livery editor allows you to customize your car paint however you want,
- driving feels good.

Things this game doesn't get quite right:
- AI is unimpresive and likes to ruberband,
- all AI races feel pretty much the same (gamemode variation is next to none),
- there is no story at all,
- mentioned livery editor lacks basic features (like undo),
- body kit options (spoilers, splitters...) are very limited (compared to decades old games like NFSU2),
- soundtrack is pretty lame,
-most car unlocks are tied to an RNG wheel spin (you will get plenty of them, but this still ruins any sense of 
 progression. If you are lucky you might get a car you want right away, if you are not you may never get it);

If you plan to play this game with a raceing wheel you can, but force feedback is pretty bad.
Overall this game is not bad, but far from perfect as it lacks some features even much older games had. If you are going to play it, play with friends.",1

15674,"I initially got Forza Horizon 5; the benchmark race ran fine but the game did not load because of a memory access exception. So I decided to try the Previous Version. It didn't seem to look all that different from the new game.

Forza Horizon 4 is the best racing game that I've ever played. I am familiar with racing-serious games like Need For Speed and Gran Turismo. Forza Horizon 4 feels good. The cars feel heavy as they should, and the physics is as real as it can be with 'fun' as a factor in gameplay. 

I'm playing Civilization 6 and Disco Elysium, and I thought this game would be a great break for my Left Hemisphere. I let my Left hand manage 5 keys and it's all Muscle Memory once you get the hang of it in a few hours. It isn't some guilty pleasure game either. The mechanics is very sophisticated and the handling of your machine is a matter of razor-sharp timing and instinct-driven road negotiation. 

There are several annoying things about this game though. To start with, the good awful music makes driving a cringe-cruise. You can turn down the Radio to [1] and fire up Winamp feat Prodigy to address that. The characters are of funny design as well. You get to pick among a small pickle of protagonists who are supposed to represent the 'typical' gamer: lean, boring, 'jeans and t-shirt' wearing youths with social inadequacies. Some of the NPCs in the game, who I think might be professional racers, have better body frames, presence, and less social awkwardness. Reminder: You are just a Gamer and not a Racer. 

But hey, Forza 4 is set in Britain, so it's not like we're looking for high standards or substance. There is a great deal of Cheesing that happens in the game. Sometimes your vehicle just smothers out of control as though it is possessed by some wannabe Phallic-God programmer. This happens during every race that matters. The [R]ewind feature, when it's available that is, addresses some of the cheese with 'let's navigate around the Game Master with Time Travel'. 

All in all, the game is worth every penny or so of the 20$ I invested in it. Get serious with Civilization 6 and Disco Elysium; let go with Forza! Enjoy the company of the Bristol-pack and stale beer.",1

15766,"I bought the Ultimate package of this game on 50% sale, hoping I would be able to run and enjoy it on my HP ProDesk. Long story short, I now very much enjoy Forza Horizon 4, but 8 GB of RAM wasn't enough and it took an extra RAM purchase after 70 hours of play to finally cancel out all the stuttering. 

Of course, only NOW have some people told me that the additional 32 GB was overkill... I think I'll leave it in.

=========================================

EDIT: I just ran into a separate issue of ""low streaming bandwidth,"" where during short races of exceptionally high speed (around 300 MPH if I read correctly), the road textures failed to draw on time and my car would stop immediately as though it had hit a brick wall. Then I could resume driving, but of course any timed challenges would fail because of the interruption. I eventually found a sort of partial workaround for all those short Super7 speed challenges: as soon as the challenge started (when I could begin driving), I would go into Photo Mode and take my time taking in-game photographs of the car from the NW/NE/SE/SW positions, and when I was done I could keep driving without interruption because all the required textures had loaded! Better than nothing, I guess.

EDIT 2: Or you can simply rewind your progress, if your challenge allows this, although do note that some do not!

EDIT 3: I’ve recently suffered the third partial wipeout of my save game. All my unshared liveries and most of my garage thumbnails are GONE! The progress, the money, the cars and their upgrades are intact, and I can still download my shared liveries from my Creative Hub, but it’s still a major PITA to have lost all those precious hours. 

So why, oh why do I continue to suffer these terrible faults? I think it’s because… I'm addicted. I suppose the game is like a hot girlfriend that keeps cheating and stealing and dissing and ghosting and ranting... but the quality time she spends happy with you is unmatched by anything else in the world. :-P",1

15790,"Considering it doesn't need a monster PC to run this, it is AWESOME and visually beautiful.
Gameplay is arcady - I wouldn't recommend a steering wheel for this.  A good gamepad with analogue sticks will do.
The story is simple, open world, race race race with a vast range of cars to choose from - something to suit everyone from muscle classics, supercars, 4x4s, SUVs and even a transit van!

Still very pricey tho when I purchased it but if like me you don't have an Xbox and miss the days of Forza when you used to have the X360, this is one for you.

The game doesn't care if you drive your Zonda through fences, trees, or across a river, it just keeps rewarding you and cheering you on. It's even fun to just put on some music, and drive a hatchback at normal speeds across the world. Not to mention there's seemingly thousands of tasks to complete, and almost a thousand cars to acquire. I'm 30 hours in but it's going to take a lot more to see this whole game. 10/10 great value, excellent driving.",1

I played 20 hours of the game, qualified for the Horizion Team, and then boom. Haven't played in weeks. I think this game has a bit of a curve, but once you get past that bordem curve, it should be back in action. But until then, I think this game is a 7/10 for me.",1

16017,"I’ve always had a soft spot for British cities, towns, villages and countryside. As someone who is a fan of open-world games, and enjoys an arcade racing game now and then, I definitely find Forza Horizon 4 an appealing title. It’s set in a highly condensed, simplified version of central and northern Great Britain that includes Edinburgh, the Scottish Highlands, the Lake District, Ambleside, Broadway, and Bamburgh. This picturesque, yet uncommon, setting for an open-world game, makes FH4 even more special.

Although Forza Horizon 5 was released past November, FH4 is still a relevant game. At the time of this review, the FH4 community is still quite active, with at least 20 players -- sometimes as many as 50 -- online in my sessions. With all additional official content for FH4 having been released, you’ll know exactly what you’ll get when you buy this game. When it comes down to it, your preference in scenery will be the major determining factor in deciding between FH4 and FH5.

FH4 is a playground with plenty of game modes to unlock and access. Aside from an impressive tutorial that guides you through various types of races, terrains, seasons, and weather conditions in the first several minutes, you pretty much have free reins on your driving adventure from the start. The action in FH4 centres on:
story-based challenges called Horizon Stories, with The Stunt Driver and British Racing Green being my favourites;
races (Road, Dirt, Street, Cross Country, and Showcase), with racing/chasing a train in a 1959 Ford Anglia like in Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets being most memorable;
PR stunts (speed traps and zones, stunt jumps, drifting zones); and
events (live in-game challenges titled Forzathon Live, as well as daily and weekly challenges).

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2684469342

There is also a battle royale mode called The Eliminator, as well as a series of user-created challenges named Super7. Mechanically inclined players can also tune their vehicles, artistic ones can design liveries for their cars, construction oriented folks can devise new racing routes, and shutterbugs can capture their favourite cars at eye-catching moments using the in-game camera mode. All can share their creations with the FH4 community to enjoy. FH4 has something for everybody regardless of your levels of enthusiasm and skill for driving and racing games. It even offers to adjust the difficulty level based on your recent racing performances.

If you wish, you can simply explore the over 300 roads on the map. I spent my first 30 hours or so mainly doing that, plus triggering speed traps and zones, doing stunt jumps, destroying smashable signs, and seeking and photographing as many of the over 700 featured cars as I could. I’ve truly enjoyed the freedom with which I had just exploring the in-game world by car, without ever worrying about the police, griefers, and dying. This is something that even Grand Theft Auto couldn’t offer.

If that’s not enough, there are the expansion packs: Fortune Island and LEGO Speed Champions. The former transports you to a mountainous island with sheer cliffs and extreme weather, and the latter to the joyful LEGO Valley, where structures are made of LEGO bricks. If you enjoy driving or racing games with challenging terrain and treasure hunting, I think you’ll enjoy Fortune Island. I recommend LEGO Speed Champions to all because it’s just so whimsical and delightful to see LEGO vehicles go toe-to-toe against real cars.

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2703143656

FH4 employs tricks like endowed progress effect, artificial scarcity, randomized reward, and leaderboards to make gameplay addictive. You’re awarded Skill or Influence Points for almost everything you do. Skill Points convert to Perks for your cars, and Influence Points unlock new races, events and prizes. Winning races and completing events will earn you Credits, which you use to buy new cars and houses. At times, you’ll get the chance to win (rare) prizes in Wheelspins. With these reward systems in place, FH4 is more fun and addictive than I had initially imagined.

Don’t want to wait to win or buy a specific car? You can see if one of the several DLC car packs has it. I decided to buy Forza Horizon 4: Ultimate Edition mainly because I wanted the LEGO Speed Champions expansion pack and the Best of Bond Car pack. I don’t regret my decision, for this is the closest I’ll ever get to driving cross Britain in a 1964 Aston Martin DB5, even though it doesn’t come with Q’s enhancements.

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2684410944

What keeps FH4 interesting and dynamic after all these hours is that the game changes season every real-time week. Each season comes new events and challenges, such as being able to drag race on a frozen lake in winter. If anything, FH4 has so much content that the game’s menu and map can get overwhelming, and disorienting. It’s one of the game’s few shortcomings. The other is the absence of a custom radio station, which is a real shame since I’d love to play soundtrack from James Bond films as I trek across the land in the DB5.

Playing FH4 has been an entertaining way to bid 2021 farewell, and welcome 2022. At the time of this review, I’ve clocked in just under 80 hours of playing time, and I foresee putting in many more in the weeks to come. Needless to say, I highly recommend this game to anyone who enjoys open-world games and arcade racing games. While the Ultimate Edition may not be for you, I think the base game and at least a couple of the DLCs are worth checking out.",1

Don't get me wrong the game is rely enjoyable but the auto-save system is terrible. The game is suppose to save automatically all your progress but i do not work. When they do an update you roll back on your previous save so be prepare for the 'Special snow event' around Christmas when you lose a big chunk of your progress but look it has snow in the game now!

I try contacting Microsoft on that and they just close my ticket saying that they can restore an old save or a corup one. Basically, they cannot do anything. If they could just incorporate a regular save button in game it will save a lot of headache.",1

16089,"This game saved my life.

I am 38.

My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and adopted our son together. They are now both 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I found myself lost and miserable. I was self destructive. I got so mad one day from everything spiraling out of my control that I punched some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion. That caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand... my working hand... my games hand.. the hand that I held and carried my children to bed with.. The hand I desperately needed to make sure I could continue to provide.

After learning of the severity of my self-inflicted damage, I was borderline suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety. I have never had fits of rage, or been one to break down and cry, but I was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side.

Having nothing better to do, I searched for a game I could play, ONE HANDED while I recovered. I somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews. I decided that it had to be worth a shot... I must admit, I didn't beat the game, or play nearly as long as some of you. In fact, I may have only played this game a day or two.. With that being said, after doing so, I had a new found joy and hope for life. I was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me. I was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness. I was able to see the fruits of my ""labor"". I relaxed for 5 :hillary: :hillary: :hillary: :hillary: :hillary: :hillary: :hillary: minutes to this music long enough to realize that I was going to be okay.
After coming to that realization, I turned the game off, and I went back to work. It hurt my hand like hell but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself, and I became the father I needed to be in that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving as.

Today, I am close friend with my kids mother. We don't fight, or argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents, and friends.

I now have 3 kids. My third child is, wait for it, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my own separation, and we just stumbled in to each others life unexpectedly. We have been in a relationship for a year now, and are very happy together.

Moral of the story, you never know what life holds in store for you, and if I would have given up when all the odds were stacked against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

Thank you",1

16134,"The game looks good and runs well.

The cars are beautiful, the simulation of the behaviour of the different cars is really surprising,  and the number of cars is huge. So huge, that I am badly missing some organisation means for it like 'garage1' and 'garage2' . Fiddling through the whole list again and again is getting boring very soon. And looking at that nice car is no big fun, since there is no easy way to move the camera simply and freely.
There is no way to get rid of that music, the environmental sounds are extremely loud, so the endless repeating sound background is really nerve-wracking.

The game is very unstructured and seems to be a collection of completely different game ideas, and I always wonder what these Forza guys have been smoking. 
The menu system is a complete mess, and if you pick a task it sometimes is difficult to find out what the game wants you to do. Many of the tasks are ridiculously unrealistic, and for a normal human being like me simply unrealizable. 

As someone who drove a selection of the cars in real live, I would be very interested in tuning and driving a car realistically, going for a test ride on a favourite track, than tune again etc etc - improving my amateur skills again and again until changing to the next higher car class.

But there is even no means of getting your lap times for a certain track and car in order to compare cars or tunings, so it is more or less impossible to do a decent regular training.
The 'rivals' tab ingame does not really help, since it lacks the historical list of rivals and cars.
There is no chance of working on a serious and controlled skills improvement.

The potential of the game is by far better than what they made out of it.
As you might experience in the online-events, it is a game from muddlers for muddlers, all without a driving license.

What a pitty, what a waste !",0

9/10 - Fun arcade racing game to play alone or with friends. The graphic is stunning and it's also very well optimized for PC. I personally got around 70 fps on medium to high setting out of a 1050ti. I would recommend anyone to get the ultimate edition as it is the best bang for the buck, especially when it's on discount. The only downside to the game is that the Drivatars sometimes act a little weird and don't behave like human when driving; obviously they aren't human, but you get the point.",1

Considering forza 5 also has serious connection issues alongside of it bugs u may wanna give it a second thought on it  if u gonna play with ur friends. But if u don't experience any issues then the multiplayer has a lot to offer. It has even a battle royale :) but at this point only farming simulator doesn't has a battle royale mode.

The customisation of cars is kind of lacking in some respects (i.e. I want to actually refurb a car from scratch, which I know isn't the point of this game but still). Racing mechanics are nice and to top it all off, it's pretty easy to progress within the game. Overall, a solid 8/10 game for me. Will likely buy Forza 5 to see the difference!",1

When I reached the Autumn qualifier race in-game (after the sort-of prologue season), my game would not load beyond the title screen. Crash after crash for over 6 hours trying to get the game to work.

I searched online and many other people were experiencing this (for some reason, SPECIFICALLY after getting to the Autumn season which is bizzare, not as bizzare as the solution!).

Someone on a steam thread said to turn on Bluetooth... uhhh okay...? And like a miracale from god, after turning on my computer's bluetooth, the game loaded in.

This is unbelievable and should not be an issue for so many people. I cannot recommend a game with a bizarre bug that can completely ruin your entire experience if you play beyond the 2 hour refund time frame.",0

Music is pumping, until around 10 hours where you want it to stop. 
Storyline is okay with interesting missions, until around 10 hours where you still can't skip cutscenes or the storyline takes over your PC and does not allow you to skip.
 No CUTSCENE SKIP was my tipping point. Mother of God man, allow us to skip. 

Don't get me wrong, the sounds are great and the game is fun with cool missions. Fast pace chaos and skill if you're into that, but in no way is it a 'simulator'. It's a game and for that I can recommend it. But no cutscene option is obscene.",0

Like buying houses beauty spots lot of car jackpots speed catchers drift areas etc. i like this game very much but there is some things need to add.

1-Private message: I think we should have to message someone ingame.

2-text chat: Maybe only 100+ level players should use this but this feature needed to add. 

3-Double controls: sometimes i play with one hand keyboard so i shift up with q-e buttons but when i play with two hands i have to change controls for shift button every time and i think u want to solve this problem u have too add double buttons.

4- Cheaters need to banned! i looked a quests leaderboards and i see 00.00.05 second in the top and its actually impossibble for this quest. They was 150+ level with thia timing cuz they are cheated. They need to be banned.

HOWEVER

some of the story modes present you with tasks that are quite literally, not possible.

Chapter One of the Horizon Top Gear Special.

You're taking a Lotus 5.8 miles, but they want you to do it in under a minute and fourty seconds.

Thanks to the many twists and turns, (and that fact that it's FIVE POINT EIGHT FUCKING MILES), it isn't possible to achieve the three star goal in the given time. The car doesn't have the speed.


Another thing, Isha's Taxis is EXTREMELY glitchy. Constantly spawned me out of the map, the timer started speeding up, and sometimes it wouldn't let me use the ""restart event"" button.

I mean other than that the game is great.",1

Get the game on sale $32.98AUD (standard) or $52.48AUD (ultimate) as the game while great and vast has been out for lengthy period of time and is no longer worth $99.95AUD. In the case you do buy FH4, GET THE ULTIMATE EDITION!

16594,"This game features a setting in and around the UK that feels dreamlike to me. Graphics, combined with (mostly) realistic sound effects, and that [b] magnificent [/b] four-seasons, living, breathing atmosphere just sucks me in every time. Each season feels like a fresh start to this game. Then, when you take into account that this game is full of extra content that is quite different from the main gameplay while also being extremely fun to play, I really see no reason for anyone slightly interested in car/racing games to try out.

Microsoft offers the best regional pricing on all of its older titles including this one, so no matter where you live, this is a timeless classic and an instant buy when it's on sale. Yes, Forza Horizon games have some letdowns that alienate the hardcore racing game fans, but this game has quite a lot to offer to the fans from every corner of the casual-hardcore spectrum. Racing is extremely fun and varied, though it might not be realistic enough for the hardcore audience.

If exploring the amazing European landscape in every season of the year alone sounds interesting to you, just get this game and treat yourself. This game just fuses all the aspects you could possibly want from a (more casual) racing game into an exquisite masterpiece.",1

16726,"I spent about $70 on the game mainly from the high reviews and reputation it had with the racing and gaming community. The Forza horizon series is known for its open world feature. I originally loved the idea of this, thinking it would've been like GTA V for car enthusiasts. 

After having played the game for some time, I just lost interest. I have to admit that the car options and graphics are amazing, but I personally do not enjoy the controls. I had bad experiences with my Xbox/Microsoft account where it wouldn't let me access the auction house for some time, but mainly I kind of ran out of ideas on what to do in the game, and therefore made it boring. This is probably because I am more of a simcade racing fan though where physics and mechanics are more realistic, and the tracks are fixed and set, so this will not apply for everyone.

I feel like this game is mainly on personal preference, some may love it, some may not share the same experience. Especially with the hefty price tag I somewhat regret purchasing the game. If you do want to try the game out for yourself, I believe the Microsoft store on Windows offer a free Forza Horizon 4 demo where you can mess around for about a few hours. I regret skipping that step, and instead went straight for the purchase.

I am not sure yet where to head, nor whom to overtake, but the sheer driving experience is unimaginable to me.  I only have a RTX 2060, and it maintains 60fps.  There is no lag at all.  All I have to do is figure out what exactly you are supposed to do in this game!

Any links to tutorials would be helpful.

Thanks,

There is no way to report players in game. There are also aspects of the game that just seem like lazy game development (reflections, visual/graphic glitches, etc).

Update: Now online doesn't connect. Everything on my side is find, but I cannot do any online rewards.",0
16833,So fun if you know how to drift and use a control I do recomend not using keyboard as it does set you back in my first hour of playing when i used a keyboard. My best advice is learn how to drift when going fast and you cant do it on keyboard so best thing to do is use control if you have one if not its fine the games works perfectly without one.,1

16913,"The Forza franchise has come through, once again, with an excellent racing sim.  It feels realistic and challenging, yet somehow does not feel too dry or uninteresting.  No race modes compromise the emphasis of another; they all offer their own flavors, and do it pretty well.  

Multiplayer mechanics/matchmaking is really okay, it's just kinda there.  Maybe I don't try hard enough to make use of it, but I personally have not found it convenient to engage with other players. There are a few 'event' modes that will attract people to play with, but that's about it.  Playing with friends of course being slightly easier. 

8.5 / 10",1
16914,Fun.,1
16915,The story is interesting graphics are amazing and you can obtain cars pretty easy,1
16916,"Simply amazing.

Well fleshed out the dynamics of the this ""sim"" are excellent. Cars are customizable and plenty of variety through out the game. It starts of STRONG and you don't have to grind to get money cars too much. 

The quantity of different racing modes is what really appeals to me. Events like Top Gear challenges, dirt racing, Rally, and Stunt tracks are so well done, I can't find fault in any of them. 

Difficulty is well handled and the reason I love this so much. You've got the option of making things easy enough to enjoy the game and slowly crank things up as your skill progresses, all the way to high realism. This is usually a barrier in other games. You're not punished for being mediocre. Microsoft really innovated with the Rewind feature and this REALLY shines here. Forget about replaying the tracks if you make a minor mistake. Far from cheating, this tool allows for laser precision as a teaching tool. I was able to hone in on my weaknesses around various tracks and it quickly made me a better sim driver. Much faster than restarting every time I made a mistake. You have the option to not use it so die hard shouldn't hate. 

With a low barrier to fun, this game has everything I wanted in a vehicle racing sim and more. Come for the cool cars, stay for the amazing tracks and events.",1
16917,I suck at racing games but I like this one because of the free roam mode. I can just go out and drive or I can race if I want to. I got it on sale so it was worth the $20 for me.,1
16918,"I really hate to do this since I enjoyed the game so far, but the game was fun and working well until about 2.9 hours in when all of a sudden it crashed. I tried to boot it up again, and it would work until it tried loading in after I pressed continue, then it would crash again. I've tried reinstalling it, updating my game drivers, and lowering the memory that chrome uses, but none of them have seemed to work so far.

Update: Someone has helped me in the discussion board. It turns out that turning on Bluetooth can help resolve this issue somehow. I was just able to play and I can highly recommend this game again",1

16959,"First is what I don't like, Forza Horizon 4 is very very difficult to get started and the devs make you jump through hoops in order to get it working, like turning your firewall off, make sure windows 10 is up to date, make sure your graphics card is up to date bla bla bla, this game is harder to start than a 1990's ford escort with a Blown diff.

These sorts of problems occur when you try an integrate a game with operating system among other bloatware that don't work together and causes complications on Gamers PC's.

Concept of this game is the same as Need for speed pro street, The map I have discovered is same as or vicer versa Forza Horizon 5, the difference is devs have moved different road ways from one section of the map to another, don't believe me? look at the huge motorway in both FH4 and FH5 practically the same but moved to different sections of the map, Devs are doing what the Cod devs use to do recycle same map over and over again and change a few things in hopes that gamers wouldn't notice and oh but changed the scenery to match the country, UK moist, Mexico dry.

It looks pretty and plays well when it works.

By the way I have intel 9th gen 9700 8 core cpu
Gtx1070 8GB
32 GB of ram
mid range SSD card for storage

you would think with this setup I wouldn't have any issues, generally I don't that would indicate issues are coming from the product which has been poorly made.

16971,"This Microsoft Studios game absolutely refuses to detect my Microsoft XBOX controller which works with literally every other game I own. Googling for a solution leads to nothing helpful or of substance and if you look in the discussions for this game there are others who are recently experiencing this issue who are not being helped. I've updated everything, unplugged everything, messed with steam configurations to no avail. Was really looking forward to playing this as a christmas treat but instead 2 hours of my christmas free time have been sunk into troubleshooting why literally only this game refuses to detect the recent controller made by the same company. Frankly, a disgrace.

Edit: I was able to find a fix for the controller issue:
On the page for the game in your library, click the settings gear, click properties >controller, and under the dropdown for ""Override for Forza Horizon 4"" set it to ""Disable Steam Input"". This fixed the issue for me.",1

17107,"Forza Horizon 4 entered my library on a whim. It looked like a neat game, and I had heard that the FH series is somewhat like Burnout: Paradise, which is one of my favorite games from a while back.

It turns out that, yes, the Burnout: Paradise comparison is apt, and yes, this game is ridiculously fun. I legitimately did not expect to spend a whole weekend playing this nonstop, nor did I expect that I’d turn around and buy the two DLC expansions to get more races and cars to screw around with. It has somehow ended up becoming one of my favorite games of the past few years. 

FH4 is heavily concerned with your fun. There are a number of things you can customize to either make the game a good simulation racer, or you can turn it into a ridiculous arcade game. You can spend hours of your time tuning your favorite sports car to perfection, or you can buy a GMC Van, download a livery to make it look like the Mystery Machine from Scooby Doo, tune it to go 170mph, and barrel through the British countryside knocking down trees and fences. 

The game scales every race to the kind of car you are driving, and for the most part, you have freedom to drive anything in any race. If you want to be serious and take your tuned up sports car to long races, or if you want to be a moron and drive a 3-wheeled baby car that struggles to go up hills, the game will tune the race to your level. You don’t even need to worry about winning, for the most part. In championship races and for some of the DLC races, getting first place is important, but otherwise it doesn’t really matter much except that you get more bonuses at the end to spend on cars. It’s strangely refreshing to not be worried about nailing first in every single race. With the way the game scales each event, I often find myself purposefully driving crappy cars just for the fun of it.

I could gush about how fun FH4 is for a long time, mainly because it was such an expectedly fun game that makes an effort at making sure you are having fun while playing it. The little things that bothered me about the game didn’t take away from how much fun the whole experience was. If you are going to pick this game up, I heartily recommend picking up the full package that comes with the DLC (Fortune Island and LEGO Speed Champions).",1

It's a massive open world with endless possibility and opportunity and a [i] lot [/i] of cars to choose from. The depth into which you can tune the cars you have at your disposal is outstanding and the constant changing of seasons and ever shifting list of events that comes with it ensures that even seasoned players always have something new to do",1

If your that one person who like to cruise or likes to do role-play this is the game for you its super realistic and it gets better if you have a steering wheel. Its cool because you can use the dream car you like without wasting money of gas lmao.

17189,"Came back to this after playing it on release with Gamepass and just having a great time in Horizon 5. This was such a great entry and huge improvement over what I felt was a pretty stale third entry overall. You have so many cars to mess around with and being able to get this on sale with everything that was added is the way to go. The two DLCs are great and add some fun new things. Lego is always going to be a draw, which they do some great things with to vary up what the normal gameplay with. You aren't just stuck in the added cars either, it encourages you to use cars you wouldn't normally have brought out to do some of the challenges.  After that (or before, it's your choice), you get to do Fortune Island which focuses on extreme weather racing. I loved this DLC as creates an enormous amount of variety in a little island. You get to do some of the better dirt tracks along with some great street style stuff.  Adding on top of that are the huge cash prizes you get for completing the different riddles, which add a great layer of fun to exploring. So far I have only done the DLC this time around, but I am going to dive in and do the main races as well now. Of note for people looking at this versus 5, the main campaign style racing is much more open from the beginning and doesn't filter you down a path of unlockables.",1
17190,"Great game, well worth the discounted price. Zero quality issues (crashes, bugs), drawing distance could be better and sometimes cars change color right after they appear =) About 20 hours in now, expect to get over 100 hours out of this.",1

Pros: realistic graphics, realistic driving experience, significantly more car tuning options/gears than other racing games, huge range of creative liveries, wide range of difficulty/driving options suitable for all levels of players, variety of racing events/missions, rewind option, etc. (especially fun to play when tired after work/school/bs)

Cons: do NOT use keyboard for this game. Drifting with keyboard is just bs. On top of this, drifting in this game imitates real-life drifting, meaning it is much harder than drifting in other racing games, but u will get better and better at it along the way.",1

17217,"The good: It's a beautiful game that runs well and has a ton of content. The racing is fun, there's a lot of customization, and seasonal events refresh every week to keep things fresh. I was put off by the ""MMO"" aspect at first but they've managed to pull it off in a way that's unobtrusive and fun; and you can still play offline if you prefer. It's the most fun I've had on a racing game in a long time.

The bad: The devs engage in a lot of shady, unethical practices. Unskippable video ads for DLC in between certain events; bugs that are known, old, and will never be patched because they're already focused on the next game; buggy and often unplayable multiplayer (which is a shame because a lot of season rewards are bound to multiplayer events); and ""matchmaking"" that does nothing to match you up with players close to your skill. It's a shame they don't care enough to fix these easily fixable problems, so I can't recommend it.",0

Game has an unskippable intro. You also seem to be getting video ads for DLCs, unskippable as well.

17261,"Je n’avais jamais joué à un Forza auparavant. Très bon jeu.
 
Plutôt que de redire ce que d'autres ont dit sur le jeu, voilà ce que je vais rajouter: 

-  Même après la sortie de Forza Horizon 5, ça vaut le coup d'acheter (aussi) Forza Horizon 4, ne serait-ce que je préfère l'Angleterre au Mexique.

- Le DLC ""Hot Wheels™ Legends Car Pack"" (6 voitures) n'est  pas présent dans la version Ultimate.

- Pour acquérir de nouvelles voitures, je n’aurais qu'un mot à dire: enchères, enchères, enchères... (ok les tirages aussi) mais surtout enchères, je préfère d'ailleurs plutôt obtenir lors d'un tirage 100, 000 Crédits que je dépenserai dans les enchères à une voiture de rareté bleue.

Sinon, je conseillerai d'installer Forza 4 Horizon sur SSD (le conseil est encore plus valable pour Forza Horizon 5)

World is not extremely large a la Just Cause, but its enough to have varied vistas while racing. There are a ton of cars, even some that are really bad, so every type of driver can drive what they want. I have a three-wheeled van with waifu paint job and training wheels. Something for everyone. One small complaint: I think there is a memory leak or the game doesn't release assets when they're not in use anymore because I get buttery smooth 130 fps on ultra settings at 2550x1440 at startup, but after about 3 hours of driving across the island I end up with 80 fps and choppy with shadows and textures popping in and out.

Nearly made me not recommend the game. Especially, when I haven't even got close to playing through the game yet, I'm like 5 hours in and I had to watch through two unskippable adverts. I usually pay for stuff so that I do not see advertisements.",1

I bought this game for $20 so I give it a 5/10

17568,nice,1
17569,cannot use wheel on steam too bad,0
17570,"Games sucks. Controls are either too sensitive for a steering wheel, or not sensitive enough. It basically forces you to use a controller, because you sure as s*** ain't using a mouse and keyboard (this ain't GMod controlling, sadly. Can barely fine-tune it). Only can modify Tire Pressure at the beginning (WTF), can't get a f***ing game that's supposed to be centered all around cars to work decently with a high-grade steering wheel. I have to set the b**** to 270 degrees rather than the preferred 900 degree limit to compensate for this game's lack of control responsiveness. 


Devs were more worried about getting some stupid a** LEGO racing into the game (WHICH NO ONE ASKED FOR, LAST TIME I CHECKED) than getting controls to accurately function in the game. I should not be forced to use a damn CONTROLLER over a STEERING WHEEL to get this game to function correctly!

I even had to modify the damn dead-zones, and all that does it just make it more damn wacky. It doesn't sync to your steering wheel set-up AT ALL...

There's only ONE good thing about this game, and that's that got All The Remains into the game as far as music. The rest is just... ""Ear-bleed causing"", or at least the majority is. Some are not bad. Still, can't select wtf you want to listen to, like you could with say.... Need For Speed. At least the last game I played of that series. 

If you're expecting simulation-level controls, FORGET THIS GAME.",0

17657,"Oh, my, lord... you need to get this game if you LOVE open world games! I'll admit, I was a little disappointed that the map wasnt this huge landscape, but as I got more into the game, it is a really huge map with highways,  cities, great lakes, and gigantic mountains! Even if you think that you wont be able to play this game with mouse and keyboard,  GET THIS GAME, its really not all that difficult with a mouse and keyboard! I also want to add that the amount of detail they put into the car models is STUNNING, I mean, its just like looking at my car in real life! In addition, the community of this game is very good! if you get this game, I suggest you join the Forza official discord server, you can learn a lot from it! In conclusion, Forza horizon 4 is an amazingly beautiful game, that you should definitely try for yourself, if you like open world/ simulation games.

P.S:
I would also like to add that you dont need this super gaming computer to run it! Forza automatically chooses the best settings for your computer, and optimizes the game for you so that it still looks great!",1

17666,"pretty fun, but it's pretty incredible how a microsoft game has so many crashes, bugs, freezes on a high end windows platform. There's a ton of people having issues on a wide range of hardware, with little to no clear workarounds. In my case the game freezes over after exact 1 hour of gameplay.
 I've bought this game in sale, but i prefer a working title and paying full price. In this state i can't recommend it, and it doesn't seem that most crashes will be adressed with future patches ,since FH5 has been released.",0

And refresh the page and restart the memory?
Respark the soul and rebuild the energy?
We stopped the ignorance, we killed the enemies
Sorry for the night demons that still visit me
The plan was to drink until the pain over
But what's worse, the pain or the hangover?
Fresh air, rolling down the window
Too many Urkels on your team, that's why your wins low

17784,"One of the best racing games I've seen, If you are a racing newbie like me, this game is a good one to learn on. It has this line that turns yellow and red to tell you if you are going too fast for the upcoming turn.... REALLY handy for learning the ropes. It's not too hard core as a driving simulator either... If you can't do ok turn down the difficulty or try a different car. Seriously, you might get last place every time in one car, but try a different car and you might be starting to see first place. Find the car that works for you.

Anyway, lots to do and much fun to be had. The one caution I would give is that this game has high requirements for your computer. I thought my 10 year old computer was still reasonably good, but the game proceeded to warn me that it was BELOW the lowest requirements. LOL I laugh because after tooning the game for my computer, as it recommends, it lowered my resolution, but the game plays fine. So if you don't have a top end computer, this game will likely not look as good as it could, but it'll still play fine. So it's all good in my book. :)",1

17903,"Overall i guess it is a pretty good arcade racing game. it ticks all the right boxes, great cars with beautiful visuals, the landscapes are gorgeous and it is fun to just drive around, they have a decent amount of cars available, and the online features work great.

now.... as for the downsides. the game can be plaid by a toddler, i guess that is part of the target audience. for me though within my first 30 min of playing I already had over 10 cars, everyone kept giving me cars for no reason, I have absolutely no use for my in game cash apart from buying cars I want to drive, I feel that there should be some element of struggle while building up your career.

as a final point I do recommend the game because there are definitely fun elements and it is a good looking game but i find it hard to play for long periods of time because it doesn't feel like there is any real progression",1

17961,"Very well ballanced racing game that found a sweet spot between arcade and realism, while still keeping the fun.
Plus the overall the game has very relaxing feeling as it' great to jump in, do a few races and then jump out.

Pros:
- The unique 4 season UK themed map.
- variety of weather conditions and day-night cycle
- the driving model is well ballanced between arcade an realism - each car type feels different, each track ground feel different, even different track state is different (dry, wet, snow, ice), you simply can't be bored and always find something new and fun.
- good soundtrack and radio stations.
- variety of race types (sprint, drift, off-road, city races).
- fun mini-stories (like Top Gear, Delivery Company, Insurance Claim company, Upgrade Heroes)
- bazilion of cars to choose.
- many collectibles and challenges.
- customizable difficulty (the default one was relaxing for me, while giving me a challenge just from time to time)

Cons:
- unskippable victory animations.
- choosable player characters are absolutely ugly, there are only 2 or 3 that doesn't make your eyes bleed.
- chothes accessories can only be won in lottery, but most of them are stupid/meme clothes.
- the overall concept of lottery completely destroy the progression - either you're showered with tons of cars liek no tommorow, or you get junk clothes that even clown would be ashemed to wear.
- some mini-stories and characters have really cringe and corny dialogues (e.g. The Taxi company).
- there is not much progression beyone a few initial rounds of racing.
- the car selection screen GUI is very poor and gets worse with the amount of cars we get.
- suprisingly, there is waaaaay to many cars - I got like 60 cars from lottery, but I use 4 at best.

18095,"This is a really great game. I'm not so good at racing sims normally but this one is a lot more forgiving than some of the others I've played. The gfx and controls are basically flawless and this game gives you a lot of ways to make it more or less challenging by enabling or disabling things like assisted steering, automatic shifting and instant rewind as well as 5 difficulty settings that never really penalize you for making it as easy as possible. I snagged the Ultimate version of this game and I must say, the number of cars it gives you right from the beginning is absolutely unbelievable! I may never drive them all, but having this many choices and an abundance of resources for upgrades and customization, makes this game an instant favorite for me. I keep telling all my friends they should buy it now while it's on sale because in terms of value, this game delivers far more than I ever could have imagined!

18237,"Game crashes every 2-3 hours of play.  Disabling xbox live helped somewhat but unable to find a complete solution.  It sucks extra because you have zero control over when and where the game saves so you have no idea how much time and effort you have lost until you reload.

Oversteer is stupidly out of whack.  By default EVERY car has huge amounts of oversteer to the point that they're undrivable.  Your rear end will be severely fishtailing on you at every corner and every time you touch the brakes and if you try to correct it you will get rewarded with a spin in the other direction.  It can be fixed in the tuning garage if you know car setup telemetry but shouldn't need to be.

Engine sounds are inexcusably terrible.  A supercharged V-10 '70 Corvette with race exhaust sounds like stiff playing cards in the spokes of a bicycle.  A Polaris RZR 1000 sounds exactly like my neighbor's electric leaf blower.   The Buick Grand National sounds like a Prius with stock exhaust.  A Shelby King Cobra could pass for a Ninja Smoothie Blender.  Just a few highlights but there are over 700 car sounds that suck badly and about 23 that are good.

But the worst idea they had was to include LEGO and HOTWHEELS cars.   Gag me with a maggot.",0

However it's marred by crash to desktop every hour or two, unskipable commercials, and it feels like an absolute minimum effort console port.

Edit: Changed from thumbs down to thumbs up; Crash to desktop was solved with adding a bigger Pagefile in Windows. Even with 16GB physical RAM, more Pagefile was required. But at least it's not crashing often. Unskippabe commercials are still present though not so often. Would be nice to be able to skip cutscenes in general.",1

Проблема в том, что сначала игры у тебя есть полный доступ ко всему, деньги льются рекой, проблем накопить на машину нет. И это главный минус. Мне, как человеку, который привык тратить по несколько часов за игрой, чтобы открыть и купить интересную мне машину, было это в новизну и сильно отталкивает. Вот вы катаетесь на Форд Фокус начальном, через часа 3 у вас в распоряжении МакЛарен. 

Физика отдельная тема. Можно ее конечно настроить под себя, но пробуксовка на любом автомобиле со временем вам сильно надоест. Иногда кажется, что разработчики особо то и не управляли машиной в жизни. Не все автомобили уходят в занос на каждом повороте. Однако есть автомобили, которыми очень удобно и приятно управлять, например Mercedes CLK GTR или Jeep Trailcat. Авто реально все по разному управляются, но дрифт очень надоедает со врменем. 

К автопарку вопросов нет, машин много.

There are some cars you'd want that aren't in this game (probably) but they do have a f***ing warthog from halo!

+ large amounts of cars
+ good optimization (GTX 1060 is good enough for 1080p@60fps)
+ driving is enjoyable (most of the times)

[b] Cons: [/b]
- you cannot disable cut-scenes
- no radio station persistence (if you disable the radio, any cut-scene or fast-travel might enable it again)
- you cannot switch to correct driving side (game is located in UK, thus defaults to left handed driving side, which cannot be changed)
- difficulty jumps (you might finish one race in 1/3 of the given time and the next one will be almost impossible to finish with more than 2 stars)
- restarting a race (i.e. if you f' up and want to redo it) can take more time to load than the race itself
- car stats do not mean jack (they seem to be relative, not absolute, thus rendering them pretty useless)
- unskippable ads for DLCs 
- absolute clusterf' of an UI (you will get used to it)

If you like car racing games and want something great to play with a gamepad, go for it!
I mean, I like racing sims and love to play Assetto Corsa with G29 on a ""proper"" sim rig, but Forza Horizon Series is another thing!
While it doesn't feel good with a steering wheel, FH is excellent and light years ahead of any Need for Speed, which was my ""keyboard/gamepad-arcade"" game of choice for a long time, until the original Carbon.
I recommend you to play Horizon with an Xbox One controller, or at least not on keyboard, for the best experience!",1
18674,Great game! Its really realistic and good. Litearlly same as Forza Horizon 5 theres just better car sounds and more cars and a new map.They could've done this to Forza Horizon 4 just add the map and a plane and update the sound and add the cars.,1

18686,"Got this because I have a G29, the most mass-market of all wheels. Game is supported for the wheel, yet for some strange reason after driving straight for 10 seconds, it automatically turns left or right. Inverting the FFB helped...until it didn't. Yes, I have GHub opened at the same time; yes it did the calibration. It simply malfunctions: phantom throttle presses, unregistered presses (even in offline solo mode). I even checked online for any presets, but presets won't help with phantom registers. Okay, so then I played the game with an Xbox controller. Got first in every event. So no, this game isn't recommended for a AAA title failing to integrate the most popular wheel out there. But it is recommended for Xbox controller-only play. It's a shame, because it has everything else going for it. But even NFS can be perfectly fun with just the basic features of G29 supported. Project Cars, perfect integration. Assetto Corsa, Dirt Rally 2, minor tweaking to go. If Forza 5 support for wheels is like this, then this review works for that game as well. A driving game without a steering wheel is simply garbage.

Edit: Wheel works with the game on a different PC. Keeping the review negative because it should work fine on all PCs. Problem could be Logitech and may be fixed in Forza 5 so to each their own mileage. Controller is still a better option because it just feels more accurate. Love the instant rewind feature in the races. The one thing that separates this game from all my other racing games. Very innovative as far as I know. If you are going to gamble on this purchase, get it on discount. It's still a very good game...using controllers.",0

There is no building up a career . You just get a very fast car and drive it around . Nothing fun about that . No gathering money , no building reputation , just a lot of cars and impressive graphics ... 

"" Gameplay is not linear . "" I mean you get out of your garage and there is thousands of races you can go but no connection between them . You can just start whereever you want . And that is meaningless .",1

18727,"Its an amazing game, hell probably one of the best racing games out there. It mixes sim like racing with arcade style racing in such a flawless manner that I often think to myself ""Why can't all racing games be like this?"". Its fun and a very chill game. However, if I'm to criticise this game, the very praise I give the game becomes its dark side. The game just gives out rewards, leaving the player unsatisfied with the achievements they receive. For example, in Horizon 1, each purchase of a car was calculated, as every race event in that game required the player to meet certain criteria when entering the event. This made the player competitive when it comes to races as they have to win in order to get money so that they can buy a great car. But in Horizon 4, the event changes according to the car wit which you enter. Yes, it becomes more player friendly, but i feel it removes the challenge aspect. A game can be in the form of a stress free capsule like ABZU, but Forza Horizon isn't such a title. You have the open world which is amazing and calm to drive in, but the races are to challenging. The game fails to balance challenge with the sense of relaxation. What I'm trying to say is that the sense of progression is not present in Horizon 4. You can complete 3/4th of the game with the cars they provide for free in the initial stages. There is no sense of achievement when one shows in a Chiron in Horizon 4's multiplayer as the obvious thought which goes into the opposition's mind is ""Oh, they must've gotten it in a wheel spin!"" Even though the player might've played and bought the car with the credits he earned. 

To complain that a game is giving out huge in-game rewards for free feels like a douchy thing to say. But it removes the challenge from the game. With that being said, Horizon 4 isn't a bad game. Its an amazing game. The graphics, the gameplay all checks out. But I'm not so happy with the reward system. Its too REWARDING. Balance it out, THEN you have the best racing game in the world

I think they should've just concentrated on Edinburgh and it's outskirts or maybe just Scotland, rather than creating an unrealistic map of the UK with selected major landmarks, which for example makes the Uffington White Horse and Edinburgh Castle appear a lot closer to each other than they are in real life.

18869,"Forza Horizon 4 is like the Leonardo Da Vinci of racing games. In this game, Britain is so beautifully breathtaking in all 4 seasons. The graphics are super realistic and super optimised with any gaming PC! Even the driving mechanics feel amazingly realistic while still having the arcade feel. It's insane that this game has 724 licensed cars. On top of that, the seasonal playlist and wheelspins constantly reward you with new cars. 10/10, an absolute superb masterpiece that's a must try if you like racing games. GG!",1

18964,"Forza Horizon 4 is an unbelievably beautiful game.  It manages to sink you into its reality and just let you go.  With that being said, the first 3-4 hours are tutorial races, and when I bought this game to play it with friends, the fact I couldn't go online until way later was an enormous hassle.  This, combined with the constant interruptions from your in-game companions always updating you about what's new on the map and telling you to open it is really frustrating.  As it is, it's a really good game except nobody knows how to shut up.  But the driving controls are amazing and most of the races are fun!!!",1

19228,"This game reminds me of my childhood, is a racing game that i always played.
I think xbox doing a good job to implement a real racing simulation in this game, even many old car models in this game with zuper duper graphics.

worth it to buy~",1
19229,"Looks immaculate, and the car customization is really cool.",1

I mean the graphics are amazing unlike any other, and the cars themselves are outstanding i mean so many to choose from, even now they are still adding more and more but of course there's so many yet never enough XD. The game play is perfect for any person who loves car/racing games. Although this game is a literal do what ever you want, race who ever you want(except regular civilians), and drive whatever you want(except for tanks and larger/military vehicles including jets, bikes, and boats).
Although I feel it is getting less enjoyable it is still a great game and would recommend it to people who are interested.",1
19236,),1
19237,"Forza Horizon 4 is the best open world game I've played, Britain is a wonderful place to just drive around, I love the expansion DLCs as well, Fortune Island and LEGO Valley are well crafted little areas to escape to for when you just want a quick change of scenery, Fortune Island with it's adventurous vibes and LEGO Valley with it's LEGO built environment. The music has been well picked, Horizon Pulse, Horizon Bass Arena, Horizon Block Party, Horizon XS, Hospital Records, Timeless FM, and LEGO Valley exclusive Radio Awesome are all amazing and bound to have something for everyone to listen to, or there's always the option to turn the in-game radio off and just enjoy the sound of your engine roaring in a race. Internet isn't required to play as Horizon Solo is the offline/single player option, but I highly recommend playing while connected to the internet and signed into XBOX Live, as most the best content is user created and you'll need internet and an XBOX Live profile to access it. Huge selection of cars to choose from, so pick your favorites and burn that rubber. happy gaming!",1

19398,"Forza Horizon 4 is a very appetizing racing game, whether you're a casual player or a racing simulator player who wants control over his car, even at low to moderate levels.

The freedom offered in this game is very interesting to explore, because you can be the type of player you like, you can play casually, you can also play competitively through ranked adventure mode.

The weakness of this game is in the mode which is enough to repeat if you are far in this game. and also the time gate that limits us to get all the cars in this game.

And the biggest drawback is .... the multiplayer mode is very inefficient and also very difficult for casual players to understand, due to the multilayer log-in that you have to do to play this game with your friends.",1

19577,"It is a beautiful game, but if it is more appropriate for sim game rather than arcade it will be excellent...",1
19578,Forza 4 over Forza 5 cause the street races and city areas are funner.,1

19580,After a couple of hours of gameplay it starts to feel repetitive...,1
19581,This Game is Outstanding even tho the 5 has came out ! <2,1

19589,"quintessential racing game, a little bit of everything, and has enough cars for everyone to find a fave",1
19590,"Hours upon hours of fun. Gorgeous visuals and a good amount of graphical settings to mess around with. It's not perfect though - absolutely insufferable, annoying voice acting/characters, which is worsened by the fact that you can't skip intro logo (very loud), cinematics or those 'pre-mission' cutscenes where those sim-looking characters do the same animations over and over, until the annoying voice lines stop. Seriously, sometimes it feels like someone is doing a 'excited influencer' bit. It is a very good game though.",1

2. The features you would expect in an arcade experience like to player how many laps they would like and how many laps in a race. Forza 4 is great at motivating the player to drive and provides various ways to help the player enjoy the game. The game also has an incredible graphics that almost brings to life the car's models.

With a feel like no other driving game out there and a great collection of vehicles to drive, it is ideal for a simulator driver. It is great to see that some of the biggest names in the simracing world are featuring in Forza 4.

To put the icing on the cake, this game is a great game for the Xbox gamer. If you are looking to upgrade from your old Xbox or if you are looking to buy an Xbox One as a Christmas present, then Forza 4 is the ideal game for you.

5. The cars that you get to drive are just awesome!

The cars are the big highlight for most racing gamers. And Forza 4 has that depth in car customization that makes the game special. From the epic Cosworth AC, Nissan GTR or even the new NISSAN GT-R, there is a car out there for you.

6. That driving is a blast!

You can choose from one of the 20 plus cars and drive the best tracks out there in Forza 4. It is almost impossible not to have a more fun time driving a car around the world. The tracks in this game are so iconic and famous that it makes you want to drive them all!

7. New features are added to this every year

With Forza 4, the developers always add something new to the game. New races, new cars, new tracks, new challenges and last but not least, new ways to play the game. In fact, it is a treat for gamers who loveingly play Forza Motorsport for many years to have a game that is just as fun and user friendly with a lot of updates to make the game that much more fun for both casual and hardcore racing gamers.

8. The tracks are varied

As you would expect from the makers of the Forza series, the tracks are varied, and all so fun to drive. As a fan of Forza Motorsport, you can expect the best tracks you have ever played.

To prove it, we compared the track Forza 4 features against the rest of the top racers and came up with the most impressive, and here are some of them:

Tune Yards

Unlike the road car racing games, we will not come to a halt every time a corner is coming up. We don't want to be reminded of what else we could have been doing. Also, you will be able to enjoy this game no matter the traffic conditions.

All time Achiever Track

Again unlike other racers, here the objective is simple and it is to drive the fastest time on the track. This tracks challenges you to drive the fastest lap in no less than four laps. The Time Trial track ranks the fastest competitors in the world and if you...i ran out of free characters",1
19794,yes yes very gud,1
19795,LOVE THIS GAME,1
19796,"TL;DR: Basically the best racing arcade of all time.

Before starting, i want to say that it is NOT a simulator, for those of you who want hyperrealistic physics, buy other games as Assetto Corsa, iRacing or F1.

Despite Forza Horizon 5 is available, i still think that FH4 is just better because of the low price compared to 5th part. And i tried FH5, it just not have enough reasonable changes to buy it for full price right now (get gamepass)

The biggest advantage of this game is of course the freedom. You can do basically whatever you want, from racing on small fiats 500 to tuning your ferrari 599XX Evo to go 500kph. There is an endless amount of activities, cars and fun in this game. You can try a lot of different cars youve probably seen in movies or always wanted to have. From 1930s racing cars to cyberpunk quadra v-tech, only you choose what to drive. My personal best if Ford GT40 Mk II. Despite being a arcade game, it has options to turn this game into semi-simulator. You can adjust your tire pressure, gearbox, antiroll bars and other stuff if you want. Also this game has a very good system of difficulty. There are many AI difficulties as well as assists, if you turn off some of them, you get more credits from the race.
The game has amazing multiplayer. Apart from freeroam with random players, there are: team games, battle royale (sort of), regular races, championships and head-to-head races.

In conclusion, i love this game.

P.S. BUY THE ULTIMATE VERSION, YOU WONT REGRET THIS",1

19823,This game just makes me come back. Years of playing the Forza franchise from Forza Motorsport 2 and Forza Horizon to now this. Its so nostalgia playing this game again so much time wasted playing these games but so much happiness gained from this franchise. Would recommend to anyone who has a love for a cars or even if they don't have the interest just play it for a general laughs and good times that this game has brought me over nearly a decade.,1
19824,It's a very fun game however the performance is not the best. You can get decent graphics and fps without a monster PC but the game crashes fairly often. Not a dealbreaker but I would not pay full price. It's definitely worth it if you get it on sale.,1

19836,"This game never bothers to explain a fair bit, especially with the multiplayer stuffs. 

As for singleplayer, the AI is absolute garbage, which is rather important in an Arcade racer...

Lower difficulties always work out in one of two ways: Give a good race for the first half then follow legal speed limits, or shoot way ahead for the first half then follow legal speed limits for the second half
Middle difficulties also work out in one of two ways: Either they don't put up a fight at all, or 1 or 2 of them shoot way out ahead and the rest don't put up a fight
Unbeatable difficulty is just a demo-derby with physics defying cars that miss the checkpoints by half a mile....",0

19913,"Although I first started racing games with F1 2008, I also played NFS games a lot. I never really liked the Forza Horizon or Forza Motorsport series because of the popularity of NFS at the time, but after playing Forza Horizon 3 and 4, I realized that I had made a huge mistake. First of all, I liked that Turn10 and Playground Games came up with two different Forza series to the players: While Forza Motorsport mostly includes competitions on F1 tracks, the Horizon series includes open world races and most likely the developers will come up with a new Forza Motorsport in 2020.

Forza Horizon 4 may be one of the greatest games I've ever played, as I've never played a racing game in the last 3-4 years, for its visual feast, gameplay, optimization, endless activities, and more. The intro of Horizon 4 has a perfect opening that I have perhaps never seen in any game: When you first enter the game, you participate in the race with Mclaren Senna, the car named after the F1 driver (Ayrton Senna de Silva) who died during the race in the 1994 San Marino GP. it introduces its beautiful landscapes and in a way teaches the mechanics in the game. After racing with Mclaren Senna for a while, we move on to the ""Winter"" season of the game after a small animation transition. In winter, we use a powerful pickup truck instead of Mclaren Senna, and the game introduces you to how difficult the winter season is. After racing for a while with the truck that the game gives you, we pass to the ""Spring"" season and things get more and more interesting here. We are controlling one of the rally cars in the summer and there are motorcyclists as our competitors. When I first saw this event, “Or can we ride a motorcycle?!” I lost my mind, but unfortunately we couldn't drive. After the rally race against motorcyclists is over, we enter the ""Summer"" season with the Mclaren Senna car that he introduced at the beginning of the game, and we have finished the race at the Horizon Festival, as in other games of Forza Horizon.",1
