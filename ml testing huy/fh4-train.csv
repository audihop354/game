5,Finally I can stop playing The Crew 2 for the rest of my life,1
6,"[h1]SMOOTH RIDING WITH A FEW BUMPY ROADS[/h1]

First off, I am going to get this out of the way. If you are planning to buy this game and wondering which version to get, ask yourself this. If you are a minimalist, standard is fine. If you want the expansions, get ultimate. Deluxe on the other hand I think is worth skipping entirely. If $99.99 is too much for you for Ultimate, just wait for a sale. Ultimate is definitely my choice for recommendation. The amount of content you get is impressive and worth the price of admission. 

Forza Horizon 4 is a car collector's dream, with a roster of over 700 cars (with Ultimate). And also a racing enthusiasts dream playground with a decently sized map with tons of racing variety and events to play around with. I have tons of racing games on Steam personally, and none have held my interest as much as Forza Horizon 4. It's a shame though that this came so late to Steam. But even still, I got my money's worth with over 120 hours of playtime at the time of writing this. 

Is Forza Horizon 4 perfect though? Sadly, it is not. The Steam version is hampered with some unfortunate bugs. People may experience random crashes, which while not happening often after the last few updates, still do happen, as this game is a few versions behind the Microsoft store's own version. Something I don't know if will ever be fully fixed. Also online racing can be hit or miss with issues. Those issues usually lie in the wait times sadly, so it might be offputting for those looking to race with others. Luckily there is more than enough content without having to do online races to keep most people happy. 

 I'm still giving this a recommend regardless of that issue, just because more often than not, the game does run smoothly. 

If you happen to just get the standard version of the game you get access to the main map which is a caricatured version of Great Britain, which includes many race events ranging from your standard street races, dirt tracks and even full blown off road events. There are also other events which include speed traps, drifting, massive jumps, promotional events (like racing the Halo Warthog, racing against trains, and more), and some cool little story events like racing for Top Gear, or even opening your own businesses. There's plenty of content for sure. If you decide to get the expansions, you get other maps, including Fortune Island, which is, well, an Island, complete with both low and high altitude locations, lots of off roading, some impressive night time visuals (Aurora Borealis anyone?), and more. You also get the Lego Speed Champions map which is a fun and impressively designed map based on the Lego toys which features it's own variety of fun and unique settings, including a beach riddled with pirate ships, a haunted lighthouse, a stunt arena, and more. Also it gets it's own radio station that plays just 1 song on loop. If you guessed that song is ""Everything is Awesome"", you'd be right, Both expansions also come with a unique way of progression and their own vehicles to collect. Fortune Island will have you progress to unlock a variety of treasure hunts, that each unlock 1 million credits, and the Lego expansion has you doing different tasks to collect studs which can be used to build your house and also collect new cars. Both expansions will also include a majority of the types of events you will be used to in the base game, with their own unique flair. 

With 700 cars luckily there is enough variety for anyone. But for those looking for more, you can custom tune each vehicle to your own liking, with a variety of parts and overhauls, including full blown engine swaps. For those who are not gear heads, the community has you covered and you can even download custom tunes from others. Forza Horizon 4 is one of the most generous racing games I have ever played with the sheer amount of cars they dump on you. You can win cars from events. You can win cars from wheelspins. you can win cars from leveling up. You can win cars from performing certain tasks. You can win cars from barn finds, which are like little treasure hunts. You can also buy cars from both an auto show, or take your chances at an in game auction house, which is also a great way to make money, to well, buy more cars. Basically, Horizon does not let you down with the cars. It's like Pokemon for car lovers. And once you have that dream car, don't forget to give it that unique look. Most cars can have some visual parts swapped out, ranging from spoilers to bumpers and more, and you can add custom designs to the paint jobs too. Want to race around in Jurassic Park Jeep? Want to race around in the Bandit 1 from Smokey and the Bandit? Forza has you covered. And if you just want to look at the cars in all their glory, Forza also has a nice little feature called Forzavista which allows to do things with your car like opening and closing doors, and for some vehicles you can open up trunks and hoods and look inside at the engines. If you get the James Bond pack, you can even look at those nifty little gadgets like the machine guns mounted to some of the Bond vehicles. Pretty neat stuff. 

At the end of the day, is Forza Horizon 4 worth it? I'd say yes.",1

13,"Forza Horizon 4 is remarkable game. It's a racer that's for everybody, instantly accessible for people who don't play racing games, but with enough depth and difficulty to satisfy gamers who prefer simulation. The very premise of Horizon 4 is fun. The quirky, bouncy voice-overs and the festival vibe keeps things free and light-hearted. Races are aimed at creating tight, balanced races that are fun no matter what vehicle you drive, and it does this well. It's fun to just jump in a random race you find.

There is a lot of depth to the game, multiple race disciplines keep things interesting and all are genuinely fun. If you get bored of one discipline you can jump in another and get the hang of it really quickly. It doesn't force you through awkward drifting mini-games or shift orientated drag races.

Graphically the game is stunning. There is no other word, the cars and environments are photo-realistic. Set any screenshot as my desktop background and I wouldn't even suspect it wasn't the Lake District. The cars themselves look fantastic lighting is done very well.

The seasons mechanics is one of the main attractions to Forza Horizon 4 and have to say it is an interesting one. Certain driving disciplines are more tailored to different seasons, so Winter is good for dirt for example, and Summer more for road racing, and that can get frustrating if you want to change seasons. Seasons are locked to the servers, meaning every week they change, you can't change them in game by moving ahead seasons for example. Each season though does look amazing in its own way, and adds diversity to game campaign.

Forza Horizon 4 is a beautiful game, well-polished and full of cars and stunning environments. One more for the casual crowd but fun nonetheless, a fantastic celebration of car culture",1
14,"Imagine you're working in a 9-5 corporate job, you're done with your work, you come back home, log onto Steam, see your games list for 5 seconds, buy a game on sale that you're never going to play and then switch off your PC and go to a bar. While having a drink, you think of the good times when games used to be fun and authentic. But then you tell yourself, the problem isn't the games, its you. ""Its not that games aren't fun anymore, you have gotten older"".

And then I play forza horizon 4. And suddenly I can't wait to get myself home after work. Do you have any idea how precious that feeling is ? The feeling that you are actually immersed in the protagonist' shoes. I find myself in anticipation and excitement for the new adventures that are waiting for me, I think while driving back home....""Where is this story headed ? What new places and characters I will meet ?"" And lets not talk about the characters. I thought myself as a guy who's dead on the inside and somehow these characters made me laugh, chuckle and empathise at the same time. I haven't felt these feelings for a game since 2008 when I played games such as Final Fantasy 12, Metal Gear Solid 3. Was I wrong to think that I was the problem and not the gaming industry that's shelling out mediocre AAA games with no memorable characters or storyline ?

And I got this game for 15$. 15$ !! And that includes the DLC ! I honestly feel I looted these amazing devs. And I paid twice for games that are not even worth playing. 23 hours in and I still haven't scratched the surface of the story. The side quests are actually fun. I find myself doing the side quests more because its feels like I am watching another episode of the ""cars TV show"". I love this open world, I actually take my time wandering around and exploring every nook and cranny. I haven't done this since need for speed most wanted. I look at some distant island or mountain that I find interesting and I decide to just walk there just for the fun of it. That's how beautiful this Open World this. This is Open World game done right.

Thank you playground games. You guys are a gem. I know its 2 years late and I don't know why it took me 2 years to play this, but better late than never.",1
15,"[h1]Finally, Microsoft makes the move[/h1]

Been laying my eyes on FH4 for a long time, just waiting for them to release on steam platform. There‚Äôs no way I will ever buying games from Microsoft store. 

FH4 is probably the best arcade racing out there, not even nfs will come close to it. The game right now has sheer amount of content since it first release. Lots of cars, map is huge and packed in lot of nice details. Wants street racing? You got it. Off road? There you go. You can also relax and coast around in your favourite classic car, exploring the country side. Climbing rough terrain with 4x4 to the top of the mountain with your friend. The game has almost near to infinite replayability.

The lightning and reflections on cars looks gorgeous for game that was released two years ago. There‚Äôs also a seasonal rotation that change how the map looks once in a while to keep the game fresh. 

The optimization is good, even with my old potato 1660ti, im able to run at steady 70-90fps with mix of ultra to high settings. Although I encountered stutter during the cutscene transition every time I finished a race, but I believe devs are working on it since it‚Äôs a known issue. 

Now, the [b]price[/b]. A lot of people are excited when Microsoft announced FH4 are finally coming to steam. But when the game was released, people were greeted by the overpriced tag instead. Luckily in my region, the price of the game is almost 50% cheaper on steam when compared to Microsoft store. 

Hope Microsoft brings the price down for other region as well. Let more people have the chance to enjoy this masterpiece",1

20,"I have a love-hate relationship with this game. On one hand it's the most fun simcade driving game that I've had the pleasure of playing over the last few years, with hours upon hours of content, amazing graphics, and a really good car selection.

On the other, it's straight up THE most miserable multiplayer experience I have ever had with any game in my life.

Case 1: At it's worst, you can wait up to 15 MINUTES to get into one match, which takes lasts like 3 to 7 minutes at most. And THEN the game might just spontaneously crash whenever it feels like it. It seems to have gotten better since the Steam launch

Case 2:
I wasn't able to play with my friends (who bought the game on the Microsoft Store) for 3 WEEKS because the DNS servers were down, and any support tickets were marked as ""answered"" even if the issue wasn't solved. Instead of actually fixing the problem, which was clearly on their end, their support deflected instead and put the blame on the players themselves. Only when the servers went down completely and enough people started complaining about it (after 2 weeks since the issue has started) they actually started doing something, and even then, it took them one week straight to actually fix the problem.

Treat this review as a ""neutral rating"", since Steam doesn't have that option.
Ultimately, the core gameplay is so much fun that I would still highly recommend this game if you're into racing games. Just don't set your expectations for the multiplayer aspect of this game too high because you're just going to end up as disappointed as I am.

",1
21,"[h1] DO NOT BUY THE STEAM VERSION [/h1]

1. It is severely overpriced and the price tag isn't worth it, either buy a key for the Microsoft Store or buy Game Pass. (Since people are saying ""the price is normal in my country"" I should probably state the fact that I'm talking about countries that use the Euro currency.)
2. A lot of issues with this lazy port that no one seemed to have quality tested or bug checked including but not limited to: 

- No Audio during intro.
- Steering wheel support is broken.
- No Impulse triggers on Xbox controllers.
- Random stuttering and microstuttering.
- No cross-save support (due to limitations).
- Insanely high price in Europe.
- Crashing during launching and gameplay.
- Insanely laggy cutscene transitions.
- Cursor occasionally vanishes.
- V-sync / refresh rate issue if you have multiple monitors with different refresh rates.

PC Specs: (perfectly capable of running the game, runs flawlessly on ultra on the Microsoft Store) i7 6700K, 16GB 3200Mhz, GTX 1060 6GB, 1TB SSD

I requested a refund for the game 10 minutes before I would no longer be able to because I thought to myself if this price tag with all these issues justifies owning the game on steam, it really doesn't. Hopefully the developers fix this in the future, I will be buying the Ultimate Edition on the MS Store for the price I paid for this from a keysite or by using the Game Pass deal.

Otherwise apart from all the issues with this Steam port, the game is a fantastic arcade racing experience for everyone to enjoy and one of the best racing games of all time in my opinion and it's just really sad and disappointing that this port is this awful compared to Microsoft's other Steam ports such as Sea of Thieves and Halo...

P.S: Who at the Microsoft sales department for this game decided that $59,99 = ‚Ç¨69,99???? ‚Ç¨70 is $83.44.....

EDIT: 

The Steam version isn't even worth when it will more than likely go on a discount for European Euro zone users because the price will drop from 70 euros down to 50 euros and you STILL get no DLC...

According to some users who played the game previously, the game does not receive active bug fix development or bugfixes and rather leaves the game in a broken state for a month or two until the next major patch comes along.

The Forza Horizon 4 issue tracker added the Steam version to the list of issues so it can be tracked, only a few of the issues I listed in the review above are actually mentioned by the dev team to be a ""known"" issue. You can check out the page yourself.

UPDATE FROM MICROSOFT:

(Taken from onmsft)

[quote] Update 2:30PM PT: We‚Äôve received a statement from a Microsoft spokesperson confirming the issues in the Steam version of Forza Horizon 4, but the developer of the game is working on it. ‚ÄúThe Forza team is aware of issues related to stuttering and wheel support and keeps players updated on progress via the Forza Support page. We‚Äôre always listening to the community and looking for ways to evolve the game but have nothing further to share at this time,‚Äù the Microsoft spokesperson said. [/quote]",0

FH4 is the best arcade racing game. It has a lot content, great selection of cars, fun gameplay, good controls and physics.

I'm extremely happy that Forza Horizon 4 is finally on Steam, I wanted to play this game for years. But xbox app was testing my patience.

It's an open world racing game. I guess by cranking up the difficulty and realism settings you could bring it closer to sim-cade level, but mostly it's arcade, a fun one, where laws of physics still exist and different cars handle differently.

A while ago when there were mainly arcade games on the market I always wanted more simulators or something arcade but which makes sense when it comes to handling. But then the age of simulators started. Sure they're fun, but they're tiring while Forza is relaxing in a way. Well, you can make it relaxing or challenging. It's the most fun racing game on the market.

Car handling is awesome. The weight transfer physics work which is especially useful in dirt racing, you can drift which requires some effort unlike in other games. It's just that awesome feeling, fun and slightly realistic.

Car selection is amazing. Everyone will find a car they adore. There are hundreds of cars, something like 700 maybe? Cars have classes and the selection is very diverse. From vintage cars to modern supercars, from regular road cars to rally cars or even trucks or vans. There are even Lego and hot Wheels cars. Just insane.
Maybe one downside is that you get a bunch of cars really quickly so there's no sense of progression because you're being given the fastest cars in the first hours of the game. I prefer starting with regular cars and make my way up to earn faster, more expensive cars. Fortunately you can choose whatever car in exhibition races but still it lack progression.

So you race in England. At first it's slightly confusing to drive on the wrong lane, of course you can drive however you like but still coming from other games like ETS2 it's a bit confusing, especially the roundabouts. Not in a bad way though.
The map is huge and very diverse. Highways, dirt roads, small roads, forests, mountains, lakes, city, everything you want is there for you to explore. And exploring is fun. There are hidden barns and other collectables. While barns are fun, they give you a new car but other collectables are just there for the sake of...collectables. But again ‚Äì not a bad thing, some of them are fun to find. One of the fun collectable types are beauty spots. You see a beautiful cut-scene of the area/object.

The game revolves around competing in a festival. There are various challenges which give you rewards when you complete them. Most of the time you'll need to win races but there are other challenges, like speed traps where you must drive as fast as possible or the ones where you need to jump off a ramp and be in the air for as long as possible.
But of course racing is the most important here and you have few types of races. Circuit racing, point A to B racing. But that's not all. There A to B races where you need to follow the road and there are ones where you just need to get to finish line as quick as possible by driving wherever you like, no rules. Team racing where one team competes against drivatar team or other players. There are also races against trains or planes. On top of that there are taxi missions. Which bring us to story events. Those are events/races with some story to it. They're fun and challenging and will keep you occupied for a while.

Now multiplayer activities. Racing is obviously one of them but there's also capture the flag where you must carry the flag to destination and other team needs to stop you. Matches where infected team need to touch other cars to infect them. Protect the king matches which is similar. And the most surprising one ‚Äì battle royale.
There's also ranked play. It has stricter rules like you can't hit the walls because you get penalized.

But it's not all multiplayer only. Amount of single player content is insane. You can choose to race solo on your chosen difficulty level, a coop race against drivatars and story missions.
The game basically gives you a choice how you want to play it.

You can customize your character and own a house, multiple houses which serve as your garage and home where you can tune your cars and your appearance.
You can also tune your cars accordingly to race you're going to participate. Don't want that? Just download the setup straight from the game. You can apply liveries to your cars by creating your own where the only limit is your imagination or just download a livery.
To get new stuff you spin a fortune wheel and rewards are ranging from money and clothes to some cool cars. You earn wheelspins by playing the game.

You can drive anywhere, hit bushes, smaller trees, rocks, fences ‚Äì the environment is destructible. But the best part are seasons. There're four seasons which change over time. Each season has its challenges to compete for you. And season changes could even change your driving. On winter it could be harder to drive but lakes are frozen so you can have fun on the lake. Seasons along with dynamic weather change the map drastically.

This is one of the best looking games. Seasons change the map so much that it feels fresh each time. All the seasons are absolutely beautiful.
Cars look amazing and they're all are fully modelled. You can look closely at every part of the car.
Environments look great. Distant objects are lower quality but overall the game looks stunning.
There's also a photo mode where you can take beautiful pictures. But I find most filters pretty poor so it's better to tune the colors by yourself.

When the game looks that good I don't expect it to run smoothly. But this is probably the best performing game currently in my library. Runs on max graphics, 80-100fps, smooth as butter. I'm playing on 5800x, 2070s, 32GB @3440x1440.
There's native ultrawide support. Although cut-scenes are cropped for some reason.

It has a lot of loading screens so I suggest to install this to m.2 ssd. They're usually short, 3 to 15 seconds, but there are so many of them that it gets annoying. It's especially annoying in mp because everyone must wait until the slowest PC will load the game which could take 15 minutes. How fun is it to wait 15 minutes for a 5min race?
I noticed many people complaining about stuttering cut-scenes. But cut-scenes are actually loading screens.

One more minor annoying thing is unskippable voice when you open the map and there's something new on it. It tells you about new activities but after 20th time I just don't want to hear it anymore it's the most annoying thing in the whole game besides clueless online players.

Sound design is perfect. Cars sound great, the festival site feels alive.
There're radio stations so most people will find something to listen to but t lack a metal station.

Overall an extremely good racing game for anyone who at least slightly enjoys racing games. It's great for everyone's taste due to plenty of different activities and modes to play.
I suggest buying the ultimate edition. It only lacks two dlc's. Not at full price obviously.

24,"People say Forza is a series with strong character. Basically, today‚Äôs racing title has two ends ‚Äì it is either arcade racing, such as NFS and The Crew, or hardcore car sim like Assetto Corsa or Codemasters‚Äô racing games. While the Forza Horizon series (I never played Forza Motorsport) still belongs to arcade racing, it reaches a perfect balance between arcade and realistic racing. It has a fair amount of reality, while players can still jump right in anytime, unlike car sim titles where people must spend time learning mechanics and control methods before they can play properly. This is the unique character of Forza Horizon and its greatest charisma in my opinion.

There is another feature worth highlight. The game offers lots of assistance and setting options, and various difficulties with reasonable scale to customize the experience and cater to different audiences. You can make the game more or less arcade/realistic depending on your liking. For me personally, I started off with many assistances on, then I gradually turned them off and bumped up the difficulty as I got more familiar with the game. As I was doing so, I can feel myself getting better at the game, which is a great feeling I never experienced in other racing games.

Forza Horizon 4 is an open-world title. It can‚Äôt be compared to open-world RPGs like The Witcher 3 and Skyrim, but as a racing game, I think it is great. The world has diversified locations, different weather and seasons, and is packed with stuff to do. Although I am only interested in racing events and dislike various speed and drift challenges, it is nice to see it includes so many different types of events. It took me approximately 60 hours to get first place in all fixed racing events (I am an average racer). I think it is fair despite I hope I can race for 80-100 hours.

I don‚Äôt have real complaints about the game, but I can certainly whine a bit. Firstly, the Steam version doesn‚Äôt have the great rumble trigger feature. I have tried several methods, but I can‚Äôt enable it with my Xbox Series controller (Windows Store version works fine). Secondly, the game is not immune to difficulty spikes despite having a reasonable difficulty scale. It feels odd but fortunately, it is rare. Lastly, I wish the game could have a large music collection. I disabled it most of the time because I am so fed up with listening to several songs over and over.

I am not a big racing fan who has played tons of racing titles, but among all I played, Forza Horizon 4 is the best, period. And I think the series is probably my endgame racing title because the driving feels so great that I don‚Äôt want to play others that feel different. I am hype up for the upcoming Horizon 5.",1

29,"I‚Äôve always had a soft spot for British cities, towns, villages and countryside. As someone who is a fan of open-world games, and enjoys an arcade racing game now and then, I definitely find [I]Forza Horizon 4[/I] an appealing title. It‚Äôs set in a highly condensed, simplified version of central and northern Great Britain that includes Edinburgh, the Scottish Highlands, the Lake District, Ambleside, Broadway, and Bamburgh. This picturesque, yet uncommon, setting for an open-world game, makes [I]FH4[/I] even more special.

Although [I]Forza Horizon 5[/I] was released past November, [I]FH4[/I] is still a relevant game. At the time of this review, the [I]FH4[/I] community is still quite active, with at least 20 players -- sometimes as many as 50 -- online in my sessions. With all additional official content for [I]FH4[/I] having been released, you‚Äôll know exactly what you‚Äôll get when you buy this game. When it comes down to it, your preference in scenery will be the major determining factor in deciding between [I]FH4[/I] and [I]FH5[/I].

[I]FH4[/I] is a playground with plenty of game modes to unlock and access. Aside from an impressive tutorial that guides you through various types of races, terrains, seasons, and weather conditions in the first several minutes, you pretty much have free reins on your driving adventure from the start. The action in [I]FH4[/I] centres on:
[LIST]
[*]story-based challenges called Horizon Stories, with The Stunt Driver and British Racing Green being my favourites;
[*]races (Road, Dirt, Street, Cross Country, and Showcase), with racing/chasing a train in a 1959 Ford Anglia like in [I]Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets[/I] being most memorable;
[*]PR stunts (speed traps and zones, stunt jumps, drifting zones); and
[*]events (live in-game challenges titled Forzathon Live, as well as daily and weekly challenges).
[/LIST]

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2684469342

There is also a battle royale mode called The Eliminator, as well as a series of user-created challenges named Super7. Mechanically inclined players can also tune their vehicles, artistic ones can design liveries for their cars, construction oriented folks can devise new racing routes, and shutterbugs can capture their favourite cars at eye-catching moments using the in-game camera mode. All can share their creations with the [I]FH4[/I] community to enjoy. [I]FH4[/I] has something for everybody regardless of your levels of enthusiasm and skill for driving and racing games. It even offers to adjust the difficulty level based on your recent racing performances.

If you wish, you can simply explore the over 300 roads on the map. I spent my first 30 hours or so mainly doing that, plus triggering speed traps and zones, doing stunt jumps, destroying smashable signs, and seeking and photographing as many of the over 700 featured cars as I could. I‚Äôve truly enjoyed the freedom with which I had just exploring the in-game world by car, without ever worrying about the police, griefers, and dying. This is something that even [I]Grand Theft Auto[/I] couldn‚Äôt offer.

If that‚Äôs not enough, there are the expansion packs: [I]Fortune Island[/I] and [I]LEGO Speed Champions[/I]. The former transports you to a mountainous island with sheer cliffs and extreme weather, and the latter to the joyful LEGO Valley, where structures are made of LEGO bricks. If you enjoy driving or racing games with challenging terrain and treasure hunting, I think you‚Äôll enjoy [I]Fortune Island[/I]. I recommend [I]LEGO Speed Champions[/I] to all because it‚Äôs just so whimsical and delightful to see LEGO vehicles go toe-to-toe against real cars.

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2703143656

[I]FH4[/I] employs tricks like endowed progress effect, artificial scarcity, randomized reward, and leaderboards to make gameplay addictive. You‚Äôre awarded Skill or Influence Points for almost everything you do. Skill Points convert to Perks for your cars, and Influence Points unlock new races, events and prizes. Winning races and completing events will earn you Credits, which you use to buy new cars and houses. At times, you‚Äôll get the chance to win (rare) prizes in Wheelspins. With these reward systems in place, [I]FH4[/I] is more fun and addictive than I had initially imagined.

Don‚Äôt want to wait to win or buy a specific car? You can see if one of the several DLC car packs has it. I decided to buy [I]Forza Horizon 4: Ultimate Edition[/I] mainly because I wanted the [I]LEGO Speed Champions[/I] expansion pack and the Best of Bond Car pack. I don‚Äôt regret my decision, for this is the closest I‚Äôll ever get to driving cross Britain in a 1964 Aston Martin DB5, even though it doesn‚Äôt come with Q‚Äôs enhancements.

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2684410944

What keeps [I]FH4[/I] interesting and dynamic after all these hours is that the game changes season every real-time week. Each season comes new events and challenges, such as being able to drag race on a frozen lake in winter. If anything, [I]FH4[/I] has so much content that the game‚Äôs menu and map can get overwhelming, and disorienting. It‚Äôs one of the game‚Äôs few shortcomings. The other is the absence of a custom radio station, which is a real shame since I‚Äôd love to play soundtrack from James Bond films as I trek across the land in the DB5.

Playing [I]FH4[/I] has been an entertaining way to bid 2021 farewell, and welcome 2022. At the time of this review, I‚Äôve clocked in just under 80 hours of playing time, and I foresee putting in many more in the weeks to come. Needless to say, I highly recommend this game to anyone who enjoys open-world games and arcade racing games. While the Ultimate Edition may not be for you, I think the base game and at least a couple of the DLCs are worth checking out.",1
30,"This is probably the best racing game ever existed, however Steam port was outsourced to amateurs who did a terrible job at virtually everything on every technical level. 
Stutters in gameplay and cutscenes, unplayable without V-sync. Framedrops are horrible. Sometimes it freezes down to 35FPS. Loading scenes are literal slideshow. And yes, game installed on NVME.
Random crashes. Game can work for 5-6 hours and than freeze in Garage and crash without any errors. 
Some people report that game not launch at all or straight up crash after intro. 
This is the most severe issues, but there is much much more technical difficulties in this version.
All this problems absent in MS Store version, where this game runs perfectly without any single issue with rock solid framerate.
Avoid Steam release as a plague, save your money and buy this awesome game in Microsoft Store, because all this problems i mentioned probably never going to be fixed and this port will be abandoned in this horrendous state, since the job was done by hired outsource company and i highly doubt that MS is going to pay them for fixing all this mess, because they already have superior PC version in their own Store which is handled by Playground Games themselves.
Too bad it turned out that way, however it was predictable.
UPD: After 2 whole weeks, we saw no fixes, no patches, no nothing so far. Developers show no feedback. They tried to fix something with 430mb patch which broken the game even more, so they rolled it back. Absolute disaster. This people deserve no money. I will keep updating this further.
UPD2: They released ""patch"" that fixed nothing. Wow...
UPD3: Revisited the game nearly a YEAR after Steam release, and guess what ? Its STILL a stutterfest, nearly unplayable. 2 hours after launch and game starts leaking memory. What did i expected anyway ?",0

32,"This is a negative review not because I think it's a bad game (far from it, I'm loving every moment so far) but because I have to vent about the most irritating thing this game has: built-in, unskippable trailers for its DLC, which will play in frequent intervals without any prompting from you. The notion that they need to force me to watch an advert for more DLC after I've bought the game is frankly insulting. This is a terrible marketing decision and shows complete disdain for their player-base, from a marketing stand-point at least.

Honestly, if the trailers were skippable, I wouldn't be worried, but the fact that the game forces you to sit through it (or at least let it run, often several in a row, while you go off and get coffee or whatever) before you're 'allowed' to continue playing the game is completely ridiculous.",0
33,"Cool game and finally it's on steam, but the price is way too high. 100‚Ç¨ for the ultimate edition is a bad joke, and you dont even get all DLCs for that price.",0
34,"As seen by a casual gamer with a life long passion for rally and racing games that enjoys playing on keyboard and external camera view.



Forza Horizon 4 is one of the best car racing games I have ever played!!

Strong :
‚úî Insane variety and list of cars!!!!!
‚úî Physics and graphics are super well done, the environment is gorgeous and the most mind-blowing thing is that every week the map changes to each one of the 4 seasons including all sorts of weather conditions
‚úîbest rain I have ever experienced in a racing/rally game to date. Rain has actual sense of depth just like IRL when you can see it fall on the street or on lakes from distance. it's not just a simple animation layer on your screen any more. ‚úî Also water drops are actually dynamically and individually rendered on your car - which is a detail that blew me away. ‚úî Even wetness on the tarmac is interacting with your tires going through it (sound and splash effect depending the amount of water)
‚úî Car design is absolutely magnificent. The attention to the detail is insane, even the car lights are done with so much detail. The detail is so great that at some moments you will be able to even notice the speedometers and RPM-meters animate and display fully real time accurate measurements while driving with external cam view ( ! ).
‚úî Satisfying amount of car customization. Not too much or chaotic and not too little. Just about right. From engine upgrades to body paints.
‚úî Pretty cool voice acting and some times a nice drop of humor. also a good cameo for top gear in there. some of the special missions include some very enjoyable historical and factual story telling about some specific cars.
‚úî Some secret specials here and there like a Halo themed mission that lets you drive the Warthog (you can also obtain if for your self when you can afford it), and a head to head that can let you unlock the QUADRA TURBO-R V-TECH from Cyberpunnk2077!
‚úî Not much for dirt effects but splashing through water is extremely satisfying.
‚úî The music selections are so damn awesome and some tracks are so memorable I eventually found them on Spotify and added them to my favorites!
‚úî SH*TTONES of things to do. Like seriously from the standard race events to the weekly events to custom events created by other players!!!
‚úî The 2 map expansions are actually worth playing and super cool to experience!!


Weak :
‚ùåRewind button response will fail way too many times
‚ùåIf you select retry at the end of an event the loading time is going to ridiculously slow (extra ‚ùå given here because some times the reload finished and the car falls through the map) in order to avoid this either restart an event before you reach the finish line. or simply collect the whatever reward you would get, go through the event scores and restart it once you are on free-roam again (that's seriously faster than selecting ""retry"")
‚ùåtiny detail but it's slightly off-putting: old design flaw where the shadow of the tires does not actually start from the point of contact to the floor allowing light to be seen under the tires. This ""floating"" tire effect is such a very very old design flaw, i was surprised to come across it a couple of time.
‚ùåCar damage is limited to some very very basic visual scratches. best thing you can see is loosing a mirror or a spoiler (in case you have any) or some mad-protectors depending the design but that's it.




I am left without words to describe how much fun I had playing this game. My time tracker speaks for itself and I'm not into any repetitive gameplay. It's super rare for me to reach anything above 100h for a car racing game. This is a truly awesome game with an open world design that keeps things fresh with an easy UI/UX design and the diversity of the environment combined with the seasons made me not get bored to even drive from one corner of the map to the other without fast traveling. From super cars to rally cars, from hyper cars to drift cars and trucks. This was a real journey and I will look forward to the next title from this studio for sure!!

This is hands down recommended!


PS: note to self, it's amazing how great the graphical details are evolving in racing games. i'm keen to experience more!",1

If you're like me and eyeballing the new Forza 5, don't overlook the most recent predecessor. Four is on sale now at 65% off for everything. I've not had it too long, and it still has a lot of replay value. It's the best racing game I've ever played, hands down.  Now is the best time to buy in at these sale prices.

39,"I have an awfully hard love/hate relationship with this game. On one hand it's beautiful, has tons of awesome cars and can be really fun if played with friends. But it comes at a huge price - quite literally in Europe as it costs 69.99 ‚Ç¨ in contrast to 59.99 $ in the US. The correct price according to current exchange rates would be around 50 ‚Ç¨, this is ridiculous. It's even worse if you remember that this game came out over 2 years ago and they still demand the same 99.99 ‚Ç¨ for the Ultimate Edition without any discount. 

Apart from the pricing the game also has the worst support I ever encountered. My first ticket for a crashing game after release was answered 8 months later, my two more recent tickets about a translation error and a problem with the Forza Hub were both answered with ""yeah we know about this and are [i]investigating[/i]"" and were closed without fixing anything.

Last but not least not offering the possibility to transfer a savegame after investing 300+ hours on the Microsoft Store version even if you use the same Microsoft account is such a bad move for veterans who were actually willing to pay the price again. 

All in all I'm happy that MS made the move to Steam and I'm looking forward to the next Forza Motorsport release, but I'll skip this for now and I wouldn't recommend anyone to spend the full price on this game since you basically need to buy the Ultimate Edition for access to all available cars.

Bonus for those who are curious: It doesn't work on Linux with Steam Play right now and probably never will as it still completely relies on the Xbox infrastructure.",0
40,"The game rewards exploration and silliness just as much as careful racing. Like the ""Burnout"" and ""Need for Speed"" games, ""Forza Horizon 4"" encourages plenty of ""arcade-style"" car gameplay. ...

45,"Its one of the best racing games out there if not the best on pc, but port to steam is really really bad. I have played windows edition for more than 200 hrs but on steam there are several issues that are not fixed till this date and most frustrating of them all is crashing when playing with friends and stuttering. I dont recommend this game till atleast these two of many issues solved first on steam. Still in June my review remains the same as  I'd rather wait for forza horizon 5 tbh than buying this game even in sale because of the attention of developers to the game at current stage.
After Update:
Its still crashes after some time as issue is still not fixed with season 34, even tho there r many reasons for crashes but sometimes these short term fixes help- 
1. Make a game run as administrator 
2. Disable any overlay while in game including nvidia and steam overlay
3. Disable Windows Defender 
4. Dont use discord while starting or join a session of friend
5. Check xbox network connectivity from settings->gaming->xbox networking and if says 
    cannot connect to xbox live servers then look for online fixes. ps- u will find them easily as 
    they are common in microsoft games.
6. Go to settings->System->About->Advanced System settings->Advanced and then change 
    paging size for driver C to 16 to 4096
These are fixes if game crashes after joining a friends session or after few minutes of playing",1

47,"I am a 54 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single father to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas in 2021 from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 40 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching Faide montages on YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories",1
48,"I own an awful lot of racing games. The reason I have so many is because I have always been searching for the perfect blend of fun, difficulty, speed, vehicles, track  variety and the feeling of actually driving on the open road. Sure plenty of driving games offer one, two or maybe  even three of these traits however Forza Horizon 4 has ticked every single one of those boxes and then added some boxes on top. This game is an absolute phenomenon.
There are hours and hours of gorgeous driving game play here. The season changes are fantastic and really make a difference to the way the cars handle and the scenery changes dramatically for each season. The game fits midway between sim and arcade which is my personal sweet spot. There's plenty of opportunity to customise your cars with upgrades, body parts and custom paint jobs and tune the hell out of each car if that is your thing. Me, I just love the pure feel of the open road and the fact each car's cockpit is modelled is just astounding. If you love racing games then you owe it to yourself to grab this one, end of.",1
49,"[h1] Intro [/h1]
Since I've never owned a console, I had little to no experience playing a Forza game. So when this game launched on Steam I had to try it out. Many describe this game as a 'Car-PG', which is a very accurate description. It includes subtle lifestyle features like character customization and purchasing homes, reminiscent of the Test Drive Unlimited series. Unlike other arcade games of its era it chooses to have a mix between a simulation and an arcade experience; providing casual players a simple experience while having the more technical aspects and complexity available to the hardcore players such as with the Tuning system.

[h1]Graphics and Audio [/h1]
This game has to be one of the most stunning looking games out there. The game looks excellent for its relatively modest performance requirements. It manages to run at 60 fps on High-Ultra settings on my 6 year old PC at the time of this review. Subsequently the game produces some of the most realistic screenshots using the in-game photo mode. I have personally taken hundreds of photos in-game and still keep taking more frequently. The lighting, weather and season system keeps the game always looking fresh. Using 12K recordings of real UK skies they were able to achieve realistic looking skies and lighting through around 300 unique weather and lighting presets. The map manages to recreate the UK well through a condensed scaled down map capturing the essence and the greatest vistas the UK can offer.
The SFX are mediocre in this game. The sound quality is not exceptional and nor are there many of them to provide unique sounds to every car in the game. The engine sounds become forgettable after spending a few hours playing the game since a lot of cars sound very similar. The music selection in this game, on the other hand, is brilliant. Providing users with 6 different radio stations featuring genres such as Pop, Hip-Hop, Rock, Electronic and Classical. All of which are perfectly curated to provide the best driving experience. However, the limited number of songs does make it repetitive and make you want to disable the radio and put on your own songs in the background after a while.

[h1] Gameplay [/h1]

The simcade approach they've chosen to go with provides the right experience for all kinds of players. The variety in cars is one of the standout features of the game. While it includes the usual supercars, hypercars and sports cars it also includes many common everyday vehicles you'd expect to see. The game also provides different experiences in the form of Road Racing, Off-Road Racing, Drag Racing, Drifting etc. The tuning and livery design systems are designed very well and the game allows the community to share their own designs and tunes for anyone to use which reward the creators as well.
Probably the biggest gameplay feature of the game is the live service update system through 'Forzathon'. The game is divided into 4 seasons which last a week each and 4 seasons make up a 'Series' which lasts a month. Through Forzathon, new content is delivered to players through the form of new events, cars and other items. This is a big reason why the game managed to keep players around for years.

[h1] Campaign and Progression [/h1]
For new players who are not familiar with Forza Horizon games, it can be quite daunting to get into. Since the game takes an open approach, letting players play the way they want to since the very start, meaningful progression takes a back seat. One can start driving the fastest hyper cars within a few hours of starting the game, providing very little incentive to spend any time in lower tier cars which takes away from the experience the devs intended to provide. Another difficulty new players can experience is the lack of guidance in the campaign. Since the game never pushes you towards any activities it makes it difficult to know what the end goal is in the game.

[h1] Multiplayer [/h1]
The multiplayer experience in this game is far from perfect. Online races are riddled with rammers who create a bad experience for players looking to race cleanly. Although many updates have been made to the game since launch to remedy this issue, it has not completely fixed it. The game also discourages the use of its vast collection of cars and limiting your options to a few 'meta cars'. These meta cars provide a distinct advantage to players who use them. Leaving players to choose between using the cars they want and losing frequently regardless of skill, or using one of the meta cars and playing lobbies with every player using the same car and occasionally winning.
The Horizon Life feature is a well made one. It puts you into an online lobby with real players who show up in free roam. Players have the option to create 'convoys', so they can join their friends and play around in free roam as well as initiate different events.

[h1] Which edition should I get? [/h1]
For long time racing fans who love to put tens or hundred of hours into a game, the ultimate edition is typically the best option. It provides access to the 2 DLC expansions as well as a large number of cars and other minor benefits. The DLCs can add around 10-20 hours of content each. For more casual players the standard edition is a good deal letting players who really enjoy the game opt in to buy the DLC later if they want to.
Basically, skip the Deluxe edition and you can't go wrong with it.

[h1] Conclusion [/h1]
FH4 captures what made the series successful by providing a fun experience to casual and experienced players at the same time. It also delivers an excellent graphical experience while being a well optimized game running on older/slower hardware. The multiplayer experience of the game is far from perfect. While Horizon Life works very well, letting you join other players, Online Adventures on the other hand are plagued with rammers and meta cars taking away the diversity in the game in terms of cars. 
Overall the game provides a unique and relaxing experience to players who love driving, featuring a wide variety of cars, beautiful vistas and the perfect soundtrack to accompany it which is its greatest strength.",1
50,"Is it a good arcade racer?
Yes.
Is it worth the price for a 3 year old game?
No, absolutely not.

I've played it a bunch on game pass, and it doesn't have cross save, making it worthless if you already play it on the windows store as you'll have to start from scratch. Also, starting at ¬£55 for a 3 year old game is insulting to say the least, with the dlc you're looking at well over ¬£100. If you want to play it, go on game pass and then maybe buy it outright when on sale, you'll save a lot of money and the game is exactly the same on either platform, with cross play support.

I would not have bought it here myself, but I was gifted it by a friend, so I'm not loosing anything. Still, even free, with no cross save I feel short changed.",0

55,"My god, finally a masterpiece on Steam.

After hundreds of hours played in the Microsoft store, I can certainly say that this car game is without a doubt the best I have ever played, with perfect arcade gameplay, phenomenal graphics and a breathtaking soundtrack for each race.
The game is so diverse, playing on land, tar, snow, sand, day and night.

Everything in this game makes sense, the car buying and selling system is also very well executed, the demand for abandoned cars is worth it.

I don't have much to say when you find a game so perfect, so well done and very well configured.

Any GTX1000 series card can handle the job with good performance and a breathtaking image.

This game from 0 to 10 would definitely be 11.

Magnificent.",1
56,"This is obviously very subjective, but here‚Äôs my review.  Spoiler Alert: 9.5/10 from me.

Overview:
I was a PlayStation gamer for many years prior to branching out to PC gaming a few years ago, so I never got to experience the Forza games until recently.  Forza Horizon 5 was my introduction to the series.  I really enjoyed it and scored it an 8/10 in my Steam review.  I then decided to try out Forza Horizon 4, and I just love it, can‚Äôt get enough.  FH4 is a fantastic game and far superior to FH5 in my opinion.  

Driving / Difficulty:
I generally opt for more simulator-type driving games, i.e. realistic driving.   It‚Äôs safe to say that this game definitely does not fall in to that category, instead leaning more towards the arcade style... there‚Äôs nothing wrong with that at all!  There are 8 difficulty (Drivatar) levels to choose from, ranging from from new player to unbeatable.  This allows the game to cater to most skill levels‚Ä¶ unless you‚Äôre either really bad, or play like Jarno Opmeer or SuperGT (lucky you!!).  There‚Äôs also a huge amount of assists which you can opt for, such as, auto transmission, TCR, STM, ABS, assisted steering, assisted braking, damage on/off, tyre wear on/off, and driving line.  Whatever way you choose to play is up to you, but there are options to suit almost everyone.  

Gameplay:
The FH4 world is outstandingly beautiful.  The landscape is stunning, and I love how it changes through the seasons.  The attention to detail in the world design is superb.  The story was‚Ä¶ meh.  Not memorable, with some very tedious moments and a few non-skippable cutscences.  But it was more interesting that FH5‚Äôs story imo.  The game has heaps self-contained storylines and businesses too which are fun, a nice challenge, and encourage you to explore parts of the map you may not otherwise experience.  There's a vast range of cars to earn (~500) by completing various races, events, stories, accolades etc.  You can also win cars, money, cosmetic items etc. through Wheelspins.  The game is very generous with how easy Wheelspins are to earn, especially when compared with how stingy many other game series can be.  Cars can be customised via upgrades and tuning options.  These are great to experiment with to find the right set-up for your favourite cars and to fine tune to suit specific types of races.  I love this feature personally, but for those who don't, there's also a feature that allows tunes made by other members of the community be downloaded.  You can also create your own paintjobs and liveries with infinite possibilities.  There‚Äôs endless amounts of stuff to do, along with seasonal (weekly) championships, challenges, and events.  I haven‚Äôt even mentioned all the PvP and user-created challenges - people's creativity will never cease to amaze me.  You‚Äôll never be bored!!  After a hard day at work / uni, it's just nice (therapeutic even!) to drive around like a complete lunatic destroying fences, trees, drifting, racing at stupidly high speed, doing massive jumps etc. all while earning points and combos to gain fast XP.  It's even more fun with friends!  The tracks are decent and offer lots of variety in racing styles from drifting to cross-country to circuit to rally.  

Performance:
I run everything on max settings, and FH4 genuinely looks phenomenal.  A number of the negative reviews I've read mention issues with performance.  The game runs fine for me, with just a couple of minor stuttering issues and one or two freezes in ~100 hours of gameplay.  I‚Äôve had no connection issues to friends / other players either.

TL;DR ‚Äì FANTASTIC game if you're looking for a fun, open-world driving experience.  Lots of styles of racing and tonnes of cars to choose from.  Looks incredible.  Lots to do.  9.5/10 for the fun factor.

57,"I am having extremely fun, and I really enjoy the game a lot. I would highly recommend the game in a positive way, since it's the best driving game I have played since the early The Crew days. But there is this one thing that really bothers me, and that's the pricing, like everyone else obviously. 

For a 3 year old game, it costs more than any other AAA game I have bought for YEARS. It's stupid expensive, and I did hesitate A LOT when buying it. Not just that, but trying to enter a specific race in the game it threw me into the store page for some reason, where I had to spend REAL money to OPEN a pack of vehicles to then be able to buy in the game, just to do a specific race. If there's one thing I can't stand, it's fucking micro transactions in an overpriced game.

A highly recommended game to everyone who enjoys racing games, but not until the price drop at least 40%, I'd even wait for more than that. So be patient, don't be like me, and wait for a sale, and you'll have the best racing game Steam has to offer in it's library.",0

[h1]Cons[/h1] 
- Driving in the left line
- Voice chat
 
[h1]Summary[/h1] 
Forza offers something for everyone, from muscle cars to Supersports and crazy modded offroads.
Very newbie friendly, you can just hand the controller/keyboard to someone who never played it and he will be drifting around Edinburgh in no time.
A great racing game that looks amazing, and is easy to play. Car controls are more on the arcade side but still satisfying.
Option to play any race with whatever car you like.
Multiplayer is still alive with many players and multiple modes to choose from.
The game runs exceptionally well even on mid-tier hardware and consoles.
Car customizations are going pretty deep, luckily you can just apply an already pre-configured preset made by someone else.
 
Unless you are from those few countries which do drive on the left you might have a hard time getting used to driving in the left line instead of the right line.
 
Voice chat can only be disabled from Xbox account privacy settings, not ingame‚Ä¶ making the multiplayer experience very frustrating with all the console players and open mics.
 
[b]Playtime:[/b] 100+ hours
 
[b]Achievements:[/b]  mostly easy, multiplayer achievements might be challenging (required DLCs: Fortune Island, LEGO@ Speed Champions)
One achievement requires you to log in at least once every 48 hours to complete the daily challenge for 28 days (4 weeks / 1 ingame season)
  
[b]Overall:[/b] 9/10 
  
[h2]Additional notes[/h2]
I recommend grabbing the Ultimate edition, it's worth it for the LEGO and Fortunate Island DLCs alone (a lot of extra content/money).
 
The most fun I ever had in a racing game so far. [i](from the little experience I had with Forza 5 I know that it will be most likely just a better version of 4)[/i]
[b]*Disclaimer[/b]
If you are looking for an extremely realistic game, this is not the one. Compared to Dirt Rally, Project Cars, etc., the driving experience is way different and made with controller/keyboard inputs in mind. At the same time, I did try to play with a wheel and I had a lot of fun, but I feel that I could have been way faster with a keyboard.
Also, there are no bikes, if you are into that.",1
59,"This is probably the best racing game I've played in a LONG while. I absolutely love it. Love the open world. Love car customization. Love the social aspect. Love the car handling and world.

HOWEVER.

I am giving this a negative review because no good Christian game of mine that I spend actual physical money to purchase a copy of better EVER give me unskippable FUCKING ads for their DLC after I do a race.",0

63,"Dear Mayor of Edinburgh,

we're a commitee of concerned citizen and we'd like to address a disturbing situation we're having in these months. It
seems that a group of reckless youngsters came here to party and drive devilish cars non-stop every day and night,
both in the city and our beloved countryside. 
They have no respect whatsoever for common places, private property and decor.
One night, while one of our elder families was retiring to bed, they've heard loud noises directly from the porch. Mr.Pinkerton almost had an heart attack, and while his wife was trying to help him some cars destroyed their garden and fence for no reason, probably driven under effect of drugs.It has been shocking, and it's not the only case.
We kindly ask you to put an end to this madness, and bring back the peaceful life we love and care about.

Sincerely,

Altough this is practically a sh1tpost review, i would hate to even mildly contribute to a purchase that anyone would regret later.

67,"Hear me out first: Forza Horizon 4 is bar none one of the best recent arcade racing games. I have over a thousand hours on it via my Xbox and definitely recommend it.  

[h1] BUT I DO NOT RECOMMEND THE STEAM VERSION FOR BOTH NEW AND RETURNING PLAYERS ALIKE [/h1]

For returning players that have already played FH4 on Xbox or Windows PC, there's no way to transfer over data from the last three years of gametime that we have, so unless you want to pay full price for a three year old game just to start again, I would recommend just going onto the Xbox app and downloading it with your old save there. 

For NEW PLAYERS, I'll ask again why you would want to spend full price on a three year old game, when you can just go onto the Xbox app if you have a windows 10 pc and get it for free using Game Pass. There are tons of ways to get game pass on the low, and even if you pay full price for it (Which you essentially need just to play online) it's still 75% less than what you have to pay here. 

All in all, Forza is a great franchise with amazing games. But why, three years later, would you put it out at full price while kneecapping the players who've been here since day one?",0

thanks for reading my review <3",1
71,"[h3][b]Wipes the floor with competition[/b][/h3]
[hr]Ever since I got my license, I refrained from taking mindless drives for a number of reasons. The gas price is steep. Dealers charge exorbitant rates for car parts. And most drivers see themselves as the second coming of Vin Diesel, making roads unsafe. So I had no choice but to satisfy the need in another way‚Äîthe [b]Forza[/b] way. [b]Playground Games[/b]‚Äô magnum opus is an elysian trip down the roads of the UK, like going full-throttle on a freeway with the radio up and windows down.[hr]
[h3][b]A racing bliss[/b][/h3]
You walk through the entrance. It‚Äôs a whole new world, a loud and brash festival for car lovers. Whether you‚Äôre here for celebration or competition, there‚Äôs a spot for you. The land down under was host to the previous Horizon festival, but this time, it has traveled all the way to the beautiful countryside of Britain. You‚Äôre an up-and-coming driver seeking fame, and the festival provides you the means to become one.

[b]Forza Horizon 4[/b] (FH4) is not in pursuit of a full-fledged campaign like the [b]Fast & Furious[/b]-wannabe games, which often sink into tedium. Instead, it comes with wholesome story threads to highlight the vastness of British engineering: the stunt driver, express delivery, and the world‚Äôs fastest taxi to name a few. The remaining ones, however, are designed more elegantly. A famous vlogger, for example, invites you to take iconic cars from other racing games out for a spin. A documentary that covers the automotive culture and history of Great Britain is in production, and you‚Äôre summoned to put cars from classics to modern-day beasts through their paces.

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2542406438
[h3][b]United Kingdom? No. Your kingdom[/b][/h3]
One look at the game‚Äôs map might have you thinking it‚Äôs big but not too big for the reputation of the franchise, though once your foot is on the pedal, everything is bound to change. You are free to drive as you please, and there are no stone-hard walls or invisible barriers to slow you down. It is a seamless world shared between its multiplayer and single-player. You can play it absolutely offline if you want, too.

You‚Äôre not forced to make ends meet by driving a single car until your wallet is heavy enough to afford a better one. Thankfully, a whopping number of vehicles‚Äî752 to be exact‚Äîare on the catalog to be obtained via different methods. Be it offered gratis, awarded for finishing weekly challenges, won in an auction, or earned through a wheelspin system as you progress further, it‚Äôs stellar indeed to have such a vast array of classic autos, retro machines, offroad monsters, and hypercars all at once.

But what made the series so special since its first debut? It is the vibrant world and excellent SimCade experience it offers. I‚Äôm neither a gearhead nor have driven anything but a Peugeot 206, though I can tell the feel when the rubber meets the road is done delicately. Whether using stock automobiles or finely-tuned ones, the racing remains peerless. The arcade handling ensures the game is accessible to new racers, while the heed to technicalities such as weight, speed, and torque gives it a personality beyond any recent racing titles.

It is also considered a haven for drift junkies. The art of carefully losing control of your car, as some might say. In addition to natural-born drifters, Hoonigan and Formula Drift should be your go-to cars for oversteering. However, with heavy tinkering, any machine can pull off the sideways action. It's a technical challenge that I've yet to master, but the very few times I managed to do so were glorious.

After the prologue, a wide range of activities pops out of every nook and cranny, though it isn‚Äôt only relegated to street racing. There are many instances of cross-country and rally competitions. Exploration is also presented in an engaging way: whizzing by speed cameras or pulling off slick stunts both yield hefty amounts of XP, while the game encourages wildlife and car photography as a hobby. Feel free to bring your friends along, challenge others to PVP, or take on the Drivatars. Speaking of which, much of my criticism stems from the fact that AI drivers turn without penalty in slippery conditions and often outpower you despite their lower-performance vehicles. At other times, the AI gives up entirely by crashing into the environment and never coming back.

Would it be surprising to say [b]Forza[/b] has a Battle Royale mode too? Not at all since those games have taken over the mantle. However, despite my simmering hatred of BRs, The Eliminator mode is rather enjoyable. Luck is not the primary decider, as you'll always have a chance to win even in low-tier vehicles. You have to ferociously race players head to head while securing better cars.

As for the cherry on top, the Horizon festival takes you through a tour of the four seasons, rotating on a weekly basis with new challenges each time. It‚Äôs not just the world turning into shades of amber and red as the autumn arrives or white when the snowfall hits; it takes on an entirely new identity. Your favorite gas guzzlers become a paperweight on icy roads unless correct parts like tires, to name one, are applied.

It‚Äôs all good fun until you decide to show off your mastery in online races. Reportedly, FH4 on Steam is inferior to the Microsoft Store version in terms of stability and connectivity. While I was burning rubber at a rock-solid 60 FPS, with settings cranked down to medium on a [I]Ryzen 5 3500X, GTX 1050 2GB, and 16 GB RAM[/i], many others were unfortunate to experience constant crashes or stutters. Anyway, no matter if I was racing in a free-for-all playlist or competing in ranked leagues, matchmaking issues and prolonged loading times due to players leaving mid-game left a bitter taste in my mouth. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn‚Äôt.

Virtual Great Britain may not be the most precise presentation of it seen to date but, oh my, isn‚Äôt it stunning nonetheless. The shifts in seasons ensure you see it all: dirt, ice, and tarmac. From ripping through sprawling flower fields in spring to the crunch of dry, dead leaves beneath your tires in fall, it makes a [i]jolly[/i] good spectacle, come rain or shine.

But what is greater than Britain? It‚Äôs the cars. They are rendered meticulously and are almost indistinguishable from their real-life models. The obsessive attention to detail, both interior and exterior, is too good of a photoshoot opportunity to pass.

[b][u]Audio[/u][/b]
The countryside is peaceful at all times, but the rumble of a turbocharged flat-four is the only noise that disturbs the tranquility of rural life. Pop, indie, R&B, rap, and other blasting tunes are all here to liven up the festival. Have a rather tender soul? Timeless FM has got you covered. Take that Jaguar E-Type out of the garage, listen to classics from Beethoven, Brahms, and Mozart while cruising through Edinburgh like you‚Äôre here only for the culture‚Äîor a cup of tea. Others say the soundscape lacks authenticity compared to its predecessor. It may do, but I have yet to play that.

[h3][b]The bottom line[/b][/h3]
[hr]Given the top-notch graphics and abundant activities, FH4 is an incredible SimCade with a satisfying loop of fun and rewards. It sets itself miles ahead of its competitors. It‚Äôs not the perfect racing experience, but then again it‚Äôs not trying to be. It‚Äôs a sophisticated, effortless luxury.[hr]

72,"Massively overpriced especially for existing owners. My biggest disappointment is that it still relies on UWP, it's just that it has an executable now.

EDIT: It's 70 EUR for the standard edition and 100 EUR for ultimate in Romania, which is absurd for a 2 year old game in any country, let alone one where the minimum wage is below 300 EUR.

Not worth it, I'll ask for a refund before I reach the 2 hour mark.

A few observations for the Steam version in particular:

+ They finally muted the obnoxiously loud intro.
- There's weird microstuttering when crossing the finish line in a race.
- Cursor occasionally vanishes.
- You CAN import liveries and tunes from the Xbox version if you upload them to the gallery first, but for whatever god forsaken reason you can't import them directly... like what?
- The Forza community team is just as ruthless on Steam as it is on Xbox, I got permanently banned from the Forza community hub for bypassing the world filter. They're allegedly censoring negative reviews as well, I say ""allegedly"" but it's definitely not out of character for them.
- You can use multiple Xbox accounts on one Steam copy, though I'm not sure to what extent this can be used to ban evade since I didn't have the time to try it.
- Save format is different than the Xbox version, maybe we'll be able to transfer saves in the future if anyone makes some kind of conversion tool but at the moment there is no easy way to save swap.
- Time travelling still works.
- Memory editing... kind of works? Didn't really have time to test it properly though.

I might push past the 2 hour limit to gather more information, since I can always just request a chargeback. But honestly even if it was a flawless port the price is pretty ridiculous.",0
73,"Easily one of the Best racing games out there, and if you have been waiting to pull the trigger on buying it, you absolutely should.

I've played a bunch of other racing games and none of them even come close to this, although this isn't a ""Racing Sim"" and is more of an arcade(y) game, it still is really good and has good attention to detail.

I personally waited this long to buy it because I didn't want to buy it on the Microsoft store, so when the game launched on steam I had no reason not to buy it so I did.

There is a variety of different cars to get in the game and although it's quite easy to obtain new cars (I already have 35 cars  with minimum effort put in to getting them) they are all really fun to just drive around in free roam.

While the game can benefit from better driving physics it's in no way bad at it's current stage and I am completely fine with that.

The game is straightforward and easy to understand even for complete beginners to the genre, it's easy to get lost in customizing your cars and sink a few hours into but that's what makes it fun (for me at least)

I have yet to come across anything (note worthy) that might make me dislike the game for now, however i would like it to not give new players so many free cars so early on in the game but that's just personal preference.

If you are unsure whether you want to buy the game or not, I highly recommend you buy and play it for an hour or so, if you do like it then good on you and you can keep playing, but if you don't like the game you can always refund it.

Anyways I've got to go deliver some tofu in my AE86.",1

76,"The UK is not exactly famous for its wonderful roads, but there are no two-hour traffic jams on the M25 or dispiriting stretches of the North Circular in Forza Horizon 4‚Äôs Britain. This is the Britain of romantic comedies, postcards and, one presumes, Brexiteers‚Äô imaginations. It is an idealised, compressed representation of our island comprising the Cotswolds, the Lake District, acres of beautiful woodland, the Highlands, Edinburgh, the east coast and the moors. There‚Äôs no urban sprawl, no rubbish suburbs and, perhaps most attractively of all, barely any people. In Forza Britain, instead of toiling in the gig economy to make your extortionate rent, you are gifted a house for helping out with some stunts on a movie shoot.

The game even turns our weather into something beautiful. As the seasons change, so does the climate and the nature of the light, along with the driving conditions. Edinburgh‚Äôs New Town shimmers in pale spring sunshine, and in winter the snow in the Highlands sucks all the light out of the sky. The cottages in Ambleside are prettiest in the summer, when the trees are so bracingly green you can almost smell them. If you have a 4K television, this is what it was made for. Now and then, such as the first time I drove past Edinburgh Castle in the perfect twilit blue of a summer night in Scotland, its beauty made me quite emotional.

The way all the cars feel are completely unique, and very close to reality. You can feel the weight of a Lamborghini, and you can feel the differences in shifting gears and precision between all cars. All of that is pure perfection. The graphics and sound is great too.",1

79,"Apparently playground games is so busy developing their newest game in the franchise that microsoft had to actually outsource the steam port of FH4 to someone completely not capable of doing such things: Sumo Nottingham

You'd think it's just a simple client swap, yet these people menaged to screw up the whole performance of the game.

While the windows store version has ZERO issues with performance or stability, the steam version is a crashing and stuttering mess. I've followed this version for a while, seen many patches deployed throughout the months since release yet clearly no progress has been made into improving that. Even buying this on sale feels like a scam.

If somehow this studio is involved in porting Forza Horizon 5 to steam, please respect your money and do not support disgusting work like this.

80,"Forza horizon 4 is simply breathtaking and the best racing game i have ever played.
The environment is beautiful and the graphics are amazing.
Loved the music tracks makes the game perfectly enjoyable.
I never realized i played this for almost 70 hours.
I absolutely loved this game.
I would recommend it but its expensive for many people and a lot of people have constant stutter and crash problems.
Luckily I didn't have that and the game worked like a charm on ultra @1080, 2k and 4k(50fps) except for few stutters before & after the race start cutscene or whatever it's called.
Can't wait for the 5th.

82,"I was in (what I consider) the golden era of growing up with PS1/PS2, and to talk about racing games specifically, boy was there an outstanding array of games. For PS1 we had (from memory) Driver, Destruction Derby, South Park Rally, Gran Turismo, Crash Team Racing. For PS2 we had (from memory) Burnout, Midnight Club, NFS Underground, NFS Most Wanted, NFS Carbon, FlatOut 2, Simpsons Road Rage! Iconic in their own creative ways. 

Those times were so good, that I've never really had a new racing game capture that level of engagement for 10+ years now. I also think that where I've become so accustomed to open-world games and the element itself, that I kind of expect that from games now, and so I am fairly selective through reviews and videos as to what I pick up. 

Forza Horizon 4 has combined my love for racing and my open-world preference, and provided the most fun I've had in a racing game for a long time, and in all fairness, if someone really pressed me to rank the above list in order of 'favourite' well, Forza Horizon 4 would be one of the elite. But I don't need to do that, I don't need to squeeze out a top ranking, I just need to tell you how damn good this game is.

Everything is crisp and the level of detail and consideration is precise. The map is huge, the challenges and accolades are endless, the unlocks are around every corner and at times the only question I have is ""what the hell should I do next?"" because it is just that - an infinite adventure. 

I am a newbie to the Forza franchise and I'm so glad I was able to get this. I managed to get this on a good sale, but I would comfortably pay full price for this. The gameplay is so good that it also made picking up the DLC (both at separate instances) a no-brainer. I don't often revisit games or venture forward into the DLC without careful consideration, however I was that ""Take my money!"" gif that we all know and love. Well played Forza.

To conclude - Forza Horizon 4 is so good, it made me buy the ultimate edition of Forza Horizon 5.

84,"The game itself is great, and possibly worth it if you haven't played it before. The full retail price for a 3 year old game is a bit surprising, especially since I'd expect a new game is probably soon [i]on the horizon[/i]. Also the EUR pricing is beyond f***ed, I'd wait for them to address it or for a sale.

Existing players from Game Pass, not worth it at all. The lack of cross save is definitely no technical limitation, they are likely just hoping it will make you buy DLCs. Don't kid yourself to think much work had to take place to migrate the game from Xbox store to Steam, and that somehow prevented a common save format. At the very least they could've provided a path to migrate it over to Steam.",0

89,"Let me start by saying that Forza is not a terrible game by any means and it's not ""broken"" or anything close to that.
That being said, I think this game doesn't get enough criticism and it might mislead some people about it. It's the kind of game that might charm you at first but the more you play it, the more the tons of minor annoyances start to pile up and ruin the experience.

[b] I'll start with the good things : [/b]
-It looks good and it runs well. Performance and visuals are rarely and issue and as long as you have an alright machine you are probably not gonna have any problem trying to run it at 60 fps or above. 
-Car selection is unmatched. You won't ever find a game with this amount of cars in any other place.
-Plenty of content and a decent open world to drive in.
-It's pretty decent for arcade racers and for people looking for a slightly more realistic driving experience.

So as a racing game in general, you know, it's pretty fine. It checks the boxes of driving decently, looking good and having plenty to do.

[b]Now, my issues with it...[/b]

-Bland. This is subjective, I know, but it can get quite irritating. This blandness is all over the game. The dialogues, characters, stories, visuals, music... everything is as non-offensive and PG-friendly as possible to a fault. I don't expect it to be super edgy or something but, it just lacks any real personality at all.

-I hope you like listening to the same 4-5 songs in each loading screen because that's all you will have for the rest of your experience. And don't worry, you can't mute them either because music can't be fully turned off.

-Despite what you may have seen or read here, playing with a steering wheel sucks. I have the very common Logitech G29 and the Force Feedback is basically non existent and feels really odd. You are just putting yourself in a disadvantage if you actually wanna play with a wheel. It's extremely jarring coming from Assetto Corsa (A sim, I know, but still). Maybe fine for casual use but if you have tried more serious racing games, wheel implementation is bad. The game is definitely optimized for controllers first, then keyboard, and steering wheel last.

-There is more loading than you would expect. For example, The Crew despite being a worse game, lets you fast travel teleport and go around the world seamlessly. Here basically everything has a loading screen, a short one, but there is one. Considering how ""optimized"" and modern this game is, it's a rather disappointing aspect of it and affects the flow of the game.

-[b]Online is absolute garbage[/b]. Trying to make a convoy with friends? Fine, that probably works...sometimes. Now don't even try to join a race together because the process tends to be convoluted and end up with someone disconnected. Now, if you actually manage to join a race or event pray that the rest of the people actually connect to it. If you are lucky enough you will be able to play some. Otherwise, you are probably gonna get stuck at some loading screen for literal 10 minutes while the game tries to find or synchronize players.
It's just, awful. Absolutely pathetic that a game this modern can't figure out a proper online system that doesn't suck like this. It's barely functional sometimes and it really blows my mind how you can be waiting for 10 or more minutes trying to do something without even the option to cancel the loading so you have to straight up close the game.

-Sound. Already addressed some in FH5 but, the sound in this game can go from quite alright to straight up bad, really bad. From inaccurate sounds, to very artificial ones. There are some quite decent ones mind you but it's very subpar compared to other racing titles. Basically any NFS game that you have played will have more exciting car sounds than this and that is quite sad.

-The hand holding. If you wanna ""progress"" through the story of the game be prepared to be interrupted all the time with dialogues and more dialogues telling you what to do next and where to go.

-The intro section is so long too, it takes a couple of hours before you can actually get into the real game, and you have to go every season before getting into the real festival, and proper multiplayer. I understand kinda why they did it like that but the game isn't that complex and having to jump through so many hoops to actually get into the real thing is just annoying.

-Lack of progression, despite being part of the core philosophy of the game is a bit boring. Since you are able to basically do whatever you want with whatever car you want in the game, getting new cars doesn't really feel rewarding and finishing events through the game just doesn't feel too special. Some people might prefer this sandbox style but I admit I prefer a more old-school kind of progression through the game.

-Wheelspins. Be ready to waste time and expectations collecting emotes, horn sounds, awful clothes and absolutely useless 2.000 credits prizes. Surely you can get some good things from them from time to time, but you get so many wheelspins all the time, that you are just bound to get garbage constantly.

-Ads. I can't believe a game of this price actually has unskipable ads in it. They only happen a couple of times but they are there, just to remind you that you should have spend even more money on an already expensive game. And don't forget that either, if you want some of the ""meta"" cars you are gonna have to get the Car Pass and/or some DLCs. Bad.

-Quick chat is a neat feature that's again, ruined by only being able to equip 4 at the same time which basically means that it's impossible to communicate properly with other people in the world. This game just doesn't feel made to be ""social"", ironically.

-Special mention to the extremely convoluted menus and UI that to this day I still haven't fully figured out. It has so many options, menus, events and things that you can access that I feel like 90% of the people that play this won't ever figure out what you can actually do in the game.

Those are basically my thoughts. It's a good sandbox, with lots of cars, kinda fun to race and lots of different activities to partake in, but with an absolutely terrible online system, horrible dialogue and music, with a very boring and kid friendly atmosphere, and with so many little problems that despite being a pretty looking game your experience will only get worse with time. I can mostly recommend it for the single player experience. You might not care about the things I mentioned so if that's the case, go ahead and buy since there aren't many racing games like this anyway.

90,"Before bashing me on how I've only experienced all of this in one hour, I've family shared it with my main account here :
https://steamcommunity.com/id/parsadotgh/

I've sadly never experienced T10's pervious titles such as Motorsport 4 or Horizon 1 so I cannot really compare it to them; but I will try to briefly describe my experience with this game so far.
let's just get to the pros and cons since I'm more comfortable writing reviews like this.

Pros :
+Good car variety : It isn't just about some over the top hypercars. You have the choice to just drive around with daily drivers, antiques, retros and classics, SUVs, offroads, hell even Peel P50.

+Nice looking game : It's a rather nice looking game especially if you're in Fortune Island. You could take some good photos with the photomode of the game as well!

+Good AI : As long as you don't play Unbeatable on short tracks, the AI gives some good challange and the difficulty tab has a wide range for it. It's clearly not the best of the best but it is servicable.

+Good netcode : Well, I haven't spent that much time on Online but for the poor internet I have, so far I had no big issues with it.

+4 season concept is very nicely implemented : And as much as alot of people are going to disagree with me, I absolutely loved the winter season. I know it sucks to drive in that condition, but I still liked it alot.

+Generally a nice driving experience : The core gameplay on its own is definitely something to admire. While it may look like a usual arcade racer (which it kinda is), underneath it lays the many mechanics from Motorsport series such as wheel temperature. Now no need to worry, it isn't anything over the top or complex. 

Cons :
-Mediocre soundtrack : Although I haven't played the previous games (I did played FH3 a little), but I sometimes just put up a playlist of previous games than this game. The worst thing is you cannot completely mute them and the only workaround is renaming/deleting the pak file. Not even Hospital Records was any good but hey, this is personal preference. Maybe my taste just sucks.

-Bland map : Or maybe it's just Britain that looks like this? I don't know but what I'm trying to say is that even Lego expansion map looks more interesting and diverse than this. Hell, go look at FH3 and FH5 map.

-unbearable and cringy characters : I don't know what these video game companies take their customers for. Some weird absurd fellow who would unironically call themselves ""gamer"" and uses video game phrases like ""GG WP GL HF"" on real life or something? Here I thought The Crew 2 was bad enough. Hell, I don't even remember that lady's name altough I'm almost regularly play the game. I don't know maybe I'm just growing out of this phase and all of these mostly appeals early teeagers.

-Old models for some cars : Look, resuing assets? it is completely fine, it's even very beneficial. But sometimes the line gets crossed when you see they still use 7th gen models on some cars; Most infamously, the 512 TR, ISF and S15.

-Laughable engine notes : I am no gearhead and I don't reclaim my sources from some random Youtube video of a guy revving the same car from the game, but this here is just as bad as Gran Turismo 6. Even casual players with no prior knowledge on automotives can easily notice these. I mean go and listen to Viper ACR

-Not rewarding, at all in fact : I don't expect some tiring grindfest, but come on, 2 hours I'm in the game and I'm already sitting on top of 4 hypercars from superwheelspins. I wish there was a way to have something you could value. Test Drive Unlimited 2 was a nice example.


Conclusion : after all these flaws I've mentioned, I still recommend this game because you need to take this more as a sandbox-ish racing game and there's a certain rule for this game to be enjoyed to fullest :
only play when your brain is completely off. like coming back home from work, walk, exercise etc. and don't sit down and play the game all day otherwise you'll burn yourself out too soon. My advice? play for plenty of hours only, and don't care much about the playlists and its rewards. Just play to enjoy not to torture yourself over perfecting on something.

also I haven't said much about multiplayer since I generally don't play racing games online knowing well people will only suck meta's c*ck and drive like a subhuman. be it this game, nfs or Gran Turismo.",1
91,"Awesome game.

This is what I would imagine an ideal open world street racer to be like lots of fun. I enjoy being able to just cruise around and drive where ever I want, the game feels kinda like a sequel to Midnight club and Test Drive Unlimited the location is set in Edinburgh Scotland which is nice and great to explore, the map is huge and the car selection is massive, there is so many different types of cars to choose from its crazy.

The game play is quality, the cars handle nicely and the difficulty can be adjusted, The single player experience is excellent I never really run out of things to do, I enjoy being able to play multiplayer mode with my friends, it can be really fun with the various different modes, capture the flag and Infected are really good. I like all the different race events, searching for collectables is fun, doing side missions against the clock or stunt challenges etc can be cool and rewarding. Some times I find the race tracks can be a bit recycled or unorganised but to be honest its not really something that bothers me that much, I do think it would have been great if they added cops to the game kinda sucks that there isnt any.

Something I should mention is that I had two problems with the game. 

The first issue I had was stuttering, to be fair it was mostly during cut scenes, I did notice it during game play and between transitions like when ever I finished a race event or when I was about to start one however I was able to fix this issue. It was kinda my own fault for not keeping my graphics card drivers up to date, as soon as I opened a tool on my computer called ""Geforce Experience"" I updated my video card drivers and this prity much fixed the issue for me. The game only stutters a little bit now before starting events but a part from that the game is smooth and runs great.

The second problem was a crashing issue, basically the game would randomly close and go straight to desktop for no reason. This took me a while to actually get fixed it really gave me a headache trying to solve it. There was a lot of things mentioned by different sources such as: updating Windows to the latest version available, disabling my firewall and running the game as Admin then moving the game from my Hard drive to my Solid State drive etc. None of these worked. In the end one of my friends was able to figure out what the issue was and fix it for me. I had to change the Windows Sound depth on my computer to ""24 Bit 44100 Hz"" the settings I was using was 48000 Hz after I did this the game was no longer crashing and I was able to play it at max settings just fine with no more issues.

Another thing that bugs me about the game is every time I load the game up it always brings up the Steam overlay then displays a web page asking me to link my Steam account with my Windows account which is not something I feel comfortable doing and there is no option to select NO so I always have to click the X icon to close the web page down some times it can be annoying it would be nice if the game stopped asking me. 

I was rather gutted when I ran into these problems but I am glad I was finally able to get the game working properly. Right now I think its one of the best racing games currently available. I would still totally recommend it just beware you may encounter some issues and have to fix them before you can play the game.

Overall a fantastic game.",1

93,"[h1]Best Open World Racing Game I've played [/h1]
I usually don't play racing games but this is hands down of the best racing game I've played in past 2 decades and first open-world racing game that was easy to understand. It is visually beautiful and wonderfully functional at the same time. I'm enjoying it even with just 4 hrs in. I'd advise you to lower the difficultly level just one notch below average if you are new to racing games for starters and are finding winning difficult. The map is very easy to use in this game as compared to games I've encountered before this. The race route gets marked on screen-HUD thus making it easier to navigate. The terrain is beautiful and controls can be customised. The cars can be tuned and many people have made presets which can be purchased for credits. All in all if you are new to the racing genre and have a decent PC-Laptop you should buy this game's ultimate version for the best racing experience one can have.",1

99,"The game itself is great. Has nice graphics, huge amount of car choices. But every single time the developers update the game, they manage to screw something up. Plus, the wheel support for this game is not that good and if you have an older/entry level wheel, you'll definitely have problems with it.

My first major headache with this game was when they updated it and it simply wouldn't start... They did not issued a fix neither assisted the players in the discussion topics. The devs simply pin a few possible solutions and don't care about the rest. So it's up to you to fix the game you paid for.

Secondly, i just found out that this month's update is having issues with steering wheels (And many other players are experiencing the same as me). Notice that this is the update after the one the game wouldn't start. (So, two updates in a row broke the gameplay.)

Everytime you get something new in this game, you'll also get a hard time to fix what the devs broke..

So, steer clear from this game if you don't want to have headaches fixing this every time an update comes out... Because i'm gonna be honest here, half of the time that i spent playing FH4, i was having either issues with my steering wheel freezing in-game, my game not starting or some other dumb issue that could have been avoided if someone payed attention to what they're doing over at PGG.

103,"Forza Horizon 4 (FH4) is an open-world arcade racing game. Initially you are given a few cars and must complete a number of events to progress to the next season. Completing the latter grants you credits to buy more cars and opens up new events, such as street races, off-road trails, online team events, speed traps, jump stunts and even a battle-royal mode with The Governator as a rare announcer. Players may unlock more than 700 cars and may also tune and paint each of them. So you may apply your favorite ""Hello Kitty"" or ""SpongeBob"" design on your Hypercar or Truck. FH4 offers so much content in fact that after spending nearly 150 hours, I still have not yet seen everything.

FH4 was ported by Sumo Digital to Steam and the launch was not without problems: After launch I ran sometimes into connectivity issues/long loading times in multi-player and experienced a few crashes. Today, the game runs very smooth for me as patches seem to have solved these issues. I highly recommend FH4 to everyone who enjoys racing games.",1

A workaround is to force the game to run either on the CPU's integrated graphics chip, or hope your system has a CPU-processed HDMI output and set Windows to utilize the dedicated card's physics rendering to maintain high performance. Still attempting to break down why this is happening.
-----------
After about a week of troubleshooting, working with both the developers and the Steam Community discussion threads, there is currently no known working fix for my issue and there are seemingly thousands of other players with these issues.

Mine relates specifically to a memory leak, where on startup the game will use an unlimited amount of ram (tested on a system with 256GB of RAM, and then another system with 32GB of RAM but a 1024 GB page file) and the game utilized 100% memory on both.

There are currently no known fixes, and users have reported issues like this since Day 1 of the Steam Launch and there have been zero fixes or updates released to resolve these problems, including the reports of stuttering even on high end systems.

There is no point in purchasing this game until the developers recognize these issues and focus their efforts on fixing them rather than releasing new content that their users cannot use. As of this post I've requested a refund on my purchase, but may consider buying again in the future if devs acknowledge and fix the real issues users are having.",0

125,"ANALYSIS: Forza Horizon 4

Well, if there's one thing you can't complain about about the Forza Horizon series, it's the variety of things you can do. In the fourth game of the series, you can evolve your reputation in the eyes of the festival public in any way you want. One option is to become a master of dirt track racing with iconic rally cars like the Ford RS2000, Subaru Imprenza WRX STI or even an Escort. Ideal street races for hot hatches like the Ford Focus RS or for supersports like McLaren Senna also make their presence. And the game doesn't even force you to use the right car for every situation. If you want to rally with a Volkswagen Beetle against cars of the same speed, feel free. The rule here is fun.

And maybe that's why Horizon games fit so well into the gaming market we have today. The Playground Games team uses the same engine as the Forza Motorsport games, which brings gameplay in a style called ""simcade"" - more serious than the arcade of Need for Speed, but without the total dedication to the simulation of RFactor 2 or Assetto Corsa . This style fits perfectly into Horizon's proposal and occupies an empty space that was left by Test Drive Unlimited and even Burnout: that of taking your car and using an extensive map as your amusement park.

In Forza Horizon 4 you are free to do whatever you want whenever you want. But if you want a more guided experience, there are 40 missions of what feels like a story mode. I say this because this is not a campaign that stands out from the rest of the game, but rather trivial activities that have the same importance as all the others. The difference is that there's a little more context here: in the first 10 stages, for example, you're a stunt driver for action movies and commercials. From a gameplay perspective, this provided some of my favorite moments in the game.

That's because these missions choose exactly which cars you will use. The Forza Motorsport series tends to bring nearly a thousand different cars ‚Äì Horizon 4 takes advantage of around 450 of these ‚Äì but they are not necessarily made with the same quality and care. So, the cool thing about missions is being able to drive some of the most detailed and best-represented vehicles in the game. These activities also bring a variety that is very welcome when providing missions like parking a Mini Cooper on top of a container or jumping out of a mill with a Bugatti Chiron.

As it should be for a 2018 game, you'll do all this to gain more relevance as an ""influencer"" with the festival's audience. Once you get the necessary points, the organization invites you to an exhibition (or showcase) against some super alternative vehicle. Suffice it to say that the first time you face a giant hovercraft known as a ""hovertransfer"". One of my biggest frustrations with the game is that I can't even drive it. There's even a showcase inspired by the Halo series and narrated by Cortana.

The biggest criticism is the lack of gameplay modifications, which hasn't changed much from Forza Horizon 3 ‚Äì and actually only received tweaks since Forza Motorsport 5 in 2013. Okay, the series has a lot of options and alternative assistance and difficulties for the most casual driver to the most hardcore who want to use a steering wheel. But these options could go further, to casual players who want the Burnout experience or bringing a more complete simulation for those coming from a Project Cars life.

Forza Horizon 4 is quick to show you what you're here for and what you have to offer. A few moments after opening the game, you are already placed directly on your first run ‚Äì or on your first runs, for that matter. The player is introduced to the game's concept of seasons, experiencing firsthand how the title operates in autumn, winter, spring and summer. The snippet was shown in a demo during E3 2018, so it's already known to some players, but it's impressive for the gameplay variability.

Conclusion

Forza Horizon 4 is a beautiful racing game already produced, with gameplay that maintains the arcade footprint mixing some simulation elements, the title manages to entertain for hours and hours with varied tests under the most diverse weather conditions, all within a scenario charming. A must for speed lovers. Here I leave my recommendation for the game, and your analysis.",1

127,"If you like arcade styled racing I would pick this up before they delist it. Which should be in the next year or so. Even with the 5th installment of the franchise available on steam, you may want this one in your collection for a few reasons. 

It has a great snow season for those who actually want snow on the streets. I know some hate when this is ""forced"" on you, but ultimately you can optionally enjoy this feature in FH4, while its not even an option in FH5 due to the huge differences in the environments. If you want snow, get FH4 for the occasional snow romp. (You have snow in the high altitudes in FH5, but its mostly dirt, hill climb type conditions. I love rally, but I love my street too, if not more these days.)

It also has a proper nighttime that is dark and impacts your visibility. FH5 has a very blue night that isn't as intimidating, and I can see why people may prefer that. But having the OPTION to drive in these conditions is desirable to me, so FH4 will stay in the rotation for times like this.

FH4 also runs supremely for me without any odd visual rendering issues. I can run it on extreme settings in 4k and it looks nice without performance issues. It doesn't have popin/drawin very close, or odd texture updates as I drive at 300mph. At this time that can not be said for the 5th installment of the franchise.

I suggest you pick this up for your collection before you can't. Because even though I believe the 5th version will improve, it can't replace some of the experiences you get here. It doesn't have to be your main, but you may appreciate it as a side gig from time to time.

Also, surprisingly, FH4 online casual free roam MP is more lively right now than FH5 due to many issues with the newest release. I enjoy driving random cars and meeting random people online, and FH4 still has some life left in this area. Some sessions have dozens of cars on the highway, it is great!",1
128,"Originally posted on the Halo MCC Collection reviews. Reposting on other games affected by this issue.

Game is dependent on a Microsoft account, did not think that was a problem in the past.

Unable to play this game now as I have not been able to use my Microsoft account for two and a half months (Start of May).

Started off with my account having issues logging in.
Turns out it was hijacked, so the account was locked and I have since ended up going through endless hoops of support, who all say they can't do anything directly and to submit a form to unlock the account.
I have submitted four forms over the last two and a half months with no emails or information back.

Requests for information get bounced around from place to place. Most saying they do not have the ability or cannot due to privacy concerns. More like they don't want any accountability.
Once asked for a supervisor, waited two hours on the phone. He said he would call me back at a specific day at a specific time, he never did.
Poor support staff are usually as helpful as they can be which is not much. Anyone with any access does not interact with end users and information does not dribble through at all.
If the unlock form id's are anything to base this on, then over the last two and a half months they have had 600,000+ additional new requests for account unlocks, wonder how many of them also had their accounts hijacked and are not having much luck.

One support ticket I supplied a whole bunch of information for my gmail account. Ended up receiving an email a month later saying the investigation would be cancelled unless I supplied more information so I supplied as much as I could, order numbers and everything. Never got another reply or response from that line again.

If you lose your account due to whatever vulnerability they have then good luck trying to get access again. I had two factor authentication and I don't reuse passwords for accounts.
This is not my only game on steam tied to a Microsoft account, I have lost many hundreds of pounds worth of games thanks to this mess. I have zero trust in this company from now on.

-- Update --
So here is an update on the above.

Request for account reinstatement denied on the latest (glad they actually bothered to email this time).

I supplied order numbers, dates, times, transaction Id's, the works. Fucking denied.

So any games and shit that get bought that's it, all literally unusable.

You get an email back saying you did not supply enough details and that all further messages will be ignored and that they know its  ""frustrating"".

Two factor on microsoft accounts has vulnerabilities and can be worked around so your account can be stolen without you even knowing about it.

After that, the support guys will ignore your ticket for ages, until you keep doing them, then finally give you the fuck you.

Never buying another microsoft related game again, seeking refunds (though I highly doubt I would get any of my money back).",0

‚ûï music on radio wasnt known for me but any radio wave sounds cool and u can find a good wave for ur mood anyways üé∂üé∂üé∂ 

‚ûï online events and sessions. The world is full of players which brings more life and interaction to the gaming process üåêüåêüåê

‚ûï various multiplayer modes. It features many things to compete in. U can choose between solo, team or even battle royal (without guns... only cars... but it works great!). Didnt see any cheaters or imbalanced guys who always beat u. Seems that everyone can win üèÜüèÜüèÜ

‚ûï small but cool feature for single player only. U can rewind and correct ur mistakes. Missed a turn? Too much speed? Chose a wrong direction? No problems just rewind and make it the right way. This feature helps a lot if u are noob like me. And helps to gain some experience or analyze situation to learn how to actually play üïõüïõüïõ

‚ûï A whole bunch of activities. U just cant choose something one! U were driving to a race marker on the map... but then BOOM and u r doing collectibles then u see some cool jumps then speed or drift zone and finally u realize that dont even reached that race mark üòÖ Big enough world and 2 dlc worlds. U wont get bored I promise üí•üí•üí•

‚ûï both 1st person and 3rd person views are great. Its equally enjoyable to play from any point. And unlike in gta 5 u wont have an idea to kill urself when playing from 1st person üôÄüôÄüôÄ

‚ûï best dlc I've ever seen is LEGO. Breaking this plastic bricks is absolutely enjoyable. And beautiful. U should try this feeling which takes u back to ur childhood üèóüèóüèó

‚ûï deep car customization. I think guys who know something about cars and like to set some things like air pressure in wheels gonna find this process very interesting üîßüîßüîß

‚ûï drift... no seriously... drift in this game is an art. Never understood this thing in real life. But forza forces u too love drift and and makes u trying to understand how to use mechanical gears. Btw didnt know that drift came from Japan. Forza told me) üáØüáµüáØüáµüáØüáµ

‚ûï flexible difficulty system. U can customize how hard or easy game should be in many ways. So it suits for any drivers and skills üë©‚Äçüéìüë¥üë®‚Äç‚öïÔ∏èüë∂üëßüò∫ü§ñüëΩ

Cons:

‚ûñ game freezes or crashes randomly if steam overlay is enabled. Hope they'll fix it. But for now just make sure uve disabled steam overlay to forget about random lags üò∞üò∞üò∞

‚ûñ no adaptive triggers support (unlike in windows store version). Some guys said that this feature means too much for them. I've tried it in controller app. Seems cool but not necessary for me. I think usual vibration is ok. Anyways u can enable these option with the custom mod from a random guy from github if u really need it üëæüëæüëæ

‚ûñ no really good looking crashcams and real car crash physics. Destroying small things like fences, wooden goods, lego bricks or flowers fields is enjoable but when it comes to bumping in a train it's time to cry... After playing burnout I wanted to see good crash cams from action movie. But there r no good crashes. I wanted at least an option to enable or disable this üëéüò≠üî´üé•üóë

‚ûñ no option to skip some dumb boring speeches üò¥üò¥üò¥

‚ûñ no option to edit character's appearance. while available presets far not beautiful ü§®ü§®ü§®

‚ûñ when you beep the character does nothing üì£üì£üì£

P.S. anyways here we have the best racing game of all time for now

1 billion nfs/the crew/grand turismo/project cars of 1 good racing game",1
130,"To be honest, if I could I would play this game every day. I mean the graphics are amazing unlike any other, and the cars themselves are outstanding I mean so many to choose from, even now they are still adding more and more but of course there's so many yet never enough XD

I grew up playing racing sames(gtr, NFS, and dirt rally, and some recent ones project cars and Assetto Corsa) I started playing Forza Motorsport since the 3rd installment. I enjoyed how Forza improved the graphics gameplay and ofc OG soundtrack of the game <3 it would have been great if they had added the option to add a personal soundtrack :) 

In my opinion, Horizon 4 is the best racing game out there !!!! can't FUCKING wait for FORZA HORIZON 5",1
131,get the microsoft version if your switching from xbox because steam wont let you sync your data :),1
132,"The game has a lot of enjoyable offline content but if you want to buy the game for team racing and online adventures then I'd recommend you go look somewhere else. Online racing is almost non-playable as of now due to the servers not loading and a terrible net-synchronization. And the game won't be updated anymore so this problem will most likely never be fixed.

UPDATE: Online Servers have shut down due to Forza 5, DO NOT BUY THIS GAME AT FULL PRICE. IS NOT WORTH YOUR MONEY. I'd say 80% discount is the BARE MINIMUM you should accept.",0
133,why need a therapist when you can buy this game + g29,1
134,"[h1]I dedicated this review to the game that we love so much - Forza Horizon 4.[/h1] 
 
[b]
[i]I will not describe the positive aspects, because I don‚Äôt see the point in this, other authors have described them more than once. I will talk about the cons of this game, they are the ones that annoy me the most and completely destroy the positive impression of the game! 
¬´I'm not a veteran of the series, FH4 ‚Äî is my first game, so I'm unfamiliar with previous games in the series¬ª.[/i] 
 [/b]

[b]1. Racing against real people.[/b] 
[i]Why play with bots, if you want ¬´Hardcore¬ª, drive against real people. And this is the first thing I did, after getting used to the game a little. 
The game has several modes that can give you, according to the developer, ¬´a feeling of competition:¬ª[/i] 
 
- Network adventure (team races, races every man for himself) 
 
[i]I will touch on these two modes, since the rest are still far from the concept of ¬´Race¬ª in its classical sense. The online adventures listed above are classic Horizon modes, but instead of bots, they involve real people. And it would seem that ¬´this is it¬ª, what is needed, but here nuances emerge. 
[list]
[*][b]You are pushed into a tree by your opponent or teammate;[/b]
[*][b]You have decided to win in your favorite car, but the meta-car in your class has moved so far away from you that there is no chance to win;[/b]
[*][b]Asphalt sprint series without checkpoints where it is more profitable to go to the cut (right to the finish line) like on a tank;[/b]
[/list]
And this is only a small part of what I met in about ten - fifteen hours in this mode. Do you think the ranked mode changes something? Whatever it is, the situation is only getting worse. And all this has no solution, there are no penalties during the race, nor after it, in fact, such behavior is even encouraged, because the ultimate goal is to win. Only when you lost, because the opponent just drove into your car and you flew into a tree, you feel only resentment, there are no positive emotions in this.[/i]

[b]2. Meta car.[/b] 
[i]This moment is really strange for me, don't get me wrong, I understand perfectly well that different cars have different advantages and disadvantages, and the task of tuning is to improve the car, but even within the framework of the game it goes beyond reason. Here's a banal question for you - what do you think, which car in the B700 class will go the fastest in rally racing? Probably the first to come to mind are Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution VI or Subaru Legacy RS, it wasn‚Äôt there! Hold on the legends of the world rally! Here he is the leader of the class: Manx Mayers 1971 
This little buggy, when properly tuned, will produce 130hp/260 torque at a weight of 480kg, which turns it into a small monster that will accelerate to 100km/h in under 5 seconds, handle perfectly at any speed on any surface and brake like a modern Volvo. And while he has no flaws, just no. Well, how do you like it on the Evo VI or Legacy RS? It‚Äôs good if you get into the top 500. 
There are about 2-3 dozen meta-cars in the game and you won‚Äôt be able to beat them, no matter how hard you try. 
 
I understand that in general the gameplay is difficult to balance and obviously there are cars that are the best of the best, but it's still cars like 599XX EVO, Manx, Toyota Baja Truck Welcome Pack, only spoil the feeling of the game, they destroy a sense of the reality of what is happening in which you understand that a stock car cannot go 500+ km / h, a small buggy with a huge engine will not have good handling due to imbalance, and a sports truck(Baja Truck) that is tuned in rubbish improves even more, so that you can't keep up with him, even if you're driving a sports car. I understand that the game is made in the arcade genre, but isn't it too arcade?[/i] 
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2799197660
[b]3. Network. 
[i]Constant problems connecting to the Internet! 
Crashes, micro-freezes, unplayable online modes. 
ten minutes you participate in races. And the remaining thirty - forty minutes you wait until these same races are loaded. And of course the most terrible transfer to Steam. In the Microsoft Store, such problems did not seem to be observed.[/i] 
[/b] 
 
[b]4. To summarize:[/b] 
[i]For me, the game was neither good nor bad. The game has many positive aspects that I have not touched on here, and I want the shortcomings described above to be corrected in the future. Then perhaps this game would have even more fans. This is a game that wants to be for everyone, but it has not yet turned out.[/i]",0
135,The best racing game,1
136,need a rest after riding Torrent all day.,1
137,"No way to transfer saves from Windows version of the game to Steam, which made me request for refund.",0
138,"This is my favorite racing game next to Burnout Paradise. The reason is simple - this will give you an experience that no other racing game can give. This is simply brilliant, the cars, the graphics, the gameplay, the hard body physics, the open world. 

This game has everything and you can notice that the devs put their heart into it. I am a casual gamer and I love to free roam in this game. Though once I was a hardcore racing game fan and it also has that. As being this kind of game its not just some simple racing till death game. It has different kinds of aspect and events all out the huge open world map it provided. You can race on track, on dirt, on snow, even on Lego world. 

Yeah thats right it even has its expansion, the Lego world, where you can race in Lego cars and smash through Lego trees, fields even objects that can only be found in Lego World lol. I mean this is awesome, I love this game.

This game has like countless cars that you can collect or even buy from auction. The events are almost endless and with time and seasons the events change so you will not get bored if you have time. If you don't want to do that then that is fine also just free roam with your desired car and enjoy the beauty of nature, the feel of driving fast cars and trying out all kinds of cars. This game makes all those possible, even if you cant own the cars in real life. Yeah I know thats the sad part but look you ain't dying from the crashes that you are doing in that game lol.

So if you want the feel of this game, I think its available on game pass so you can try that out or just buy this game. I would say this game deserves the full price but it goes on sale quite often so feel free to grab it whenever you like. But yeah be sure to grab the Ultimate Edition as that gives you everything except 1 dlc which is the Hot Wheels Legends Car Pack which you can buy later. But to enjoy this game to fullest get the Ultimate Edition, but you can also enjoy it with Standard Edition but without the expansions so the choice is yours. Hopefully I will get the Forza Horizon 5 too but probably on sale and after I finish this games main events and had enough fun from it.",1
139,"I always loved racing games since I was young, even though I still know nothing about cars today. To me, it's all about skills & good reaction time & this game can give people that! It's been a while since I've been excited for a big open-world racing gaming like Forza.

I was so looking forward to driving around a beautiful area like Great Britain while meeting other players. Driving around with my friends in convoy (party), & discovering new game activities like small businesses for a delivery service or being a stunt driver for a movie, a taxi driver for different clients, or just jumping off a ramp while going 265 MPH (430 KM/H).

This game keeps on giving, which blew my mind the first month I played the Microsoft Store version of the game. As a completionist, every race, every objective I try to beat, new ones are appearing on the map like there is no end to it! There can be so many icons on the map that I have to use the filter to see where everything I need is. But if you're like me, you're going to be satisfied with this one because not every vehicle can be purchased at the auto show (shop). They have to be earned by racing or by doing events.

Some cars can only be earned by reaching certain levels in different driving series like road racing, cross-country, dirt, drag racing, street racing (races include traffic), drift, speed traps, danger zones for crazy jumps, speed zones, & trailblazer (LEGO stuff). Others cars can be earned by just driving around the map & destroying private properties or kicking dirt with drift & burnouts in someone's yard & windows, or simply by driving recklessly & pulling dangerous near misses & stunts to increase various parts of the ""Horizon Life"" experience & reputation.

The progression is measured by an influence system & a level system. The more influence people earn, the higher their level is with a max level of 2999 or 10 ‚òÖ (prestige). Each action the player does in the game will be rewarding, including ramming into your neighbor's fences! I don't recommend doing that in real life, however. No matter how much you hate your neighbor. Influence can be earned with the following steps I mentioned above and by showing off your taste & even your artistic skills. Taking enough pictures of cars or the beautiful scenery will give the player more influence. But the same goes for creating some 3000-layer-stunningly good-looking paint jobs for a car of the player's choice to help them earn money & influence. 

On top of that, if you are a mechanic expert, then by customizing & tuning vehicles, it's possible to become famous & rich among other players by sharing the best tuning setups to make a car drive better. The same goes for creating paint jobs or just small stickers for everyone to use. So, in case you have none of those skills in you, you can always search for various stickers to put together & create your dream car and download someone's tunes to help you progress through a race you hate so much because the only car you own for a specific class requirement happens to feel like a boat.

And speaking of skills! If you're the kind of person who sucks at every racing game, you're just terrified of touching a simulator game because they're often too hard for you, well you shouldn't be scared. After all, you can always adjust the game difficulty along with the AI difficulty & turn them into brainless drivers. If that's not enough for you, there's even an option for assisted steering & brakes, which will pretty much turn the car for you & slow down before every turn. Although I don't know anyone who would use that, but hey! It's optional!

Now back to creativity & AI for a moment. Those who are creative or even cheap & non-competitive can abuse this creation system by creating their race & drive around the map, drawing the race lines they want & the AI will follow. Other players, too, if they don't realize what you've been up to by creating a race track while drunk, ramming into every tree, trash cans & street lights. I'm telling you, the AI will follow! The traffic won't go away while creating them, by the way, so you can also tell whenever someone just crashed into a car while creating the race just because the line will suddenly have a Z in it.

As mentioned earlier, there's a lot to be done in this game. There's a form of story mode related to Horizon Festival, but more is to be done even after completing those. So, a Festival playlist consists of completing multiple race events to increase the progression gauge up to 50% for an access pass to new events & up to 80% for a rare vehicle. That's the main ""story."" Then there's also a seasonal event that lasts about one week with another completion rate of 50% & 80% for legendary vehicles, which can also be purchased from other players at the auction house for those who hate grinding or for less-skilled players. The seasonal events are slightly more challenging for those who are into that.

Almost everything can be played with friends & strangers, either in co-op or against each other. I like a few PVP online modes, but my favorite is survival mode, which consists of avoiding ""zombie"" cars & lasts as long as possible. Chase or be chased!

Those who want to own everything in the game will have to work for it. Certain vehicles, horns, character accessories, clothes &... stupid dance moves can only be acquired by purchasing them with Forza Points (FP) from the Forzathon Shop. To earn points, the player must participate in a live group event that occurs randomly on the map. Everyone must participate to earn those points. But not to worry! There's nothing competitive about that event. It's similar to Burnout Paradise's online challenges if you ever played that game. As for the character appearance, the player will be greeted with a character customization menu at the beginning of the game with 14 character presets to choose from. The player can change their character at any time. As for clothes, outfits & accessories, a lot of them will be locked behind a completion system. But it can be unlocked with wheel spins & super wheelspins, which is some form of loot boxes that can be earned pretty quickly by just leveling up (Similar to the Overwatch loot box system, if you ever played that). Lastly, the player can also buy houses, mansions & even some old castles. They don't do much other than looking great or bragging rights and setting the player closer to the desired location on the map. Some will give special perks, however, like double Forzathon points or the ability to fast travel.

The game has no micro-transaction. There are no pay-to-win vehicles in the game. But yes, some paid vehicles from DLCs might be better & cheaper or even free upon purchases compared to what someone can get in the standard version of the game, but just so you know; ""The only thing that matters is who is behind the wheel. ‚Äï Dominic Toretto"".

As for the performance, I also own the game on the Microsoft Store & the difference between the two is significant. The game can have a few hiccups here & there if I'm multitasking too much. But it could be something to do with my crappy HDD or just the heat. I'm running this game on a 2018 gaming laptop, after all. I have to mention I only crashed once, which was during a loading screen right when someone was about to watch me play via Steam Broadcast. But overall, unlike some people who have mentioned a few crashed or massive stuttering, I have been playing hours just fine with a constant 60 FPS on High / Ultra (Custom preset).

Well, that's about it for now! I hope that this review was helpful to you! And I'm sincerely sorry for this wall of text! Feel free to comment down below if you want to know more about the game, or if you wish to correct something I said even though you probably own the game already & you're just a curious person! Either way, I appreciate it!

P.S: To play in a convoy with friends, you need the old ""Xbox Console Companion"" app.",1
140,RIP The Crew now that Forza is on Steam!,1
141,This is so British that even Top Gear is in this.,1
142,"The best racing game i've ever played since ""Need for Speed: Most Wanted (2005)"" -The Legend-
It's a yes. If you look for just one racing game, then it should be this piece of art. This game doesn't let you be in search of any other racing game. Graphics are amazing but optimization in this game is way better. If you can afford, i recommend you to buy ultimate edition, u ll get so many excellent and fastest cars nearly right from the beginning which earns u so much time. There are plenty of people playing the game right now in online mode too. Overall i recommend this game 9/10 for sure.
Take care everyone!!!  üëç üëç üëç",1

150,"Cons:
- CONSTANT crashing (5/3/2021)
- Online adventure is garbage (Long loading times, rammers, etc.)
- Terrible rewind feature in online racing 
- Bunch of rammers that pushing you out of checkpoints as you try to overtake them (This is why I don‚Äôt play ranked/unranked mode anymore)
- No punishment for rammers",1
151,"I‚Äôve never played any Forza games before as I don‚Äôt own a console, also haven‚Äôt been interested in buying games outside of Steam, even though I love arcade racers. Heard the name of the series of course, and that it‚Äôs basically a synonym of quality content. Once FH4 has been announced on Steam, I waited eagerly, even tried the demo through Windows Store.

Having previously played mostly Codemasters‚Äô racing titles, I am amazed now that I‚Äôve had the chance to fiddle with the full version. The sheer amount of content present is let alone one of its strongest selling points.

Although base map isn‚Äôt the largest, it‚Äôs thought out well. The multitude of event types available left me speechless ‚Äì you have everything here in one game that is sometimes scattered between several different titles. I especially like cross-country events because huge verticality of the map in many regions makes them so fun and crazy.

There are rewinds/flashbacks ‚Äì missed so much in all the latest titles from Codemasters. There is an extensive story mode with dedicated multi-part quests. Online mode is regularly updated with new rewarding challenges and playlists, but offline mode also has a voluntary online element implemented in a way I found very refreshing. You see other players driving through the map, can pick up challenges created by them or take part in simultaneous activities called Forzathon Live. Story mode races have an option to tackle them solo or in couple different online variants.

The graphics is great, the handling very pleasing, the number of cars overwhelms. No such good things can be said about engine sounds, but after few hours I stopped finding them irritating. There are several diverse radio stations ‚Äì quite OK but that‚Äôs a matter of personal taste. Creating your own station is not possible. The level of fun factor hits through the roof. This is a title that can be easily played for years.

The bad? Steam port is not as ideal in terms of performance as Windows Store version as of now. There are occasional stutters. For me most of them happen within cut-scenes which fortunately are very short in this game. I've also read there are problems with steering wheels. Developers have already started working on fixes.

If you‚Äôre into arcade racers, I can‚Äôt imagine anything on Steam as captivating as this pricey gem. 9/10

UPDATE: Around summer 2021 Steam stuttering had been fixed. The game plays in that regard just as good as Windows Store version now.",1
152,"It's a great game at face value, but the steam port is unplayable due to constant stuttering. You can't tell me it's my hardware, I just built a new rig with an RTX 3080 and a Core i9-10850k. The framerate is great, visuals are stunning, but the cinematics and free-roam modes are essentially useless due to stuttering. The steam release of the game is only about 3 weeks old at the time I'm posting this, so I can only hope maybe they will eventually fix these problems with a patch. For now I would recommend the microsoft store version. Don't get swindled like me.

EDIT: In my case at least, this issue has mostly been patched. It's still somewhat buggy but the game is far more playable now. I would still say buy it on Microsoft store or gamepass, but if you buy it here, you'll hopefully be okay.",1

156,"Forza Horizon 4 is remarkable game. It's a racer that's for everybody, instantly accessible for people who don't play racing games, but with enough depth and difficulty to satisfy gamers who prefer simulation. The very premise of Horizon 4 is fun. The quirky, bouncy voice-overs and the festival vibe keeps things free and light-hearted. Races are aimed at creating tight, balanced races that are fun no matter what vehicle you drive, and it does this well. It's fun to just jump in a random race you find.

There is a lot of depth to the game, multiple race disciplines keep things interesting and all are genuinely fun. If you get bored of one discipline you can jump in another and get the hang of it really quickly. It doesn't force you through awkward drifting mini-games or shift orientated drag races.

Graphically the game is stunning. There is no other word, the cars and environments are photo-realistic. Set any screenshot as my desktop background and I wouldn't even suspect it wasn't the Lake District. The cars themselves look fantastic, lighting is done very well.

The seasons mechanics is one of the main attractions to Forza Horizon 4 and have to say it is an interesting one. Certain driving disciplines are more tailored to different seasons, so Winter is good for dirt for example, and Summer more for road racing, and that can get frustrating if you want to change seasons. Seasons are locked to the servers, meaning every week they change, you can't change them in game by moving ahead seasons for example. Each season though does look amazing in it's own way, and adds diversity to game campaign.

The long game though is predictably more tailored towards casual gamers. It can be easy to get a big roster of cars without actually having bought one yourself. In this way the game can be easy if you're more of a simulation racer, but Forza Horizon 4 isn't trying to be.

Pros

-Beautiful graphics
-Embodiment of fun
-Accessible to all types of gamers
-Reasonable roster of cars
-Celebration of car culture
-Good map
-Fantastic amount of tuning ability

Cons

-Season mechanic can get old, with no way to change to a favourable season
-Extensively long tutorial; which keeps you in single player until it's complete
-Generally gameplay music is not my cup of tea. That's why I listen to my own radio stations in the background when I play this masterpiece:P

Forza Horizon 4 is a beautiful game, well polished and full of cars and stunning environments. One more for the casual crowd but fun nonetheless, a fantastic celebration of car culture.

Note: All of these ideas are based on ~150 hours of playing experience on the Microsoft Store. You can be sure to see more here^^",1
157,"This game rocks, but it crashes on Steam every few minutes. pLEASE FIX THIS.",0
158,"Did you ever go to a friends house to play a new video game? Imagine if you did, and your friend handed you the controller to try the game but every 5 minutes he snatches it out of your hand because he wants to ""show you something really quick"". That is what it feels like to play Forza Horizon 4.

After about 4 hours of gameplay I have become enraged by jarring gameplay decisions. The ""story"" (basically the games way of guiding you between missions you unlock) frequently forces you to pause, steals your control away to demonstrate something, or forces you into an annoying unskippable cutscene or monologue from a ""story"" member while it highlights the new mission on my map as though I'm a child who has never held a controller. 

As if that wasn't annoying enough; the game frequently forces you to watch minute long ADVERTISEMENTS for their purchaseable car packs as part of this. I could look past this if it was concealed even in the most lazy way, like part of a load screen, or an in game billboard... but the game literally pulls me out of active gameplay to force me to watch an advertisement. Apparently the only way to get this to stop from happening is to buy ALL of the DLC. Or you can pay $100 to simply have it all when you purchase the game. I'm legitimately so annoyed by this that I would refund the game if I could but I gathered too much time before the ads became more pronounced in the gameplay, and I'm willing to bet that's no accident. 

This is such a massive stain on an otherwise fun game. I feel bad for the people who poured their heart into the game only to have some upper-echelons finance-bro come along and take a steaming shit on it and then scoot around like an overweight bulldog smearing their still wet anusprint across the hard work their underlings did.",0

It's like if Battlefield 3/4 were a racing game... there's constant engagement, constant unlocks, tons of events and cars to unlock. This and Forza Horizon 5 (playing on Gamepass) are a time sink, which I say happily :)",1

163,"[h3]I've gone to the Horizon and I have seen the edge[/h3]
At the end of the day, Forza Horizon 4 is an approachable racer. But I bought it for use as a sort of  'checklist simulator'. Checklist games, as I call them, express a dichotomy of reality that is both very banal yet relatively satisfying at the same time. To make a long story... shorter ‚Äî Forza Horizon 4 is a fun, but fleeting experience.

[h3]Gameplay[/h3]
A live, open-world with a number of racing and/or driving events.

[b]‚ÄúWorld Events‚Äù[/b]
There are more than this but they all are based around these types of objectives.
‚Ä¢ [b]Danger Signs[/b] ‚Äì jumping off a cliff or ramp, competing for distance.
‚Ä¢ [b]Trailblazer[/b] ‚Äì off-road point to point race.
‚Ä¢ [b]Speed trap[/b] ‚Äì specific spot to reach certain speed.
‚Ä¢ [b]Speed zones[/b] ‚Äì same thing as a speed trap but has a designated zone to build speed.

[b]‚ÄúStory‚Äù[/b] missions typically have some additional objective on top of it being a point to point race with a cut scene in front of it. Objectives like staying over a certain speed the whole time, staying on roads, don't cause X amount of damage. Something arbitrary yet repeatable. The Cross Country events ended up being one the better events, they felt the most like Test-Drive Off-Road on PS1. Or even the original ‚Äú1nsane‚Äù on PC which holds a special place in my heart.

You can use a drone to explore the world. I pretty much used it exclusively to search for barns where you can find old cars to repair and add to your garage, but you can use it to just look around and relax as well.

[b]Downsides[/b]
Tracks are not terribly memorable due to be made out of the open world. You may remember locations such as the quarry but nothing specific about any of the turns within. There are also custom user made events that can be rated up or down ‚Äî vaguely akin to something like Trials: Rising. Some events have almost no restrictions regarding vehicle type, allowing super cars onto rally tracks and vice versa. Leading to significantly odd experiences. Without racing a Pelican against a Warthog from Halo or racing a hovercraft against a dune buggy, the game can get a little tiresome from the lack of depth in the driving itself. But that's what this series is going for. Low barrier for entry, maximum fun gambit.
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2832281470

All that said, there were a few points I became overwhelmed by the shear amount of events and activities to do where I had a minor panic attack and needed to step away from the game. I eventually turned off the online notifications that I was bombarded with from all the timed events. Luckily, the game has a considerable number of customization features; everything from difficulty, physics, AI and UI/HUD elements. Upon completion of an event, you'll be surrounded with numbers. Numbers that probably mean something to someone, but in reality they amount to very little. But they keep going up and that makes your brain happy. In addition to this, completing an event will also add ‚Äî usually ‚Äî around three or five new events to the map.
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2832281517

[h3]Comparison shopping[/h3]
While I would like to compare the two Forza IPs against the two DiRT IPs, in reality, they aren't similar at all and the real market demographic they share looks more like Forza Motorsports vs Gran Turismo and Forza Horizon vs Need For Speed(?) maybe Test Drive Unlimited(?). 

The reason I bring up DiRT is that the main DiRT series has become pretty arcade-y while its spinoff series ‚ÄúDiRT Rally‚Äù is the more simulation focused one. Forza has gone the complete opposite direction in Forza Motorsports being the main, simulation-based series and its spinoff on ‚ÄúHorizon‚Äù being the arcade venture. Which I just find interesting.

Another thing about this comparison is that I believe the Need for Speed IP has taken a hit as far as ‚Äúclout‚Äù ‚Äî it simply doesn't have the same power it used to. And I believe that EA feels the same way, which is why they have outright purchased Codemasters obtaining the DiRT, GRID and F1 IPs/licenses.

[h3]DLC Expansions[/h3]
Fortune Island is a little bit Disney Land, a little bit Jurassic Park. It's exactly as you'd expect. It's an island with the same style races, events, speed traps, danger signs etc. It's very much [i]more[/i] Forza Horizon 4, only smaller.

LEGO Valley is my favorite DLC for the game. However, it's effectively no different from the main game aside from the aesthetics. There is a component of acquiring LEGO bricks to build a home as opposed to buying one outright ‚Äî but realistically, much like the main game, it doesn't really amount to much beyond achievements. 

[h3]The Gist[/h3]
I think it's a fun game, but I don't think it's a [i]great[/i] game. If you're looking for something that resembles racing and want some trivial tasks to accomplish, this game will suit you just fine. But it's missing that 'something special'. It's a play through one time sort of affair. And while fun, pandering for a bit of fan service ‚Äî the showcase events feel so contrived they may as well have been ads. The whole game feels like it's just a shell.

I've played this game for hours on PC already thanks to Xbox Game Pass, and now I have it on Steam.

First I wanna talk about the new features real quick I've found so far:
 - Cross-play (Something only needed cause of this new version)
 - Compatibility with Game Capture in OBS (FINALLY)
 - Steam Cloud Save (Hopefully you can now reset your save easier)
 - Steam Cards & Point Shop items (Sure?)

Then, and this might just be my PC, but it seems this game isn't really fully stable, every time I start driving it starts to stutter a bit, every time I pass the finish line the entire game freezes for like 2 seconds, so might be worth sticking with the Windows 10 version if you wish to keep it smooth.

Finally, I wanna mention the price, 70 euros for the Standard, 90 for Deluxe, and 100!!! for the Ultimate Edition, I know that this is kinda close to the Windows store prices, but MY GOD it's still a lot for a game that isn't really that new, so while I appreciate the slight discount, I still fell like these aren't the prices you to attract new players.

So all in all, this is mostly just the Xbox/Windows version, so unless you REALLY can't live without the new Steam features, I feel you're properly better off with getting yourself an Xbox Game Pass for PC, and then buying the DLCs in the Windows 10 store.

*If they manage to fix the stutter, freezing & even get some more attractive prices, that can make it wort buying the game fully on Steam, instead of just getting the Xbox Game Pass, I'll be more than happy to either edit or remove this review :)",1
188,Forza Horizon 4 weened me off of The Witcher 3.  Nothing in sight that will ween me off of Forza Horizon 4.,1
189,"Driving in this game is ecstatic.

The gist:
It has a lot of UX quirks, but when it comes to driving experience it is second to none.
It looks great, sounds great, feels great.

Longplay:
First of all I must note that I'm playing with DualShock 4.

I must admit that I mostly played arcade racing games before (with most roots in NFS series since Porsche Unleashed in 2000s, playing via keyboard), but at first DiRT 4 and then Forza Horizon 4 made me strive for more, over time I kept disabling more and more assists, and at the moment of writing, I am 100% comfortable with almost all of them disabled, save for 'braking' overlay (racing) line and 'automatic' gearbox.

It's worth noting that almost everything [u]online[/u] in my experience with it, was a little bit shoddy. The only thing that works consistently well is shared open world and its little events ‚Äì Forzathon Live, of which I played a chunk. I think the problem might be because the game doesn't punish leaving the match in any way, so when you try to play something PvP (or co-op vs difficult NPC drivers), there are a lot of people who just leave when things go sour. [strike]From my limited ranked experience it wasn't the case in it, though.[/strike] Team Ranked is absolutely broken, and in more ways than one: with how points work in the game, a team with fewer players has a huge advantage, and in all of my dozens of attempts to play Team Ranked, I had players leaving mid-match (it's the same for solo play too, but at least there it doesn't impact your ability to gain rating, altough the play experience suffers greatly still). Games are played in a best of 5 format, and it's not unusual to have a team leading 2-0 with first rounds because overall they played better, but as some players leave on the opposing team, they end up losing 2-3, and it's mostly on the points system (it's a bit complicated to explain, but the general idea is: the amount of points you get is fixed to the number of players you overtook). Oh, and I have a bug, which I had since my purchase 7 months ago, where my Team Ranked rating won't change past what was given during initial monthly calibration. My verdict is that the game is absolutely not viable for PvP competetive play. There is a cool Battle Royale mode, but players for it are far and few in-between, and it might get stale pretty quick (I've had enough after total 5.5 hours of it).
Also, I haven't tried much to play co-op with my friends, but from exactly 1 session of couple of hours, it worked fine for our party of two.

Another important thing to note is how season change is set up: after you play your initial tutorial-ish-like first year round of events, which amounts to about 10 to 15 hours of playtime, depending on how fast you will earn experience points, the seasons are set up in a form of a live service, they last for exactly 1 week of real time (changing at Thursdays at 2:30PM GMT), and there is nothing you can do to change it for the open world. You still are able to play racing events themselves in different seasons from the current one, but open world and things that depend on it, like 'Stories' - sets of story missions with some plot, are dependant on the server season. Which might get a little bit annoying if you try to do some things for the maximum score at winter (with winter obviously being the most difficult season to drive in).

On an absolutely positive front: the game is incredibly well optimized, it looks absolutely beautiful, with great weather effects and dynamic world: most elements on the track, stuff like small trees and fences, are destructible, it has a terrific real-time sand and snow terrain deformation, and ofcourse it has a full day/night cycle! The only game that comes to my mind in terms of technical wizardry which is on par is DOOM Eternal.

Also, if you are thinking on what sort of edition should you buy: I can't be your only source of information on that, but for me, expansions alone were worth it (and Ultimate at the base price costs about the same as the base game + expansion pass, in most regions). They provide pretty different experience from the main map. So, I have the Ultimate Edition. VIP status with its extra rewards was a nice bonus in helping to grow my car assemblage, but right now I have over 88,000,000 credits (which is a lot) and all of the houses bought, as well as over 600 unique cars in my collection, so I think that the VIP status wasn't essential as I have yet to drive half of my autopark. And regarding packs of cars - well, I have yet to drive many of them, but I must admit that some cars from the Welcome Pack were both feeling great and incredibly competent for the online play (as is, with no alterations to their tuning), but I wouldn't exactly claim it as ""pay to win"" because with good community tuning setups you can substitute them with many other car models for their respective classes. So if you would decide to buy the base game, you'll probably get the most of what the game can offer, and if it really clicked with you, you might get an expansion pass on a sale afterwards.

If you are contemplating between buying Forza Horizon 5 or this, I think it's worth noting that a friend of mine, who bought FH5, still came back to play FH4 from time to time, because he hasn't finished everything it has to offer beforehand. I'm only planning on picking up FH5 someday, but from what I gathered, it's mostly about what map you want to drive in. And winter alone in FH4 makes it so much different from FH5, that it's worth picking up. But don't take only my word for it, ofcourse. Still, FH4 is a must-buy at -65% or so.

There is a lot to say of what might be a little annoying for you in terms of UX, e.g. things like UI layout, how upgrading is set up, or how long it takes just to change a color of your car... but in my opinion, it's all insignificant when compared to driving experience. The map of the game is so fun to drive in and to explore, and all of the seasons have different driving feel to them, while looking absolutely astonishing. And when ""Subtact - Tunnel Vision"" starts playing, you are on the verge of tears from the pure joy of automotive celebration. It's just incredibly beautiful experience all around.",1
190,"Great game. Way 2 expensive

Also crashes and stuttering still isn't fixed

I personally really miss a custom radio station with imported music like in GTA or Horizon 3
or AT LEAST have an option to disable all in-game music so you would be able to just play your own music from other app

Edit: Crashing, stuttering and infinite loading issues still haven't been fixed. This is unacceptable.",0
191,"Every Forza horizon game has been a step up in terms of quality and content, but none of the Forza games has ever reached the amount of hours I feel like I can put into these games since Forza Motorsport 4 till I was able to get my hands on horizon 4. 

This game isn't flawless just like all the other Forza games but it has something that I can't point to which makes it so special and worth my time to keep playing for hours and not get tired, that's why I'll point out every flaw that I have noticed so everything else that I don't mention, I feel is everything that makes this game worth playing.

The NPC's dialogue feels like a massive corporation (Microsoft) trying to relate to people on twitter, it's cringy, it's corny and it's safe. No actual humor and no actual characters that you can like. It's a good thing that it's not too much execpt for in the beginning of the game which might be hard to listen to.

This is probably the biggest turn off for online play for me. You can't mute everyone. People usually have their mic on by default and just forget about it. When ever I get into an online race some people have their mic on, they don't speak. All you can hear is them eating, talking to their friends or their dog is barking in the background. It's really annoying and the only way you can mute them is when the race starts you have to pause the game and select individual players and mute them one by one. Which makes your car stop accelerating and turn. So if you're winning then you have to sit there having to hear some other persons entire life around them.

That's all that bothers me about this game. Everything else is worth the hours I'll spend on this.",1

194,"Not a review, just a recommendation.",1
195,"Ultimate Edition review.

Great graphics, lots of stuff to do, fun online events/connectivity...you know what everyone says.

But there's two things I cannot STAND. 

The menus and ui are horrible. My God. There's loads of important things buried between tabs, menus, and different shape and size boxes selecting just simple stuff. Played the game for 76 hours and never got used to the ui. Plus, passive notifications after you do something don't tell you enough information a lot of the time, which means you gotta go back into the menus. It actually drove me nuts. Probably the worst aspect of the game. Notifications are also very obtrusive (FH5 is slightly better though about the notifications but still needs improvement). 

The seconds thing is progression. It's cool to earn cars, but when you get a fast car early on, there's no reason to want/buy slower cars. You can do any event in almost any class car anyway. There's also no real story. There's a narrator here and there but it's extremely bland. There's events called ""story"" that each have about 8-10 separate things to do, but again, it's bland. What's worse, every single camera angle and panning Is. Exactly. The. Same. Both characters are in the exact same spot with the character who is talking to you conveniently has their back to you, probably as a way for the dev to save time/money so they don't have to do lipsync. However there was one ""story"" that was really fun and exciting to me. It involved going through a history of racing video games which was awesome. 

So basically it's just do stuff, get car. They try to spice it up a bit by added wheelspins and super wheelspins where you can earn cash, emotes, clothing, horns and of course more cars. But a lot of those wheelspins have some really terrible low value ""prizes"" too. One game that did both of these things right was The Crew 2. I know, a Ubi game. But the menu navigation, progression and notifications are spot on. And the game is still supported as of this review too. 

It may sound like I'm being too hard on the game but no, I had a lot of fun. I did every event, found every collectible and did the same for Fortune Valley and The Lego expansion. I bought at a discount for $35 plus the $3 dollar treasure map because I'm lazy. Got a lot of playtime on this one, however also consider I got The Crew 2 for just $10 on sale with the better ui on top and I played that for almost 60 hours with more event variety and plenty left to do, I'd go for either the base game of FH4 or The Crew 2.  

-------------------------------
Fortune Valley:

Basically it's a much smaller map with the exact same event types and stories. For some reason I though there were going to be natural disasters in this one, but nope. 

-------------------------------
Lego DLC

An even smaller map with much less to do. There's an excessive grind if you want to complete the Master Builder though. And the challenges are again, laid out poorly in a grid of I think 16*17. Oh my God is horrible. You always earn toward them even if they're not pinned but you can only pin one at a time which was annoying.  Also, there's no passive notifications during gameplay telling you how far you are in something you just triggered and maybe didn't know it.",1
196,Buy this game .  so you do not play NFS games .,1
197,"Arguably the best racing game out right now. Have played it for way too many hours on the MS Store version since around christmas 2019 and now bought it on Steam too since it was finally discounted. I personally didn't mind having to start over due to saves not transfering over, don't mind the grind.

The game seems to have some issues on Steam that I'm sure they'll fix in future updates but nothing major, atleast not for me. Game crashed twice in the first hour of playing on this platform but after disabling the in-game overlay in GeForce Experience it has been smooth sailing since. Had similar issues with that in other games too so it was a natural thing to test. Might be worth trying for anyone suffering from random crashes but there's no guarantee the same trick works for everyone.",1

It keeps crashing for no reason. I have a rig that can support Ultra graphics and yet it just plops you back into reality.

And it did not start doing that until I got past the two hour mark. Now I cannot get my money back until this thing is fixed. This better be fixed because this is absolute dung! GOOD DAY TO YOU SIR!",0

-faulty mess: has too many graphical bugs and crashes randomly (Cyberpunk is more playable)
-sounds are unreal but not awful (can be annoying for car guys)
-leaderboards are filled with cheaters that complete a 9KM course in 0.01 second (almost first 1500s are cheaters)
-game can get stuck in photo mode (loading forever till you alt+f4)
-can't choose your own season and you are stuck with whatever season current week is (winter for example)
-sometimes kicks you out of a session once you complete a race with friends' convoy and starts looking for a new one automatically but don't worry, it loads session in the background and jumps directly to it without interrupting your game",1

205,"The best way to describe the game for me is to say : It's the best racing/driving game i've played so far. This is only my opinion and i haven't played most simulation heavy titles. I like the balance between Sim x Arcade in this game. 

Probably worth mentioning that im able to play the game 2k with max settings and its one of the best looking games i've played aswell. I play it on a controller and can't even imagine the feels when you run this thing with a good wheel setup. You should definitely get this game if you like any car culture by any bit honestly. 

I've heard some people say the game was freezing and stuff before i bought the game but i did buy it anyways and never had a single issue with it. It's smooth as silk for me. 

My setup if anyone wonders : i7 - 10700k , RTX 2070 SUPER ROG STRIX OC 8GB , 32gb Ram , Samsung 970 Evo 500GB. 
If you have something similar, you can take my word that it's smooth af without any problems on 2k + max.

2. Recycled car sounds.

212,"Forza Horizon 4 is built around seasons. In its opening moments you drive a McLaren Senna across autumnal country roads, race a Polaris RZR across a frozen winter lake, skid through mud in a Ford Fiesta in spring, before hopping back into the Senna for a road trip on a clear summer's day. It's a montage of the series' trademark aspirational playground, here tailored to maximise the differences between its seasonal shifts.

It's an emotive tour through what's to come. Once you reach the festival site, you play through each season individually across a five-hour prologue that introduces Forza Horizon 4's many different events. Had this been the game proper, it would have been enough. You complete events to build influence, hitting milestones to progress to the next season in a manner similar to unlocking new festival sites in Forza Horizon 3. But after you've completed a full loop‚Äîsummer to spring‚ÄîForza Horizon 4 reveals its final form.

Especially since I have never owned a racing game other than Mariokart, which was a game I grew up with, it was a nice change of pace. Forza Horizon 4 also psychologically benefited me. I was personally scared of driving because of how dangerous, stressful, and unpredictable it can be. And the game helped me overcome a lot of that and made me feel more comfortable with driving in my life. The game also helped me with my stress just because of how relaxing the game is. It takes your mind into a colorful and calming atmosphere where you don't have to worry or think about anything. As for the game itself, it's always entertaining. There are so many activities you can do around the world of Forza Horizon 4 that it's insane, so you'll have lots of playtime in this game, even more, if you include some of the DLCs.

238,"tl;dr Awesome singleplayer, horrendous multiplayer

This is a review about the base game of Forza Horizon 4.

[b] Since the character limit for reviews on Steam is apparently ~8000 I had to cut out 2100.
If youre interested youll find the full review in the comments of the linked video. [/b]

Even though I now have nearly 200 hours in the game, I still have to leave a negative review. Dont get me wrong, if you're looking for a great open world singleplayer racing game the fourth installment of the Forza Horizon series is definitely for you!
Ill start off with some of the positives before it turns more towards a rant about the multiplayer.
The graphics are really insane. It comes with a huge map you can roam free about with different sceneries ranging from sandy beaches through lush forest up to rocky mountains onto long open highways into tight cornered cities.
The game comes with dynamic weather and a day & night cycle, paired with a weekly changing season. Seasonal changes make the map evermore fun, surfaces change significant in the wet or the snow.
Not only this but the map is littered with loads of challenges and collectibles next to tons of races.
To make things even more enticing there's a weekly/monthly changing festival playlist which lets you unlock all kinds of stuff from cars to cosmetics.
A quick word about the story: Good mixture between Dirt, Offroad, Street & Night races paired with a variety of side stories and neat business options you can master. I don't think anyone can complain about those. And even if the number of story races isn't enough for you don't worry. FH4 comes with the blueprint option which lets you customize not only already existent races but lets you design your very own races, challenges & events.
Within the base game are 640 unique cars from over 80 manufacturers. The cars come with great customizability livery wise, sufficient tuning and really detailed fine tuning options so everybody can get the perfect set up for themselves.
Two more things that deserve a shoutout imo are the camera feature which lets you take awesome snapshots from your car in every location. Packed with different filters and features you can get really creative with it. Plus you can upload them directly from in the game.
The other stand out feature are the radio hosts. Holy moly. The amount of unique dialogue each of the 6 hosts from the different stations has is insane. They have a comment for nearly everything that's going on.

Now that we have spread some love its time to get to the downsides of the game.
First of all an Xbox account is required to play the game and you need to link it and log in every time you wanna play. 
While I've praised the radio, the season changes and the camera feature earlier I still have to add some negative aspects.
You've got 6 different radio stations to chose from but after already a few hours each of the stations with their what feels like 5 different songs gets repetitive real quick. I miss the feature which lets you add your own custom songs to the radio. Forza Horizon 3 had this in form of Groove Music, bummer they didn't add this here.
I highlighted the weekly changing season earlier as something that brings a nice mixup to the map and the driving style. That might be 1 the first 2-3 times. But it gets annoying to be stuck in winter for a week when all you want to do is cruise along sunny beaches. I can see the purpose of it in multiplayer but why cant we pick our own season in singleplayer :/
Another big problem I have is the fact that you cant modify liveries or tuning setups that you've downloaded from other players. If you want to change only the tiniest of things you have to wipe the entire setup and start from scratch. 
You cant turn off Drivatars/Bots in singleplayer. It might makes the world feel more alive but if I just wanna cruise along without avoiding speedbumbs its troublesome. And trust me, they are annoying. Especially if youre trying to complete or set records on certain jumps or trying to get a run up for a Speedtrap.

Now onto some more serious problems.
The steam port for the game was made ‚Äûby Playground Games in partnership with Sumo Nottingham‚Äú aka Sumo Notthingham did it. Why do you need an extra port for Steam if its already on PC? And why for gods sake is there no real steering wheel support?? I've got a Logitech G920 and its just not working. It recognizes the wheel and you can press some buttons and pads but you cant control the car. Even after two fresh setups and fine tuning the controls I'm unable to get it working properly. Coming from the DiRT & Project Cars series where it was a plug and play experience to Forza where it isn't working at all is really frustrating. And trust me, I'm not the only Steam player that couldn't get his steering wheel to work.
To the release policy. The game was originally released on the 28th September 2018 for Xbox and the Microsoft store on Windows. It came to Steam on March 9th 2021. It took them 1 and a half years to made up their minds and get that joke of a port ready. I got the Ultimate Edition which costs 99,99‚Ç¨ without discounts. Included are only 7/15 available DLCs ... excuse meee?? I would have to pay 57,92‚Ç¨ more to unlock EVERYTHING eventho I already have the ULTIMATE Edition??? Men I dont know
Forza Horizon 5 was announced on June 13th and as of June 30th there's no new content for Horizon 4, all they do is recycle stuff from previous weeks for challenges. That's roughly 16 weeks / 4 month of Steam support if you want. And while they have added consistently new content in that time frame they didn't do shit concerning bugs and lags. No wheel support, the barn finds are still not showing in the garage and don't even get me started on the servers, we¬¥ll get to them soon.
So overall I paid 100‚Ç¨ for an Ultimate Edition that is not Ultimate at all, for only 4 months of new content, for no real support and no bug fixes and trash servers?  That all feels just like a cheap cash grab given FH5 was announced so short after the Steam release. At least FH5 will be on Steam from the beginning.

Too be honest, I could look over all the aforementioned problems and celebrate Forza Horizon 4 as the great game it should be if it wasn't for all these multiplayer issues.
Let me get it clear, the multiplayer servers are dogshit garbage, EA servers are godlike compared to them.
Coming from a company like Microsoft this is inexcusable. And it wasn't like we had problem once or twice. It took us consistently 15-20 minutes, sometimes even hours to form a group, play on the same server and start an event together. Same goes for waiting times for any kind of online adventure or even ranked matches. And if you finally made it and everybody was still in the race the race itself was just a clown fiesta. Ill link a [url=https://youtu.be/8w7AjVWn_QM] Video [/url] [I] (click it) [/i] here showcasing some of the great multiplayer experiences Forza brought me (: It was really fun to race clean, smooth and lagfree with other players/bots. :^)  
The next issue, there are apparently some people you cant mute?? I had turned on the option to mute everyone and everything yet there were still some people that had their mic active at all times. And boi oh boi do I love hearing British television over some Spanish family drama in my 15minute ranked loading screen :-).
And another BIG ISSUE are the lap times in multiplayer or rather the absence of them. In the singleplayer you see both fastest lap and total time for you and the bots at the end of the race. In multiplayer you don't. Explain to me how a online multiplayer racing game doesn't show you the laptimes of your opponents at the end of the race or who got the fastest lap. I cant believe it.

So overall its a great experience in singleplayer but if you want to play with your friends online you better pray that you have a better experience than I did. I really cant recommend the online mode of Forza Horizon 4.",0

246,"Unfortunately, it's a complete and utter COIN FLIP whether this game will work or not on your PC. Random crashes every 30 minutes, until you get so unlucky that your game is completely stuck in a crash loop after pressing Continue. Abysmal PC support. Frequent crashing issues have been an ongoing problem even BEFORE the Steam version, and still to this day have not been fixed. AVOID.",0
247,"This review is actually mixed, but I upvote mine, cuz the game it's still awesome. And I finally can stream the blasted thing because it's not an UWP, thanks heavens.

What is not awesome, is the current state of Steam version:

- RU locale is missing entire chunks of text, literally empty buttons and prompts are everywhere. Steam-exclusive bug.
- No sound in logo vids at all, sometimes game play them in window and they are not full screen. Steam-exclusive bug.
- Absolutley strange freezes between race and game screens and other servie menus. On gen4 ssd. That's new, never had this problem with my UWP game. Steam-exclusive bug.
- XBL login screen on 4K displays is a joke, huge text crammed in a tiny window you can't even change the size of.
- Huge middle finger to Horizon 4 UWP owners in terms of some sort of cross-saves or cross-progression. I need to repeat the tedious hour and a half of tutorial races once again. And none of my liveries and other stuff like plates are in sync. You're still usign the gorram XBL, is it really that hard, Microsoft?

TL;DR

If you're new to the series, then great. FH4 is a terrific game that's totally worth a shot. Best arcade racer out there. This version is also OBS-friendly and works with overlays. Some strange stutters and random tech issues, that are suprisingly exclusive to Steam, may spoil some fun. But it's still functional, mind you.

Personally for me, it's just sad that with XBL link in place there is no meaningful sync between your Xbox/WinStore progression and Steam saves.",1
248,"FH4 is the best racing game I've ever played. Pretty much every racing game falls into one of two categories, arcade or simulation. Arcade racing games are fun for a couple days or maybe a couple weeks, but they generally lack replayability and I've never known anybody to play an arcade racer for a long period of time. Racing sims don't at all align with my idea of ""fun"". I know there are a lot of people out there who are passionate about super realistic racing sims, but those games are not for me and I think most people would agree that it's a niche genre. I cannot stress enough how impressive it is to make a game that appeals to both of these groups. Now I understand why Forza Horizon has such a dedicated fanbase. It appeals to such a wide group of people without making any compromises.

The game is extremely beautiful and absurdly well optimized. There are more cars available than I could ever need or want. There are sooooo many progression systems that make you feel like you're getting somewhere instead of just playing for the sake of playing. The UI design is gorgeous yet functional. There are a ton of customization options for your character and car. The auction house is decently well thought out, and I've personally decided to grow my wealth by flipping cars instead of grinding races. You are free to play as competitively or as casually as you would like. You can have fun the way you want to have fun, the game will never get in your way of that.

There's no NOS or turbo in this game, no unrealistic drifting, you can't control your car mid-air, etc... It's realistic in all the right places, yet it's not too realistic to the point where it loses its fun. The Forza Horizon series is truly the best blend in the racing game genre. It's hard for me to imagine someone who wouldn't enjoy it.",1

254,"Best racing game that I've ever bought on Steam! I remember that I first started playing this on my old GTX 660 Ti, that old beast struggled even at low settings, but I still enjoyed the game and spent hours and hours in it. After a while I got the 4K experience with an R9 Nano, and then with an RTX 3060. The game just looks so good at 4K, that I've never wanted to go back to 1080p lol So yeah, after 100+ hrs of playtime, I'm still launching this game (I've completed all the races, events etc), even if I just freeroam or just drive, because it's just good you know. Also wanted to get all the Achievements, but sadly there are a few that are bugged so I just kinda gave up on that dream.

259,"Game worth a buy if you're new to the game, and probably not if you already own MSFT store edition. If you're a veteran then keep in mind that your progression DOES NOT transfer from MSFT account. Also RT/LT triggers DON'T vibrate on new Xbox controllers (Impulse Triggers), while in MSFT version of the game they DO (developers are working on a fix, according to received support ticket reply).
Some people report issues with wheels.
Game is definitely better than Crew and Crew 2 where physics is a bit... wonky. 
Pricing in some countries is horrible, but I honestly don't mind if it will help release FH5.

UPD: game is definitely more stable than at ""launch"" on Steam. It is playable atm.",1
260,"Nutshell review:

--> ‚úì BUDGET: Got it for 700 PHP (or 14 USD) on sale. I highly don't recommend other editions aside from the Ultimate Edition as you'll be missing out a LOT OF CARS. Also I don't think the game is worth it if it's not on sale as GRINDING is moderately to highly present and also Forza Horizon 5 is already out.

--> ‚úì OVERALL GAME: the game focuses on the player collecting cars through different ways such as participating in a race, a battle royale event, drift event and a whole lot more. You can also play with your buddy and other people in a ""session"" to go do a lot of stuff, like literally a lot. GRAPHICS foockin looks realistic and arguably way ahead of other modern racing games!!! It has a SIM RACING driving mechanic so you might find it hard to control the cars at first if you're used to arcade racing such as NFS games. ATTENTION TO DETAIL is also widely implemented such as car damage, moving vegetations cause of the wind, weather changes which affects the tire grip and such. GAME MAP is also wide and doesn't restrict you from going to places even if you are just starting. CAR CUSTOMIZATION is a bit off, focuses mainly on performance and livery making, it lacks bodykit choices (most cars don't have bodykits). PLAYER AVATARS/CHARACTERS are also customizable but don't expect much from that as this is a car game not a Sims kinda game. OVERALL IT'S A GREAT GAME!

X --> Weekly or Seasonal rotations. You can't get the car you sometimes want coz they are not available and you can't choose which season you want so that's one bummer. Only way to get those cars is through auction house which mostly is on a high price.

X --> REQUIRES XBOX account (just some FYI, it's a downside for some people)

P.S. SUPRA A80 GO STUTUUTUTU!!! YEAH YOU CAN BUILD THE KIND OF SUPRA YOU'VE ALWAYS WANTED ON A RACING GAME COZ HERE, IT'S FAST, IT DRIFTS, AND SMOKES THE SHIT OUT OF SUPER AND HYPER CARS LIKE THIS OVERRATED TOYOTA AIN'T MADE BACK IN THE 90's. BUT YEAH STILL LACKS BODYKITS SO DON'T EXPECT IT TO LOOK LIKE HOW IT LOOKS IN NFS GAMES OR OTHER SIMILAR GAMES.",1

[h1] Forza Horizon 4[b]


üí°Overview[/b][/h1]

üî∏ [I]In Forza Horizon 4 [/i] ‚Äì It even makes our weather beautiful. As the season's change, the weather and the nature of the light change with the driving conditions. Edina's New Town shines in the faint sunshine of spring, and in winter the snow in the Highlands sucks all the light out of the sky. Ambleside cottages are beautiful in summer when the trees are very green and you can almost smell them. If you have a 4K TV, this is what it is made for. From time to time, like the first time I passed Edinburgh Castle in a completely yellowish blue on a summer night in Scotland, its beauty became quite emotional. [list]

[*]‚óºÔ∏è In [I]Game[/i] You unlock seasons by earning Influence, one of the two in-game currencies. The other is gear-centric Credits. The XP-like Influence is earned by entering races, finding cars, and successfully completing challenges. In fact, Influence, along with the new My Horizon Life campaigns and fresh customization features, causes the racer to lean into RPG elements more than ever before. 

[*]‚óºÔ∏è You now progress through the game by exploring more than 25 My Horizon Life story threads. Each of these represents a different way to spend time in the game world, including Road Racing, Drifting, and Stunt Driving. Everything you do in these career campaigns earns Influence, be it nailing stunts, taking photos, or creating sharable car decals or Blueprint race challenges. Even better, you aren't locked into a My Horizon Life campaign; you can jump to a different one at any time. [/list]

[h1][b]In the depth[/b][/h1]

üî∏ This is a game about the driving experience rather than the mechanics, and Forza Horizon 4 welcomes tourists as well as the gears. You can wash through low-rise walls and shrubs without scratching your paint, ride in a Ferrari in the rain, or take an Alfa Romeo up the mountain with just a little difficulty. Although you can go under the hood and tricks with any conceivable aspect of a favorite ride, share tuning settings and create and load custom levers, it's great to pick the car you like and head out into the countryside. Go to town to see what you like can work with it

‚óºÔ∏è [I][/i] Your character is also seen when you interact with NPCs or venture into a house. In Forza Horizon 4, you can buy houses‚Äîhubs that act as your avatar's base of operations. They each grant different bonuses, such as cars, fast travel options, and character customization gear. Houses don't come cheap, starting at roughly 200,000 Credits and venturing into the millions.


[h1][b]üïπÔ∏è Gameplay [/b][/h1]
üî∏ [I]  Forza Horizon 4  [/i]is as much an offline game as an online one, but, thankfully, PlayGround Games doesn't force you into matches with strangers. Like Forza Horizon 3, this game uses Drivatars, AI-based competitors that are based on the driving data of the people in your Xbox Friends List, to populate your game world when playing solo.
Your Drivatar does the same when it enters your friends' game worlds. You can also team up with Drivatars by rolling up to one, honking your horn, and forming a Convoy. With the right Skill perks, the cars in your Convoy can help you accumulate Influence at a faster rate or discover Barn Finds.[list][/list]

‚óºÔ∏è Barn Finds are rare cars that you find in barns scattered through the landscape. Some barns are easy to spot, while others require 1 exploration. Several Barn Finds are only available in certain seasons, so you're encouraged to revisit landscapes as the temperatures change. 


‚óºÔ∏è Included are many graphics options, including Dynamic Render Quality, Motion Blur, and VSync. There's even a mode for people who suffer from colorblindness. The game supports 4K resolution.

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2420239254

[h1][b]üîçForzathonlive [/b][/h1]
üî∏ On the upside, you can earn credits in #ForzathonLive that let you purchase exclusive vanity items and emotes from the Forzathon Shop. If you aren't in the mood for #FozathonLive happenings, you can challenge others to standard multiplayer matches or participate in co-op missions.

262,It's a lot of fun but I'm giving a negative review for being forced to watch DLC adverts in a PAID game :/,0
263,"I really want to love this game but it just falls short in so many areas.

The AI sucks;
 It's way too aggressive around players and will leave a good line just to ram you if you're nearby while ignoring other AI, Single player often feels like a 1vs11 team mode and is incredibly frustrating to play against.
It is too reliant on cheating and isn't actually fast. (Will bend the games physics to keep up with the player, ie more grip than or acceleration than possible for the player at the given rating), once you're past the AI they struggle to keep up with players in the corners even on the hardest difficulty, and are incapable of passing each other or the player without ramming.

Online is highly unfun;
Players are taught by the AI to race dirty because it's the only way to beat them. This mentality transfers into multiplayer. Players are often highly toxic and will turn races into demolition derbys. Players online often gravitate towards meta vehicles, which while it is to be expected for online racing, its very disappointing in a game that revolves so much around customizing, tuning, and decorating your own vehicles. 

That is if you can even get into a match, disconnects and crashes are ubiquitous. I struggle to think of a game in recent memory more unstable that this steam port of Forza Horizon 4. I have encountered more crashes than in cyberpunk 2077, star citizen, and Fallout New Vegas COMBINED. The state of this version of the game is frankly unacceptable for a 2018 AAA title. It's not that I have a weak rig either. I've been running this game on a  i7-9700k, 2080 super, with 48 gb of ram on an SSD.


If you can get through the crashes, disconnects, crappy ai even on unbeatable, and bumper cars multiplayer, you'll find a decent arcade racer with excellent car variety and customizability.

If you really want this game, Wait for it to go on sale.",0

[b]I want to talk about the talent of this dev team, they made an astonishing achievement in the game industry, the graphics are beautiful, the gameplay is smooth, cars are as realistic as possible, the map is huge and both graphic and sound effects are perfect, but one of the most important things apart of the gameplay, is the good optimization this game has, it runs with no frame drops, no stuttering, no high temps, basically a dream come 1. It also has an awesome picture mode to have fun with.[/b]

Let‚Äôs talk about what is inside the garage? A large selection of the best and most iconic car constructors, it‚Äôs a really big collection of both retro and modern cars, including even more cars with the dlc‚Äôs, I really don‚Äôt support dlc‚Äôs nowadays but in this case i see them as expansion packs for a complete game (we miss those right?). Collect them all, you can buy and sell cars in the ingame market, or you can try your luck with the ingame currency with the roulette, get cars and goodies for your avatar!.

[code]This game feels like when you take your hand off the window to feel the aerodynamics.[/code]

Another cool thing about this game is the season and weather system, changing seasons through the weeks and how they affect the map and the races, with their own community events, with exclusive rewards and goodies, makes the game super dynamic and it works perfect to me, you can still race with custom conditions. The player base is still healthy, the community is great, racing and completing community events is super fun.

The gameplay of Forza Horizon 4 is on point, you will enjoy it from the first ride, the speed sensation and the physics of the game are at another level. It will suit any type of user, you can play with a wheel, joystick or keyboard, in any case the gameplay will feel fun and enjoyable.
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2419923219 

The price changed in my store from 650 Ars to 3999 Ars, so i can‚Äôt tell if you should buy it right now on steam, this is a fair price? If you have the money, and you can afford it, I don't know the game is perfect as I said before. But i would never pay that much for a game because we also pay 65% of taxes and the price rises exponentially. And if you are from Europe or America, and you can‚Äôt still pay for it, we all can find this beautiful jem on the Xbox Gamepass for a really low price, we all won in any way.

270,"What we witness here is Microsoft shooting their own knee again, in their already legendary incompetence.

So, lets sum up the things we can only get on the Steam version:

-no impulse triggers support (PROBABLY THE MOST IMPORTANT FUNCTION IN THIS GAME)
-huge performance issues
-compatibility problems with wheels
-0 communication with the clients that payed for your product
-2.5 years old game
-no discount, no special offer, not even support
-high chance to not even be able to launch the game

YOU CAN GET ALL OF THIS WITH JUST 100 EUROS!!!

I don't want to be salty, but I can't support something like this. I know I'll get roasted from a lot of people, but I don't think I am wrong. We should not support this kind of services, this port is an embarasment and nobody even want to talk with us, the people that payed for it... How is it even possible to get such an inferior version? 

Game is great, but If you want to buy it, buy it from Microsoft, where it costs much less than here and has all features... I will not, can't support such incompetence and greed.",0

[h1] The best racing series on PC [/h1]
Let's start with the fact that I met Horizon a long time ago. Stumbled upon some random video abbout Horizon 2 ... It was amazing! For some reason I remembered the drops on the windshield, they were very realistic. Open world, festive atmosphere, a lot of different cars and much more. It was my dream. But there was one problem - it was not released on the PC.

And here's a miracle - the release of FH3 on PC. But again, something went wrong: I'm a 15-year-old guy and my PC with a Pentium g840 and gt440 on board. And at the same time the game cost $50.

It's been 2 years. I have more or less normal PC, but not $50 per game. And soon release of FH4.

And here it is - 3 years after its release, it appears on Steam, and even at the regional price tag. And I'm not 17. This is a victory! After 5 years of dreams, I can finally drift on a rear-wheel drive Evo 9 or go on a snowy road on Zenvo

[H1] Pros [/h1]
- Huge open colorful world
- Change of seasons
- The largest fleet of licensed cars in one game at the moment
- A variety of races and tasks
- Beautiful graphics
- Cool physical model
- Ability to customize the car to the smallest detail
- Cool variety of online modes (from simple drivin on the map, to the battle royal)
- And many other diverse content

[H1] Cons [/h1]
- Are they there?

[H1] Conclusion [/h1]
Do you like cars? Do you value diversity? Do you like flexibility? You like continuously adjust your car to the ideal?

If you answered ""yes"" to at least one question - you will be delighted with this game.

274,"EDIT- Gotta add a huge disclaimer here: the game does NOT work on recent Nvidia drivers and will crash frequently, which is really shitty. I'm forced to play Forza Horizon 5 unless I roll back my drivers, which I don't wanna do since a lot of games need newer drivers. They need to fix this ASAP, the game's been unplayable for me for months. Was tempted to change this to a negative review.

Very chill open world racing game and I love painting weeb cars. What more can I say :P

Coming to this game from Forza Horizon 5, this seems like a more polished game overall. The changing seasons are a very nice touch and I like that they actually change the gameplay too so you can cross frozen lakes in winter for instance. The map is more interesting and varied also, and it has small details like beauty spots that are absent from 5. Plus there are collaboration events and simply much more content in this game at the moment. I also like the soundtrack better.

As some downsides the quality of custom car decals (or rather vinyl shapes) is lower in this game compared to 5, most downloaded decals end up looking blurrier. And for some reason the game loses all audio ingame unless I disable all microphones in windows...which is a strange bug, because I even disabled voice chat ingame and it had no effect.

Other than that I haven't had issues with it. Would recommend on sale over Horizon 5, at least until it gets some sizeable expansions. Depends if you like Mexico better than the UK too (personally, with seasons, the UK is more interesting for me).",1

Its a Game breaker and IDK and IDC if its steams or Microsofts fault but steering a car with a wheel is an verry important part of a racing game!",0
281,fix lag and game crash it's would be 10/10,1
282,"Even though I have roughly 400hrs in FH4 across Microsoft and Steam platform and enjoyed it initially - I cannot recommend it anymore.

Crashes...
If you are planning to play on Steam Deck, be prepared for constant crashes. Game SHOULDN'T be marked as playable!
Once you will have flawless session, another 5+ times random crashes.
You may do nothing, sit in the auction house, race in the trial or do forzathon live - it will crash.

Encore?
Planning to do 100% achievements - not possible anymore (legit way), because they broke math behind weekly tasks (they don't add up to 100% completion, only 94%). Developer officially stated they will not fix it.

Cars...
If you are planning to join FH4 adventure - it's too late for you. If you want to risk it anyway, be prepared it's so much harder to obtain all the cars. Wheelspins are nerfed; some cars does not appear on the auctions at all or cost 20M. Not possible anymore to obtain PO (pre-order) cars like in the past through Auction House (developer decided to block them)

Save file...
Did you play previously on other platform than Steam? Yeah - you have to start from the beginning now.
Your unused backstage passes and not-redeemed gifts from previous platform should be available, but your progress and previously obtained cars are gone on Steam. Developer said that cross-save does not work, but in my opinion they are just lazy (and obviously don't see the value in doing this). Progress and what cars you have are kept locally on your computer + cloud for a backup (and sync between PC/Xbox), so the argument that Microsoft cloud cannot work with steam cloud is invalid. They could create mechanism that ""converts"" local files between folder that belongs to Microsoft version and Steam version. By ""converts"" I mean rename to correct filenames and move to correct folder. That's it! How do I know that? same thing WORKS in FH5!

Support...
Got problem with the game? Ticket closed.

Liveries...
Would you like to personalise your car by creating liveries? Be aware this is the easiest way to get ban in the game! Not worth it!

Overall now I'm more frustrated than pleased with the game :(",0

286,nfs killer,1
287,"FYI: You CAN'T bring existing saves over from the Microsoft Store Version.


I bought the steam copy of the game because the windows store version had some weird game breaking bug which would not allow me to connect to online, no matter how many tutorials I tried to follow, multiple clean installs even going as far as to remove registry related things and app data folders associated with the game, and the xbox app itself which ultimately never got solved.



To the steam version credit, the game starts instantly, seemingly ran smoother than the Microsoft Store and the Steam version has better controller support, also installed faster and had less start up related issues than the Microsoft Store like black screening for almost a minute or so, freezing just after the Microsoft Studio logo and other enjoyable start-up glitches which were seemingly not present in the Steam Version.



The only minor issue I had with the steam version was the initial login required you to click the xbox login screen otherwise it would freeze and act frozen and not look like it was capturing the text you were typing but it was, it just wasn't updating until you clicked it. After I learned what was happening I was able to login mostly fine aside from me forgetting my password the first login attempt.



The whole non-cross save thing killed it for me, I'm not about to re-buy a game, then try to get my account back to the status it was at after a year or more of progress on the other store front, so much has been done on it and cars were tastefully tuned after countless hours of tuning.



I went from 200 or so cars in my garage, and 10m cash in reserve to 1 car and a like 30k, all because of Microsoft's incompetency with their store and gaming service(s), I suppose old habits die hard.



Insult to injury I no longer have cars that you can't get any longer or acquire unless you were there for specific times and events which haven't been around for a year or more and are no longer accessible.

For those unseasoned, to try to buy said vehicles using in game mechanics and starting from scratch would require you to spend a few hundred hours grinding in game cash because of the way they ""re-balanced"" the economy and as a result it caused cars that were otherwise cheap vehicles prior to this patch are now have insanely unrealistic price values that are almost impossible to get enough cash for without somehow cheating, or saving all of your career earnings since the start of your account which will never happen in a reasonable amount of time.",0

Forza Horizon 4


üí°Overview

üî∏ In Forza Horizon 4 ‚Äì It even makes our weather beautiful. As the season's change, the weather and the nature of the light change with the driving conditions. Edina's New Town shines in the faint sunshine of spring, and in winter the snow in the Highlands sucks all the light out of the sky. Ambleside cottages are beautiful in summer when the trees are very green and you can almost smell them. If you have a 4K TV, this is what it is made for. From time to time, like the first time I passed Edinburgh Castle in a completely yellowish blue on a summer night in Scotland, its beauty became quite emotional.
‚óºÔ∏è In Game You unlock seasons by earning Influence, one of the two in-game currencies. The other is gear-centric Credits. The XP-like Influence is earned by entering races, finding cars, and successfully completing challenges. In fact, Influence, along with the new My Horizon Life campaigns and fresh customization features, causes the racer to lean into RPG elements more than ever before.

‚óºÔ∏è You now progress through the game by exploring more than 25 My Horizon Life story threads. Each of these represents a different way to spend time in the game world, including Road Racing, Drifting, and Stunt Driving. Everything you do in these career campaigns earns Influence, be it nailing stunts, taking photos, or creating sharable car decals or Blueprint race challenges. Even better, you aren't locked into a My Horizon Life campaign; you can jump to a different one at any time.

In the depth

üî∏ This is a game about the driving experience rather than the mechanics, and Forza Horizon 4 welcomes tourists as well as the gears. You can wash through low-rise walls and shrubs without scratching your paint, ride in a Ferrari in the rain, or take an Alfa Romeo up the mountain with just a little difficulty. Although you can go under the hood and tricks with any conceivable aspect of a favorite ride, share tuning settings and create and load custom levers, it's great to pick the car you like and head out into the countryside. Go to town to see what you like can work with it

‚óºÔ∏è Your character is also seen when you interact with NPCs or venture into a house. In Forza Horizon 4, you can buy houses‚Äîhubs that act as your avatar's base of operations. They each grant different bonuses, such as cars, fast travel options, and character customization gear. Houses don't come cheap, starting at roughly 200,000 Credits and venturing into the millions.


üïπÔ∏è Gameplay
üî∏ Forza Horizon 4 is as much an offline game as an online one, but, thankfully, PlayGround Games doesn't force you into matches with strangers. Like Forza Horizon 3, this game uses Drivatars, AI-based competitors that are based on the driving data of the people in your Xbox Friends List, to populate your game world when playing solo.
Your Drivatar does the same when it enters your friends' game worlds. You can also team up with Drivatars by rolling up to one, honking your horn, and forming a Convoy. With the right Skill perks, the cars in your Convoy can help you accumulate Influence at a faster rate or discover Barn Finds.

‚óºÔ∏è Barn Finds are rare cars that you find in barns scattered through the landscape. Some barns are easy to spot, while others require 1 exploration. Several Barn Finds are only available in certain seasons, so you're encouraged to revisit landscapes as the temperatures change.


‚óºÔ∏è Included are many graphics options, including Dynamic Render Quality, Motion Blur, and VSync. There's even a mode for people who suffer from colorblindness. The game supports 4K Resolution 


üîçForzathonlive
üî∏ On the upside, you can earn credits in #ForzathonLive that let you purchase exclusive vanity items and emotes from the Forzathon Shop. If you aren't in the mood for #FozathonLive happenings, you can challenge others to standard multiplayer matches or participate in co-op missions.

‚ò£Ô∏èThe best racing game I've ever seen‚ò¢Ô∏è


üü© Pros

+Online functionality creates the impression of a dynamic world
+Stunning amount of detail and visual variety
+ Freedom to progress through the game as you desire.
+ Changing seasons alter how you approach races
+ A ridiculous number of cars.
+ Features over 450 licensed cars
+ Solid handling as ever with a huge number of vehicles to unlock



üü• Cons

- Tedious #ForzathonLive online contests.
- Lacks a custom music station.
-It takes a while, though repetition eventually sets in
-Road textures would occasionally vanish during testing.",1

One of the best #Racing, #Driving, #Open World games of all time. Let's drop the chit-chat and get to the point.

    [*]Best realistic graphic.
    [*]Best Engine's sounds (like you really have a Bugatti Chiron).
    [*]Best Dynamic seasons for a racing game.

[list]
    [*] Some say that we shouldn't pay $60 for a three year old game ( the standard version is $60)
    [*] you should waited THREE years for the steam release -_-

I'm done with my part, now it's your turn. All you have to do is buy the game, and enjoy it.
For those who may concern, the game download 77.93 gigabytes, and it takes 80 GB.
it's better to have 100 GB free storage ( you can find this invaluable information on SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS section (really!? -_-) )

304,"[h1] Something here for everyone ! [/h1]

Whether you are a hardcore car simulator fanatic who wants to experience a wide plethora of cars using a racing wheel and pedals or simply a casual gamer who wants to have fun, Forza Horizon 4 has got it all !

[b] GAMEPLAY [/b]
The game is well designed by Microsoft to suit both hardcore car simulation enthusiasts and people who prefer an easygoing handling. The game has various types of races and events to suit all tastes, from drifting gloriously in the mud in cross country/off-road events to the ever popular blazing fast sprint races, Forza 4 will keep you occupied for hours as you move from season to season, exploring the beautiful Scottish settings. From wide open spaces to dark and foreboding moors in the night to the beautifully designed city of Edinburgh and quaint little villages again there is something to suit everyone's tastes. The showcase events are cinematically designed to make you go ""wow"" with a wide range of challenges and if you ever get bored of the AI drivatars, there is always an option to challenge a player over a head to head in multiplayer or bundle alongside them in a convoy !


[b] GRAPHICS [/b]
One word, Gorgeous ! 
If you have got a PC which can at least run it on medium-high settings, you wont regret buying the game as you are treated to a graphical masterpiece. Each season in the game is beautifully designed which special emphasis on what effect the season has on car handling (don't expect your Bugatti Chiron to handle well in a snow covered field XD). The environment is incredibly destructive as well as you smash through various stone fences and boundaries. The superb lighting of the game ensures that every car looks extremely real and the effects and decals (mud splatters and scratches) are brilliantly rendered as well. All in all a powerhouse when it comes to graphics.

[b] BOTTOM LINE [/b]
I know many people would be waiting for the game to go on a discount to grab it but trust me, youd be missing out a lot. It is a steal at the price at which it is launched, i went for the standard version as you anyway get a huge load of cars about a couple of hours into the game. If you have got the dough and are into racing games, do not wait for a discount, youll be getting hours of content and multiplayer fun if you get it.

[b]Solid 07 out of 10 Score From My Personal Experience![/b]

[b]Forza Horizon[/b] franchise has always been praised for its amazing graphical details to cars, decent car handling & overall a joyful experience. If you're someone, playing first time.. gonna have a blast, playing this game. I ain't no exception but deep down I feel a lack of variation & a potential lost when it comes to car collection & objective structure. First of all, you won't even need that many cars to complete races.. then yet you'll be rewarded cars, here & there.. giving u a lost feeling! What I'm supposed to do with that many cars! The races themselves are pretty blunt, except those showcase races. Car handling overall does the job but feels like could've been better.

It's pretty useless to not recommend a game of this caliber (I myself, already purchased it twice on different occasions) at this point. So yeah, I didn't feel motivated enough to keep the engine running at full gear to complete everything in the game. I feel, It has some boring factor built-in, the way the game was designed. But leaving it up to u guys!",1
306,"Game is almost awesome. The things I dislike about it greatly are the random unskippable briefs and the in-game ads about expansions.

Why can't Microsoft make stable games for their own OS is beyond my understanding. I looked up on the internet and found that other people have this issue too. They suggest tens of different fixes but i don't bother doing them since i paid this finished game to play and enjoy, not to install Microsoft Visual something something, do a clean boot bla bla bla. 
Despite it's technical issues, I loved driving around in this game, and there's also lots of different races. I'll maybe still play this game time to time, but idk if I'll keep continuing bearing these random freezes.",0
310,"the steam version stutters like shit, i do have a capable hardware, in fact i have the windows version that runs smooth like butter, loading times are longer, and my logitech g29 doesnt work properly, no ffb (picture the crew 2)
bad news for returning players, it has crossplay but no cross save, u start from scratch... (facepalm)

the game itself is good, its not a simulator for those wondering, its a sim/ arcade, more on the sim side. the game is beautiful and fun, it will feel repetitive and boring eventually but you will sure have lots of fun, story sucks, game play is nice, scenery is a treat, and free roaming is the best aspect about this game.

i dont recommend for returning players, unless you want to replay a 3 years old game from scratch, i personally bought it cuz i dont want to pay for xbox gamepass anymore, and the steam version came cheaper.
i recommend waiting for sale, and for those performance issues to get fixed",0
311,"How can i discribe this game......well first of all its an open world racing game which by far its one of the most amazing and gorgeous racing game i've ever played in my life..... not to mention it has great atmosphere,beautiful views and most of all Amazing Soundtracks..

this game defently beats Test Drive Unlimited by any means and yeah tdu didnt have an actual drum n bass radio station like Hospital Records which i cant stop listin to it while playing this game...
 
the first time i tried that game is when i had xbox game pass for the first time and then that moment when you feel like you fall in love with a game has happend....

This game defenetly worth the money if you like to experience beauty at its finest and also if you are a car enthusiast that like to race for fun.

Such a beautiful game it makes me cry just from writing that review and i mean it...

314,Amazing game but it crashes every 10 mins and the devs refuse to fix it,0
315,It crashes everytime i open it.,0
316,Crashes all the time! just bull. fix your game. every time im with friends it crashes. anyone else have this craptasitc experience,0
317,"Yes, I definitely love this game, it is an attraction of emotions, I just cannot believe that I was able to play such a wonderful game.

+

1. Very cool gameplay, landscapes, a huge number of cars and excellent graphics.

2. I really liked this game, especially when I play it with a friend, it was magical and wonderful. A bunch of joint photos, online in this game is the best.

3. Cool and thoughtful tuning of cars. The car can be adjusted to anything and how you want, beautiful coloring made by players and the ability to make your own.

4. There are really a lot of cars ... I didn't know that some even exist, but thanks to this game, I began to understand and be interested in cars.

5. Landscape of a British town. I would not say that it is directly the best, but probably one of the best, the beautiful Westfield Bridge, calm, small villages and a big bustling city, it‚Äôs a great feeling that you can be wherever you want.

-

1. Sounds of cars are not beautiful, the same and do not give any kind of pleasure hearing them.

2. The bots in this game are actually stupid, and they do everything too correctly, it is annoying when the bots cannot be pushed off the track, and they drive too correctly, without any mistakes, I hope that everything will be different in Forza Horizon 5, but it is hard to believe in it.


Conclusion: In general, I liked the game, it gave me those emotions that I lacked from games, and it still brings some pleasure playing it, now I'm really looking forward to Forza Horizon 5, because I already want to see what kind of there will be a car park. It is a pity that the current Forza did not have a Rolls Royce, and newer modifications of cars.

323,love this game but the steam  version has some serious issues!  Windows store version  plays alright but steam version can't carry save file from the windows 10 store version to steam. You have to start completely over and even tho you still use your same xbox login account it still has separate saves between two version.   (i read online the way they store the information for game saves very too much to have cross save  from windows to steam) #2 issue other major thing wrong with the steam version in game over lay ui when turned on the gpu only  up to 36% usage and  down to like 17% usage  with a 11gb 1080ti runing 2k ultra settings which i can play 90 percent of my games at 80 fps to 144 in 2k and in windows task manager my 3950x is using 2% to 10% cpu usage and gpu is at 2% usage. It has game breaking stutter and pauses  that will have you constantly spinning out or running off track or trail when game unfreezes after  1 to 3 seconds and you over steer around corner then game catches  up and your in the ditch its unplayable in this state as of 4/19/21 i can not recommend this game is very upsetting cause i know this game is so much better than this but they need to  fix the freezing issue and wish they could come up with a workaround for the save files systems.,0
324,"open world game with over 450 cars that you can upgrade and customize your cars 
every weeks seasons changing to next one (new races , new events and many more)
online functionality creates the impression of a dynamic world...
you can also teaming up with your friends as a convoy and doing variety of stuff

cant wait for the forza horizon 5.. undoubtedly it has higher amount of cars and new features.

326,"I have played that game using an XBox Game Pass account about 6 months ago and it was working just fine with my sim racing hardware. Microsoft is screwing Steam Valve users over by supplying a different version of the game to Steam customers that is broken when you use a wheel/pedals/handbrake setup that uses multiple USB devices. 

The problem is specific to the Steam edition and Microsoft will not bother themselves with the idea of fixing the problem.
https://www.reddit.com/r/ForzaHorizon/comments/ocoo2x/binding_of_multiple_usb_devices_to_steam_edition/

I love playing car racing games since my first PC game was a car racing game, Actually I never played any game of the forza franchise before I play FH4, but indeed it is a good franchise. So if I say in my experience, FH4 is a magnificent racing game which its world set in beautiful great Britain. Its graphics looks so incredible when riding around its breathtaking environment. FH4 has so much cars to ride and few visual customizations but not as much bodywork customizations as NFS games. However it offers players great racing experience, so much races to play and other activities to do around its world. In online, It is very fun playing with friends, go races with them and explore around the world with them :)
And the other thing that must be said about the game is that its season changing system is great which changing the seasons automatically by the game. As for the cons I could only say that the game is keep crashing sometimes when joining to friends via xbox which is really annoying when playing with friends.

330,"The ultimate driving experience.

I remember playing Gran Turismo 2 on the Playstation. It was a wonderful experience allowing you to fully customize car specs, earn new vehicles, and participate in various styles of racing. Forza Horizon 4 takes the legacy expectations of Gran Turismo, removes the tedious parts of the game (like licenses) and gives you almost unlimited access to race anything however you want it. What's better: anytime you play against the AI, the game closely matches your cars performance so you're technical skill is tested as much as your vehicles performance. Daylight, weather, and weekly rotating seasons continuously change the map, making every drive feel fresh. Weekly challenges, an auction house, and a fantastic radio add a great level of immersion to the experience. What's the bad? You'll want to own many of these cars in real life.

Time to complete: 100+ hours and counting!",1
331,I've spent 100 hours on the loading screen. I always wait for the song to finish before I start the game.,1
332,Funny car go brrrrrrrr haha,1
333,"First 10 hours playing my first Forza Horizon Series game over the past three days. I've had so much fun playing it! This game is really fun and entertaining where the game has lots of content, cars, great soundtracks, beautiful open world, and amazing gameplay and mechanics. A great game for casual gamers and avid racing gamers to play and have fun in Forza Horizon world ^_^. It's recommended to buy the Ultimate Edition on sales because tons of additional content and bonuses that you'll receive after installing the game. Better late than never to play FH4 although there is FH5 already been launched last year.",1
334,"I played this for over 100 hours on Xbox and this is legitimately one of my favorite racing games ever. I'm so happy to see it appear on Steam. This is pretty much my go-to game whenever I just wanna relax and have fun

Positives:
- Really solid driving model
- Beautiful Graphics
- Amazing Soundtrack
- Massive Car List
- Lots of stuff to do (Especially now with the user made levels)
- Really good car customization
- You can level up and progress through the main story just by doing pretty much whatever you want, giving you a ton of freedom

Negatives:
- (STEAM ONLY) Some strange performance issues & glitches which weren't in the MS store version. It's not unplayable but it is still really strange
- (STEAM ONLY) No save transfer to or from Xbox or MS Store, which sucks for a lot of returning players but I didn't mind too much
- REALLY dumb AI, they are pretty easy even on the harder difficulties, and at times they feel inconsistent too
- Kinda buggy (On all platforms) I've had lots of times where I've fallen through the map, or have had parts of the map not even load and those bugs don't seem to be much better on Steam

I totally recommend this to new players, although I'd wait for a sale since it's a bit expensive as of launch.

For returning players it's kinda hard to recommend since you can't transfer your stuff over unless you don't mind starting over like me",1

While the amalgamated UK may be a little too pristine, not completely reflecting reality, it's such a stunning and enjoyable place to race around that any issues are washed away in the utter fun you're having. Forza Horizon 4 is, without a shadow of a doubt, the pinnacle of the series and arguably the best racing game you can buy.",1

347,"Best cars game, now available on Steam <3 Already tested and approved on Microsoft Store . i just need it on my Steam account",1
348,"Forza Horizon 4 is by far one of the most polished and entertaining racing games to date and my absolute personal favorite.

Horizon 4 is a gorgeous open world game which takes place in Great Britain with locations like Ambleside, Broadway and the main star of the show ‚Äì Scotland‚Äôs capital ‚Äì Edinburgh. It is the first game in the series with not only dynamic weather and day/night cycles but now all 4 seasons of the year. Seasons cycle weekly and drastically change the way the entire game looks and plays out.

Driving in Horizon 4 is a near perfect balance between arcade and simulation. Physics feel realistic and on point all throughout the game no matter what type of content you're doing. The amount of things to do in this game is mind boggling. Horizon 4 has one of the biggest car lists out there with more than 700 vehicles total as of 2021. There are 2 great DLC expansions that add even more content to an already massive base game. The Fortune Island is, in my opinion, the greatest DLC of any racing game ever.

Mind you, Horizon 4 has a couple of flaws. Some of the engine sounds are just plain inaccurate. While performance tuning is plentiful I would have loved to see more visual customization - Need for Speed Heat and The Crew 2 are miles ahead in this department. Although Forza is one of the few games that managed to solve the problems of wall riding and ramming in online play making it far more enjoyable and competitive the stability of online servers is questionable.

From performance point of view the game is really well optimized with requirements even lower than the last game in the series. Game does occasionally suffer from pop-in regardless of how good your setup might be, though nothing game breaking.

This review comes from my 400+ hours of experience on Microsoft Store. I bought a second copy of the ultimate edition on steam without hesitating for a second.",1
349,Great game that I put a lot of hours into on the microsoft store. I refunded the steam version as I cannot sync my account with every car in the game and hundreds of hours of progress.,1

357,My opinion may change on this in the future when the issues are fixed. Keeping that in consideration the game is really fun. However the steam release was a very half-assed job on their behalf. There are a lot of bugs that need to be fixed including the game not detecting my TH8A shifter and handbrake even though they're on the compatible product page. Once the bugs are fixed I would definitely recommend the game but for now this is where I stand.,0

You can have anything from an old car you'd see racing to the newest most high-tech vehicles on the market.

367,"This game is good to pass time, BUT recently all it does is crash within 10-20 minutes. At least before it'd be hours before it'd decide to randomly crash. Guess I should have seen that considering Microsoft is extremely good at making things crash, freeze, BSOD, etc at completely random times. (Usually when you haven't saved something). So on the basis of it crashing, it's not recommended by me and it's unlikely Microsoft will pull their finger out their backsides to fix the issue. Shame, because it can be a fun game up to a point.",0
368,"The game is not launching at all - no error, nothing.

I almost never review a game based on it's technical issues, but for this title I'm willing to make an exception, because I feel these kind of problems should not be tolerated for a full-priced 2.5-year old game that's releasing on the same platform it's already been released on.

By now I've spent 6 hours updating windows, validating game files, changing security policies, tinkering with antivirus/firewall settings, creating new system users, and even radically changing windows installation properties.

Judging by Steam discussion board, this problem is reproducible across a number of systems without any acknowledgement from the game's developer/publisher. On top of that I'm expecting issues with my driving wheel, since people are reporting problems with it as well.

Windows error logs contain the least information possible, which is especially surreal considering this a Microsoft title.
So far this is the only game I've had over the years that completely refused to launch or even indicate what the issue may be.

The most ridiculous part that the game with the most significant issues on a Microsoft platform - is the one developed by a Microsoft game studio.

370,"Open world racing games are cool, but after a point what more can really add to the open world experience without stepping out of a car. Collectibles? Drift Rounds? Breaking Billboards? Mehhhh...
Forza Horizon 4 answers that in the most unexpected way.
This game makes even the most mundane task of travelling to every event or checkpoint so engaging that you will forget fast travel.
The driving is perfect balance of sim and arcade. You will be challenged but not rage quit on every turn of a track.

376,"The ultimate edition is one of the most expensive games on Steam. Even on sale I¬¥ve had to pay the price for an undiscounted AAA title. The game requires an Xbox account and the publisher isn¬¥t your favourite indie company in need of your money ;)

The game was released on Xbox some years ago and Forza 5 might be released on Xbox this year. So Steam users are asked a premium XXL price for something that¬¥s nearing the end of its life cycle. The port to PC is ok, but some players experience micro stutters in MP races. I¬¥ve had about one ctd per 20 gaming hours which isn¬¥t ok, but would be tolerable (if not for the premium price tag).

After all those cons, why do I recommend this game?

Because it¬¥s a BLAST!!!!

Most fun I¬¥ve ever had in an arcade racing game! A zillion cars to use and abuse, fluent transition from SP to MP and such a lot of things to do and experience, that you need hundrets of hours to play through. Difficulty can be adjusted in a lot of clever ways. The rewarding system is perfect and keeps your playing for more cars, houses or just avatar cosmetics.

From races on streets or through the woods, to stunt driving and playing tag there¬¥s no activity that¬¥s not implemented. There¬¥s even a battle royale in cars that¬¥ll entertain you for hours. The main advantage to buy a game that¬¥s been released years ago: all the additions that Xbox players had to wait for are already there. 2 extra maps (dlc that are included in the ultimate edition), nearly 500 (!) cars to chose from and a great variety of player-made car settings and cosmetics.

For achievement hunters: all achievs work and are doable. It took me around 200 hrs to get them all - without any grindy stuff and with a lot of fun.

So if any one if looking for a workaround I guess this is one though not a good one. The devs seem to have abandoned it as FH5 is just around the corner. So if anyone is waiting for a patch, stop waiting. I highly recommend this game now to any racing fan. And even if you don't like racing games, still give it a go. This is one of the most beautiful games ever.


When Forza Horizon 4 originally launched I had a dream of one day playing it. I never liked MS Store but still got the gamepass to play this game and when it was announced that the game was coming to steam I was beyond ecstatic.

Now after playing for 2 hours I am just sad. Its a piss poor port. The MS Store ran flawlessly for me but this one stutters like anything. The faster I go the worse it stutters and also encountered 2 random crashes to desktop without any error. Seeing the there was literally no communication from MS before the game launched on steam I don't have much hope of seeing patches for such a old game too.

For now I cannot recommend people to get this game on steam as the stutter is widespread. 4 of my friends are facing on a variety of configurations. Stay away from the steam copy for now.",1
398,I can't stop playing this game.,1
399,"[h1] Thoughts [/h1]

In my opinion, Horizon 4 is the best racing game of all time. 

I must admit that I became far more laid back recently and I really started playing Forza Motorsport since the 3rd installment. I really enjoyed how Forza always looked passionate about cars (though probably not as much about Motorsport, ironic as it may be... Grand Turismo is an awesome game that‚Äôs far more focused on the actual Motorsport, the 1st grand Turismo is the game that got me into racing games, I adore them all). Anyway, I remember playing FM4 and loving every second of it (especially the top gear/Jeremy Clarkson part) and all thinking that a street racing version of Forza would be my dream game... a game that I can play with a control but still feel thing‚Äôs like weight transfer.

Enough about the background, Horizon 4 is a stunning game with an incredible car selection and awesome racing. It even pays tribute to other famous racing games in a way that made me emotional (something I never thought a racing game could do). It plays with nostalgia but who cares?! It does it in a very respectful, almost adoring way that you can‚Äôt help but like. 

 If you are anything like me, you will love this game. It‚Äôs obvious not rFactor or even Grand Tourismo, so don‚Äôt expect that. But if you are looking for a fun street racing game that makes cars actually feel as realistic as they can feel with a controller, I think this is the best game ever.",1
400,"This game is amazing, why did I learn about it so late? The first game where I think I will pre-order the new part of FH5.",1
401,"Lets cut to the chase. If this game runs past 20 minutes by default is a miracle. I was forced to run old outdated nvidia drivers to get past the 20 minute crash (I measured it each time, will crash at the 20 mark) and it still crashes often but at random intervals now. But it gets even better, I tried it on my steam deck this morning (Dec 11, 22) and it will not recognize controller input both from native or bluetooth ones, and I decided to give it a try on the PC again and NOPE, Game will not even load the menu screen. I don't know what they did this last week but whatever it is, made the game unplayable. So... PLAYER BEWARE, spend your money somewhere else and avoid the long waste of money, time, frustrations and headaches to yourself. I have 25hrs on record of which probably only around 7 have been gameplay. the others have been me thinkering trying to find a solution. Good game but unplayable.",0
402,"Good god there is an annoying amount of talking in this game. Why is there so much talking? Just let me race the damn cars, stop interrupting that, or at the very least let me skip the dialogue",0
403,"Thrustmaster T300, Heusinkveld Ultimate pedals, TH8A Shifter. Steam version will not detect pedals or shifter, even with each USB plugged directly into the computer or powered USB hub. Can not recommend and refunding.

Update: The Microsoft demo version of Forza Horizon 4 detects all peripherals without any issues. This is clearly a Steam issue.",0

[h1]The gist of it:[/h1]
When I was a kid, I used to love racing games such as NFS Porsche or Underground, but as time went by I simply stopped playing them because either they felt bad or maybe because my tastes have changed. I decided to give Forza Horizon 4 a shot after playing its demo, and I'm glad I did because it's the perfect driving experience. 

üëç [u]The good parts:[/u]
+Car variation
+Sound design
+Atmosphere
+Driving mechanics

üëé[u]The bad parts:[/u]
-Although it depends on each person, it felt a bit bloated with way too many similar races
-Cringe dialogue

[h1]Story[/h1]
It's a racing game, so don't expect some kind of mind-blowing, emotional story here. You are a driver and you just joined the Forza Horizon Festival where racers from all over the world compete in hundreds of challenges. 

Besides the usual races, there are some story missions, if you can call them that, which spice things up quite a bit. For example, you can join a taxi service, become a stunt driver, and many more. These story bits can offer a bit more depth to the game or the car's history, but that's about it. 

That being said, the story challenges are quite nice, most of them anyway, and they did make the game more fun even if most of the characters you meet are cringe as hell but then again, aren't we all like that in real life? 
 
Story rating: 7/10

[h1]Gameplay[/h1]
Now onto the meat of the game, the gameplay, and oh boy, is there a lot of it for a racing game. There are several types of races in the game you can take part in, such as road racing which is your standard race. Then there's dirt racing which takes you on muddy roads where you'll most likely going to have specific cars meant for those kinds of roads. You also have cross-country races where you race all over the map, especially off-road and on the fields and just like the dirt ones, you will be forced to use specific types of cars. You can't just drive your Lamborghini through rocky fields. Finally, there are illegal races which are pretty much the same as any other road race but they take place at night while there is traffic on the roads. 

Forza Horizon 4 also has some uniquely awesome races though sadly only a few of them where you race against a train, a jet, and other surprises I'll let you discover. You'll also have other activities to do besides the races I mentioned and the story challenges, such as barn finds, where you can find some unique vehicles, online races and events, and much more. Another unique feature is the season's mechanic. Each week or two, the season automatically changes in the game which can also change how the cars perform. In winter, you're probably going to need to get the snow tires and generally play with dirt racing cars, or in rainy seasons such as autumn, it's probably best to stick with cars that have great handling. 

Accessibility is the perfect definition for Forza Horizon 4. It's not just a racing game, it's a driving experience, an incredible one at that. You can customize your gameplay however you want, from how the car handles itself, to how easy or hard you want the AI cars to be. You can turn Forza Horizon 4 from a casual experience to a hardcore racing game, it's all up to you. Now you may be wondering, but how do you race with a Lancia vs a Buggati? Well here's where Forza Horizon shines even more. Each of the hundreds of cars you have access to, have a rating system that is based on its type and features, which you can increase or decrease. The rating system will automatically put you up against cars or opponents from similar ratings. If your class is C you will never face against S type. And there is so much more I haven't even touched, such as customizing your driver, your car, and you can even purchase houses all over the map. Best to experience all the game has to offer for yourselves, it is bloated, no doubt, but most of it is great. 

I am in awe at how much love and care went into the game mechanics. It's not always perfect, but it's the best you can get. 

Gameplay rating: 9.5/10

[h1]Audio[/h1]
Let's start with the soundtrack, it's certainly something that will depend on each person's taste even if they tried to bring as many genres as possible into the radio channels. In my case, about half the songs are great towards awesome, so much that I still listen to them on youtube/spotify, and the other half were kinda meh. 

Voice acting is mostly cringe, as I mentioned before, but it's not that kind of forced cringe you see in most games, it feels like a natural cringe, something you'd probably hear in real life with your friends. Take that as you want. 

As for the sound effects, they are great and the cars sound amazing considering there are hundreds of them. Yes, some will of course sound similar, nothing is perfect, but overall they did an incredible job. 

Audio rating: 8/10

[h1]Graphics, performance and tech analysis[/h1]
The gameplay is great, but what about the atmosphere, and the map itself? Well, Forza Horizon 4 has a unique mechanic which I talked about briefly, the seasons. Every week or so, the season changes in the game. Visually and tech-wise, it's an incredible feat to have a huge open world map with not only time of day but seasons as well!? It's awesome and Britain looks wonderful, some of the places you race in, especially if you have the Fortune Island expansion, are breathtaking. 

But it's not just the atmosphere, but the cars themselves considering the amount you have access to, is insane, how detailed they are, from huge trucks to the smallest of cars. 

With so much content, so many features, and such a detailed world you are bound to run into problems such as bugs and crashes, but they are not as often or annoying as you might think. What's even more insane is how well the game runs. What a great engine. 

Graphics, performance and tech analysis score: 9.5/10

[h1]Conclusion[/h1]
Forza Horizon 4 is honestly the perfect racing game and the perfect driving game. It's a game for everyone, and it's a game you should play right now.

The handling feels great, there are tons of collectibles and side missions to look for, the soundtrack is great, and there are plenty of difficulty options to tailor the game to how you want to play.

414,"Forza Horizon 4, one of the most popular racing games of recent years, is now on Steam! It has excellent graphics, extremely good physics, and an enormous world that never dies.

420,"    Imagine being told that they ported this game from platform to platform even thought eh platform they ported it from was windows 10...

and non of the dlc cars because you claimed them on your original ms version of the game,and all that is shrugged off with the phrase ""due to technical difficulties""
     The game has cross platform play, but because the MS and XBOX versions are one patch ahead the game will crash as soon as you come across someone in your lobby who is playing on the MS or Xbox version...

I don't understand why this game has such a good score on steam even though the steam release is very unstable compared to the MS version, stutters constantly freezes and crashes.",0
421,"I've always been a die hard Need For Speed fan, and while the arcade street racing is in it's own thing, it could learn a lot from Forza Horizon's gameplay. FH 4, in particular, hits the nail in a couple of aspects:

- Gameplay wise, you can enjoy it with a steering wheel, a keyboard or a gamepad. Whatever suits you
- A fantastic roster of very distinct cars, each with it's own plus and cons
- Great tuning setup allows you to build monster cars, sleepers, all of it
- A long but enjoyable list of game modes, PVE and PVP, with different types of racing styles

FH 5 is a few months ahead of us. In any case, you're more than welcome to enjoy this solid entry of Forza.",1
422,"Okay first off, I don‚Äôt even know where to start. The game is phenomenal I‚Äôm so many aspects. First, the car supply is endless, granted I‚Äôve only had the game for a few days, but I‚Äôve probably played it for about 70-80 hours total so far. There is so much to do, they give you races, you can explore the auction house, unique and challenging barn finds, etc, the options truly are endless. I haven‚Äôt even scratched the multiplayer yet. I love the auction house concept and that‚Äôs a good way to earn extra credits and buy special cars I have never seen before. Next I think the horizon concept is great. The Forza Motorsport series is good, but horizon beats driving around a track.. with the endless options you can do in horizon. It actually has somewhat of a story line. The graphics in this game are insane (like I expected).
 The map is huge, there is so much to explore and each car can express itself in its own way from off-roading to drifting to just straight speed. the seasons are great because each car acts different in each season in a way, and forza nailed that. Lastly, if you‚Äôre teetering I‚Äôm getting this game or not, I would without question, it is 1000% WORTH IT for anyone in general but especially car fans. Recently announced Forza Horizon 5 and we will all go there, but still someday we will want to remember what it's like to drive in the left lane xD.",1

I have just started getting into online racing and, while it's a blast when I‚Äôm playing, that is less than half of the time. Load times are abysmal and take much longer than the actual races. Despite this, I‚Äôve had a lot of fun with the game and have already sunk around 40 hours into it at the time of writing this review. The driving is solid and the car customization is super fun.

The menus are terrible and it‚Äôs an absolute pain to find simple things that should probably just be on the first page instead of hidden away in submenus. One time I spent 5 around minutes just trying to find the audio settings. The menus are cluttered with useless junk and the DLC takes up three whole pages. That being said the Fortune Island DLC is absolutely amazing and contains my favorite rally tracks. I can‚Äôt speak for the car passes and the Lego DLC though because I haven‚Äôt purchased them. Secondly, barn finds are just annoying. They make you go off to some random place on the map and have you drive around for 10 minutes trying to find a hidden shed with a cool car inside. I much prefer the way Fortune Island did its treasure hunt thing. It felt like an adventure and not mindlessly wandering in a field. The barn finds are not a puzzle and they don‚Äôt encourage you to explore anything other than some random, boring ass feild. Thirdly, while I love the seasonal mechanic and it keeps you coming back every week, winter is just annoying. I understand that it should be slippery, but it just isn‚Äôt as fun as any of the other seasons. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I still enjoy the game in winter, just nowhere near as much. Forza Horizon 4 is a great game with a few game breaking, and not so game breaking issues. If you are able to look past them, then it‚Äôs a great time, but you should still probably just get the version from the Microsoft store, but I do believe that the bug will eventually be patched on Steam, and modders might even be able to break the encryption and allow for even more customization. While I recommend the game wholeheartedly. I do not recommend this version.",0

446,"Forza Horizion 4 is by and large really good the driving physics took a bit of getting used to at the beginning but after a while it was surprisingly fun to drive even then many cars feel different from the other:

Pros:
+ over 700 cars (if you have ultimate) 500 cars if you have the normal version
+ there are a lot of car brands at the start, including rather unknown brands, which I also find very good
+ great open world looks good and plays well
+ 3 different types of event races there are street races, dirt so rally-like stuff would rather say rallycoross and cross-field a cross country with pickups mostly
+ every 4 seasons (spring, summer, autumn and winter) are changed every week, which is really nice
+ the horizion stories are okay, mostly it‚Äôs going from A to B, there‚Äôs also jumping as far as you can or drifting to get points, but things like that are okay anyway
+ you can create your own challenges it sounds better than it but it really is but it is still ok
+ the route editor is really good and has to be there again for the 5th part because you can put together a lot more routes for more variety the bots are even reasonably good
+ the eleminator game mode is fine for a short while until you get to the highest level, then you don't need to play it anymore
+ wheelspins are okay because you often get money or cars, which is really nice
+ most of the soundtracks are ok I would say I was only on 2 stations, the others weren't interested in me (Horizion Pulse,)
+ tuning of the cars is okay, especially if some of them have nice parts to choose from
+ every event can be played with almost every car which is nice there are hardly any restrictions
+ every week a new festival season is changed with new rewards like cars that is also the point of getting rarer cars

Cons:
- It is sometimes difficult to get beautiful cars that are not available in the dealership, which then usually cost a lot in the auction with other players
- the auction does not sometimes work as it should, it usually does not update the current price of the car quickly
- too many Farraris, Lambos and Mustangs there could have been much better cars

Sometimes this game reminds me a little bit of the old Gran Turismo 2-4 games because i really dont know why but some cars from this games are here which is really really nice. To the point here i have all the cars in my garage which was tough and not so easy but still the game is good!",1

452,"Forza Horizon 4 is one of the most polished driving games ever made. The feeling, the amount of content, the spectacular open world and the unbelievable visuals are some pieces of this puzzle that match perfectly to form, all together, a 1 masterpiece that is perfect in almost every single aspect.
",1
453,"Easily the best arcade racing game up to this date, with a beautiful open world that changes by each season and a huge amount of content. It can be enjoyed alone or online with other players. Online can be unlocked only after completing a series of races that serve as tutorial. There are many customization options for both your car and your sim, including clothes and emotes. No microtransactions, you can unlock all the stuff simply by racing, exploring and levelling up. There are some cars DLCs and a VIP membership that double your rewards and give you some exclusive stuff but honestly there is so much content in the base game that you won't feel the need to buy those. The rewards are pretty generous, with the wheel of fortune you can get rare items and super cars from the very beginning.

Now the Steam version is unpolished. There is still some random stuttering and no support for impulse triggers on Xbox controllers, but hopefully these will be fixed soon. The biggest problem is the lack of cross-save between Steam and Xbox/Game Pass, which is awkward considering the game requires an Xbox Live account. It's something that Microsoft should immediately fix for all their games available on Steam. In any case the game is massively overpriced. I would only recommend it at a 50% discount or more and only if you're planning to get some DLCs too. If you want to play just the base game then Xbox Game Pass is a much convenient option, at least until Forza Horizon 5 comes out.",1
454,This game keeps crashing.,1
455,"No!

No? Why do I say no you ask? Well, the answer to that question my friends is very simple, ask yourself this. Do I like not being able to launch a game which is something like 3 years old at the price of $80?

If you like spending $80 and not being able to launch the game at all then Forza Horizon 4 may be the game for you! However unless you like checking all your updates, drivers, game files and messing around with every setting and program you have to the tune of I spent too much money for some virtual frustration doesn't sound like something you wish to do, you may wish to avoid this hidden gem.

The game itself is pretty good, I found it enjoyable on the rare occasion where I could get it to launch, however in the current state of not being able to play the damn thing, I would recommend you shy away from this title for now.

EDIT:
Nope...still doesn't work...They have only had over 2 months to fix this issue, guess I will try again in a year...

EDIT #2:
Well, I do not know how long it took them to make it so this game can actually run, but they did it! The game is honestly quite fun, there is a lot to do in it and a great many of vehicles to collect and drive. That said, even though I am finally able to play it, it still crashes for not apparent reason when loading into your garage at times.

In closing the game is fun, don't pay full price, it's not that fun. I just can't change my negative review on it because at the point this game came to steam it was a few years old already on PC, it should have ran fine. Ultimately it was the lack of support (no support at all) from the developers as they already had my money and clearly did not give a hoot about anything after that which will keep this game at a negative review.",0
456,"The Steam port is AWFUL. Game would freeze at every cinematic and was a stuttering mess. I tried a number of the less involved fixes (I was not about to fully reinstall my C++ distros or Windows for a broken game). 

Check the forums before purchasing this game, my experience is not unique. This might be the first review I've ever written for a game in the 15 years I've been on Steam. It's that bad. Buy at your own peril and be ready to get a refund.",0
457,Just love the game. Must play game. Highly recommend it.,1
458,"It could be the best racing game ever but this is the only one game on my computer that's crashed with no reason. (As many people say it's fixable but it's the most popular problem that developers can't solve directly) I am not able to turn off music completely which is one of the most annoying thing in the game. You're not able to teleport between racing tasks just for free which is only developers' policy and that sucks! When you restart the race you must wait loading and then start the race again, you can't restart the race quickly. Sometimes you must watch LEGO advertising for 1-2 minutes after the race and you can't skip it until you buy the LEGO DLC I guess. A lot of things in the game you can't skip and must watch it or listen to it, for example some introduction of something and ect. You must spend plenty of your personal time for nothing instead of enjoying and playing the game. I'm sure this game was created to suffer slowly and painfully, if you want it you'll get it.",0
459,"No stuttering freezing, or otherwise performance related issues like others have reported.

HOWEVER....

Twice now I have been invaded by unstoppable, no exit option in game adverts to buy more add on packs.

I'm sorry, I have a mind and a wallet of my own, I do not like advertisements, I do not appreciate them, and if you are going to force them down my throat, the VERY LEAST you can do is give me an option to stop the advertisement without forcing me to sit through all 60-90 seconds of it.

I will no longer play if I am not allowed to just play my game that I paid for and must be forced to sit through advertisements in the MIDDLE of the game.

461,"Finally the game got a release on steam (i really hate microsoft store but not the game) altough its not a perfect port, its still ok

the Steam version had some issues with stutter, more frequent crash and a slower loading times than the microsoft store, i can see that they are try to fix it but not all of em got fixed yet atm

thanks to regional pricing i can actually bought the game on steam in my region (cuz the ms version didnt really support mine yet)

if you have the ms version i suggest you dont buy the steam version because the steam version a way more unstable than the ms ver, but if you didnt have it and the steam version is cheaper go get it because its a fun game

A ton of cars compared to older forza series (duh), graphics that look amazing enough, great arcade handling and good amount of official tracks and player created tracks that can makes the game more engaging

But the game have no structure or a notable character like the old forza series thanks to drivatar system that for a lot of people including me can get bored quickly because how bland the main game is bercause, if you want to feel that fun when racing againts darius flint or zaki malik or a street race hubs this is not the game
because many features have been deleted over the years. Horizon 4 does not look anything like what a 4th game in a successful series should look like after 8 years of series development.

466,"The best racing game ever, can be enjoyed by both arcade fans and simulation fans. It has great graphics, a dope soundtrack, awesome gameplay and a truckload of content. There's a lot of customisation here for everything, from cool vinyls to tuning alignments and so much more. But the Steam version has quite a few technical issues, there is a bit of random stutter, there is no cross-save between Steam and Microsoft Store and there is no support for Impulse triggers on Xbox controllers. Also, the pricing is way too high for a 3 year old game imo. I would recommend buying this after a few patches and during a sale.

Edit1: The game crashes way too often after the recent stability update, would not recommend buying this right now! Online matchmaking is a joke too, you could start working hard and buy an actual sports car before this game puts you in an online race ffs, and when you do find a race, you would be rammed out of checkpoints by your own teammates making you contemplate your life choices and have an existential crisis.

Edit2: Just buy Forza Horizon 5!",0
467,Driving is fun and the world looks great.,1
468,racing game,1
469,"At first, I was highly skeptical of this game given what I heard about its open world and gacha-esque ""wheelspin"" system. For context, I highly disliked almost all open world games I played prior to this game.

However, I eventually warmed up to the game - mostly because of the driving and car customizing aspect (e.g. liveries, car body parts, etc). While I did not specifically come into the game with an expectation of extensive customization features, what *was* present did pleasantly surprise me. 

Another thing I'd like to add - one that's a positive for me, but as I understand might be a negative for others - is the lack of strict progression enforcement. This game is self-paced in nature with multiple reward tracks, and the ""PI class"" (i.e. speed class) system for cars serve as a means to limit car eligibility for certain events instead of being an arbitrary progression marker. Therefore, a D-class car will be grouped with other D-class cars; S2-class cars with other S2-class cars; and so on, and so forth. You *don't* start from the bottom and follow some ""win your way to the top"" plot. So if you want, you can right away get to driving and racing in hypercars or offroad rally cars.",1

475,"After 300 hours, I'm changing my recommendation and here is why:
+ best open world action racing game out there
+ lots of cars, activities, driving styles, online/offline content
+ beautiful visuals, balanced physics (for action racing), good car handling
The point is, FH4 should not be missed, no matter how many reasons it will give you to quit!
I should caution you though (about the reasons to quit pat):
- FH4 don't like your AV/Firewall, and they don't like FH4 either. But you are on PC, you will figure it out
- Lots of crashes, especially in online. Random crashes too.
- Online loading time is a joke 50% of the time (there are memes about it)
- Lots of broken in-game counters (like star card)
- Lots of broken achievements. Depending on your luck, you could end up not unlocking some. (yes, the one I'm missing is broken)
EDIT: I got my last achievement today, after months of wait!",1
476,"Iam a huge fan of racing games since i was little and i played like fifty different race games and left fifteen years behind with them. and I know well what to look out for when reviewing a racing game.
Forza4 is a strong racing simulation which includes hundreds of different cars.
the variety of cars is really great and nice.
customizations, cars, open world, driving feel, auction house mechanics, places to buy, they are all awesome
One of the weak points of the game is ; it has no soul
Okay you are having good time amazing drivings, races but after some point you are asking yourself whats left to do
You can't physically see when you don't modify or drive the cars you own and thats killing the collector's spirit
you dont have a real garage where you can see al of the cars that you own. you have like a places where you can stay, modify, buy cars and bunch of stuff like that after buying them.
Not even gonna mention about the story because almost there is no story in this game its just good enough for a racing simulation.
A very fun and enjoyable car simulation, apart from a few bad aspects I mentioned.

478,"Personally, I'm a sucker for Forza Horizon 4 and i really love the game but if you already have the Xbox/MS version, Keep in mind the following 

- Saves dont transfer
- There are some buggy differences with MS vs Steam edition, where I've found the MS/Xbox is a lot smoother, this one might stutter a little. 

Probably one of the best Open world racers out there and defo worth a play if you already dont own this and regional pricing favors you ( ive seen it go up to 100$ for ultimate on other regions wtf lol, its like 15$ for base game here )
Also worth it if you want those juicy 180 steam achievs. 
It has some of the cleanest gameplay of any open world racer out there and runs butter smooth, as well as having some really great music in it ( if youre into electronic i suppose )
Otherwise just get the game pass and try this if you're unsure.",1
479,"The game is overpriced. $60 for a 3 years old game is too much but it's hella fun. It is the best racing game for casual players who just want to race in whatever cars they like and don't care much about realism. Forza Horizon 4 is a great successor to FH3 and a great game for people like me who loved good old Test Drive Unlimited games. While it still lacks in its freedom and activities compared to TDU2, FH4 is the closest you're gonna get to that type of racing game.

I've been playing it every day since it came out on steam and I wholeheartedly recommend it if you like this type of casual driving games. There are a couple of issues with it though.
First of all, like I said, it's overpriced. I suggest you wait for a discount before buying it. I would also suggest buying Ultimate Edition or at least getting the VIP DLC because the grinding in this game is hell. VIP DLC will make your life at least more bearable cause you get double the money rewards from races with it. It's a dreadful thing and a terrible practice but because there're no alternatives to this type of games and no competition, we have to play by Microsoft's rules. And one final minor thing is the radio, it sucks, the music is bad, they've removed 2 radio stations from FH3 and overall there's like an hour of songs on each radio that you will hear repeating constantly. The selection of music is just awful compared to FH3, especially for the classical radio, it's the most overplayed pieces like Vivaldi's Spring and Pachelbel'd Cannon in D. If you're not sick of them already, you will be after playing this game for 10 hours and hearing them on a loop over and over again. I suggest that you spend an hour and prepare a Spotify playlist for yourself with the music you like that you can switch to after you get sick of listening to the ingame music, or alternatively just download BBC app for iPhone or Android and listen to BBC Radio 3.",1

It's gonna be fun anyways. A lot of reviews are people crying over not being able to import their saves, even though I bet most of em are hacked modified saves. Also for those who are rating a game based on its sale price, if you had a hugely successful game, where you gotta pay the devs to create updates, and server hosts to hold thousands of players. For a game being this massive, I can understand the $59.99 price tag. The only problem with this price is the pricing difference in other countries. US: $59,99  UK: ‚Ç¨69,99  Just WHY?

It is a good game, but honestly, this game has a LOT of bugs.
-Random crashes (Most Common)
-Occasional Random FPS settings change on game restart (60 - 20)
-Vsync issues
-Collecting a barn find, the first preview is the null car
-Current continue crash if Bluetooth is disabled

Specs: i7 9700K | 16GB | GTX 1080 16GB | 1TB SSD

The game is really good . i had much fun driving around. 
The visuals were amazing ,great physics and a plethora of cars to choose from .
Its a great game however , 
Engine sounds weren't that special it needs work
and the game just gives you cars for free not just 1 or 2 about a 100 cars in my garage i got for free
it just takes away the fun , it gets boring real quick , the campaign was not special either .
It felt plain and lacking - waste of potential i must say
Folks who compare Forza to NFS needs to understand they are both different genres .
Overall a great game . its much cheaper here than at the MS store .",1
511,"Best arcade racing game on the best platform, where it belongs.

Microsoft should've released Horizon 3 on Steam too before their licenses expired.",1

The game worked flawlessly when running through microsoft, but the steam version won't let me use my pedals, shifter, or ebrake.

Logged in using TAB+Spacebar to prompt the microsoft sign in window in windowed mode ALT+Enter and still nothing. Like WTF is wrong with these developers and software programmers making shit stupid complicated that I cant even get pasted the damn menu to begin tweaking settings and actually play this game.

Edit: 27 hours in, 27 crashes.  Support is useless. My machine exceeds the requirements and works great for everything except this damn M$ game.  It's a really fun casual racing game, but it just crashes every hour.  I doubt I will bother with FH5 in the future.",0
521,"First of all, like many of the reviews say, the game itself is still awesome. 

However, a lot of peeps are having trouble with stuttering cutscenes (pre-rendered ones for me), crashing, controller/wheel incompatibility, and of course pricing in different regions. If you own and already enjoyed the MS version, then there is truly little reason to get it again on Steam. I have not encountered any launch issues or crashes throughout my testing and attempts to resolve the stuttering cutscenes. 

As for me, I use a DS4, or Xbox 360 controller, which both work fine. Performance, outside of the stuttering issues, is fantastic (RTX3080). All the content seems to be intact so far. I have no complaints, and I am very happy with the state of the game. If the stuttering is resolved, then I am very grateful to the devs. Although please check other reviews, in case you are using other controllers, and have special setups you used on the MS version.",1
522,"Forza Horizon 4, a female perspective: is it worth a buy?

Video review's link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vhdJ1FlT0o
If you don't feel like watch the video review you can read below 

What kind of masterpieces can we expect from a racing game?
Racing games, a kind of absolute noble born in the gaming industry similar to gun games and ball games. 

Is the speed the only thing that matters in the racing game?
Wake up, a really good racing  game should fulfill the need of the racer‚Äôs desires and strive to simulate the perfect driving experience as well as provide a stepping stone for a new comers and amateurs into the scene

Forza Horizon 4 is a gorgeous visual spectacle. It is varied, challenging, and fast paced

In other words, it‚Äôs got everything you want in a racing game, a worthy purchase!

Frankly speaking , racing game is not always my type of game

There been a serious lack of games over these months, so I took plunge and purchased Forza Horizon 4 that was released on Steam this March 2021

I initially got the base game. However, the game was way better than my expectation so I got LEGO DLC and Fortune Island DLC
Till the video review published, I have contributed more than 100 hours to this game

Besides racing and ranking, let us look at what else is featured  in the game.

Most players talk about handling, car brand,tire grip when turning corners, how to drift and so- called skills.Most players are concerned about how to rank first in a race

But for me, I do kowtow to ranks and not plagued by grey hairs worrying about my skill

Despite coming last, I still have a huge shxt eating grin as I‚Äôve already known the most enjoyable part in the game.

The prologue of Forza Horizon 4 is a 6-7 hour tutorial, an introductory chapter of the titleshowcasing all four seasons with four driving scenarios and leading to the rules of racing, along with describing the controls to the player.

After the prologue, the season in game will change overnight on Thursdays.Apart from season changes in the game, we‚Äôd have a day and night as well. We can also experience weather changes, such as rain, snowstorm or blizzard.The whole car feels so different depending on the changing in environment

The feeling will also be influenced by the puddles, mud and snow on the road.You can feel more immersed if first-person view is enabled

Further to this, I am using XBOX Series gaming controller playing this game. Linear acceleration/braking and road terrain provides differing haptic feedback on the controller, improving the immersion of the driving experience

It‚Äôs hard to imagine that a game that dropped in late 2018can still lead in graphic visuals.

On the game‚Äôs visuals, we can see real world details on the car sceneries, ground and distanced views from far away can show definitive details in the game.

You don‚Äôt have to drive that fast okay?The scenery deserves you to step on the brake and enjoy the view.

Open world, finding fortunes, It looks stunning, and it makes the game feel lively and expensive.

Yes, it is the Legend of Zelda in Car and Red Dead Redemption on the Street

Regardless of the graphics,  the sound design in this game can highlight the art of sound for AAA standard.
when the engine starts, I feel so elated and pumped because of the pur of the engine 

When you are in game, your role is diverse.

Remember that you are not only a racer but also a car modding architect

There is a helpful community online. Newbies can study from experienced players 

It‚Äôs okay if you don't know how to mod your car. You can just download the mod templates for free 

This game has a high level of driving simulation. Meanwhile, you are a car artist 

This game has an insane level of customization. Players can download customisation for free from online community to find a style that suits you the best

This game has character customization. That‚Äôs because it has a living online world

All costumes  are not limited to any particular genders.. if you have particular interests

The customisation function is quite satisfying regardless of the number of costumes. The online community is friendly and treats
it‚Äôs players really well no matter the skill level of that player. The player can dive deeper in the customisation part in the game and upload their work for others to download and install. You can earn likes and support to be reputed and popular with your work. This is similar to the real life

According to people‚Äôs stereotype with female drivers. Racing? No, not because I am not competitive but because I am enjoying the landscape. This mindset is different and not quite equivalent to testosterone fueled competitor‚Äôs goal focused on the finish line.

Oh yeah, I feel so good after playing over 100 hours in Forza Horizon 4

Very relaxing, chilling and satisfying

You should buy it and it is worth buying 

if you really want me to voice my complaints about the game, the unstable server connection is a big issue and long matchmaking. Overall, this game can be enjoyed by anyone and everyone no matter their interests in cars

Yeah, it is worth to buy.",1

528,"I finished this game few times already, and bought it in day 1 on steam too, I still enjoy it as much as I did first time when I played it.
I really relax taking the car and just drive around, with no purpose, just drive and chill...
The only minuses from my point of view are the low aestethics customisation options and... the ONLINE part!
So far this game is the best option I have as a game with cars, I highly recommend it!",1
529,i loved,1
530,"Everything seems alright so far in my 20 hours of game time except for technical issues like random frame drops. I'm running the game on a mid-tier gaming PC and still getting such drops can be a little infuriating. 

There are too many loading screens, seriously. I don't want to wait for 10 seconds everytime I decide to purchase a car from the AutoShow or the Auction. And mind you, there are more than one loading screens involved everywhere. Want to buy your favourite car from the auction house for cheap? Too bad, you had 3 loading screens and someone else took that offer and now its gone. 

There are clear optimisation issues with this game that can be fixed by the devs but they don't seem to care about FH4 while FH5 is scheduled to release in 5 months so don't expect to get any bug fixes or patch updates at all. 

8/10 for getting everything right but the technical side of things.",1

532,freezes and crashes. got no time for that,0
533,"As a huge fan of the Forza franchise in general, I've always loved the Horizon series. I was really glad this game finally made its way over to Steam, but it's not without its flaws.
This game crashes. A lot. Every time, there's a different error, so I'm not really sure what the issue is, or how to  fix it. Some days it'll be fine and I can play for hours with no problems, but other days it will crash repeatedly over the course of an hour. So buyer be warned.
Now that that's out of the way; the game itself is awesome. It's very similar to The Crew (although The Crew technically took Horizon's formula), but with a slightly more simulation-oriented approach. If you want even more of a sim, you can always pump up the difficulty and grind more xp too. But it's arcade-y enough to sink plenty of hours into, especially with its numerous races and classes, and even changing seasons with new objectives. Did I mention this is also a better rally sim than Dirt 5? Because it is.
There are also ""drivatars"" which are essentially player ghosts that will compete with you, and are a ton of fun to play against and pose a real challenge (I love playing co-op events and competing against them with other players on my team). Another feature is that you can link your Microsoft account to get achievements and progress for both Steam and the Microsoft companion app. I personally like that feature, as I used to be very focused on achievement hunting back in my Xbox 360 days, but I can also see why some people might not like that. Speaking of Microsoft though... at the time of this writing, it's currently the Autumn season in-game, and one of the events is called ""The Pillar of Autumn,"" and you're tasked with racing a Warthog as Master Chief while maneuvering around obstacles from Halo as you follow a Pelican and avoid Banshees. Pretty cool.
Each Horizon game takes place in a different location on the globe, and this one was the UK. It's cool to see landmarks and race across the British countryside (of course not entirely accurate), but honestly the British accents got old quick. Sometimes the characters try too hard to be relevant in the dialogue, but that's just me. It is still interesting to see though, and I like that you get to work with Top Gear BBC, explore monuments, and race around a new environment.
Overall I have been really enjoying this game. I think it was added to Steam much too late (it was originally released in 2017), but I'm glad it's finally here. That being said, I don't think it's worth the full price tag. I'd wait until it's at least on sale for $30 or less.",1
534,WHY DOES IT KEEP FUCKIN CRASHING!!!!!! LET ME PLAY THE GAME FFS.,0
535,yes,1
536,"I've played this game in XBOX game pass and I couldn't resist to purchase this game. I was a bit disappointed when there was an announcement that there would be no cross save but then I bought it anyway. I was level 201 in my game pass and now that I own the ultimate edition, it didn't take long to get to where I was. This game is easily one of the best racing games ever made. The graphics is amazing, the game physics is very realistic and it feels like this game is specifically tailored to be played with friends. I would definitely recommend you to at least try this game in game pass if the price seems a bit steep.
Overall Review: 9/10 (Because of a few annoying bugs)",1
537,One of the best racing game coop with friend. Having fun racing along with friend in Coop mode to beat the Drivatar..,1
538,"really good game would definately recommend.
also would suggest using a controler or a wheel cuz thats way easier then keyboard

Edit:
My review was made when I had 50 hours in the game, 
this update is made when I have 150 hours in the game.

I genuinly love the game, its open word, every week you get missions to get free cars, there are story-like missions to gain some money from businesses you own. exploring is a lot of fun, trying to get the fastest in a certain race or speedtrap is pretty fun.
the AI in this game is also really good.
I would recommend if you like cars and open world
I use a controler when I'm playing, but you can also play with keyboard
and the game looks really good
how it feels to drive the car is better then any other game in my opinion and the drifting is soooo much fun.

544,"I wrote these for you, the friend who is thinking about buying the game, trying to get an idea in the comments who will buy or have bought it. Please take a few minutes and read your thoughts. The fact that some of us are in situations where we are afraid to pass by these cars or cannot even bother to imagine, they have helped us feel these cars, even if a little, instead of imagining these vehicles in this geography we live in.

Ladies and gentlemen, as a player who really likes racing games, I really liked it. Thanks to the Forza Horizon 4 team, thank you Microsoft, thank you Xbox Game Studios and most importantly Bill Gates, Paul Gardner Allen. Thanks for everything

Yes, as a player and because of some companies, I have to write this objective view for the games we will play in the future and you have to write like me. Because I believe there can be more beautiful and more for a better FH.

I'll log in directly. The map of Forza Horizon 4 is completely mediocre. As a person who really spends a lot of time on racing games, I will convey my objective comments to you, I am sure that I will make comments that most of them will not like, but I have never adopted the understanding of a player who eats whatever is put in front of us, I am sure you are too.

They do not release this game made for us because they love us very much. We are the ones who will express our opinions and wishes and make the next game better. If we do not do this, a few cars etc. It is quite possible that they will add more and put it in front of us.

We shouldn't be fans of anything. We should call good bad and bad bad. I see this as an easy to do, guaranteed game. I have no problem with game mechanics. Suppose the map is as big as the map of the game CREW2, wouldn't it be better for this game? There are cars with 1500 horsepower in this game but there is no way to go.

The game is really a live game physics engine is great, but we are stuck in Edinburgh. It's compressed in a tiny map. The first game of the FH series was set in America and the map was satisfactory at that time. Again, it was not as much as a Test Drive Unlimited, but then the customization and physics engine was attracting us. However, vehicle sounds and customization are really very little. It needs improvement and they can do that. But they really don't do that.

They should take Crew 2 as an example in terms of map and city configuration details, I know the physics engine in The Crew 2 is mediocre, but as a player I wasn't just racing. We can only play The Crew2 for nature and scenery.

What kind of festival is this? Make a huge map, or in 6 or 1 years, let's get the new map dlc. I'm throwing the festival in Los Angeles this month, Miami next month, Texas etc etc, next month, let's get instant meetings and go from Texas to Orlando, the map is big, and if There must be illegality in the game, even if it is not in the horizon series. In a game that reaches the speed of airplanes, there is no limit to what we burn and demolish. Don't let it feel like they've closed us somewhere, in these games, nobody should be fan-sized, if you don't criticize, you will be exposed to the same every time ...

Do you think it should be such a game to be a really perfect game? I think old NFS players will know what I mean. You watched a video on the internet or bought the game, played it for 20-30 hours and put it aside, but if you ask, the game is great. What's super? Should the racing game be just a CAR? Apart from the graphics, driving mechanics and steering feel, it is an empty game.

They made a tiny map, but almost all of it is grass, field. They kept using almost the same sound in cars. We play the same races all the time, they don't even try to make different routes.The 5th game is guaranteed to go on sale a few months after its release on Steam. It may even happen this year. 

But in the consciousness of what I have written, consider my reproaches, experiment and interpret them as such. Let's be aware that we have a say in these matters as well, instead of what is put in front of you. Be sure, better games will come and rip to do better. Just state your thoughts for better games.

I am appealing to you as a playful person.

Don't you have any dreams of a racing game other than just driving a car????",1

The graphics in this game are truly amazing and you just have to see it for yourself. The only thing in this game that is not flawless is the cut-seens that are often glitchy and lagged. Other than that there is nothing not perfect about it and is truly the best driving/racing games out there.,1

There are too many things to do and you are overwhelmed with events, races, more events all over the map and you do not know where to go and what to do first. SOOOOOO many tabs in the menu. It's confusing. 

But, cars are super detailed and look damn good. Still getting used to some tracks because there are too many of them and you just cannot remember them all. I also hate drifting. I am not sure how should it be done but I am just not good at it. Even in a drift car.",1
560,"Tons of fun in a somewhat sim but mostly arcade racing game with a ton of stuff to do. I bought Ultimate Edition, which has a whole ton of extras, but normal version is great as well. I think.

Update after 45 hours.
Absolutely love the game. I dislike some issues and certain choices made during development but absolutely love the game in general. Will probably reach 100+ hours before I do everything the game has to offer.
You can find all the info about the graphics, performance, gameplay elsewhere. For me this is plain best somewhat-simulator mostly-arcade racing game made with large open world at this time that runs so well on my PC.

FH5 will probably dethrone FH4. As FH4 did for FH3. And as FH3 did for Test Drive Unlimited(s) and NFS: Porsche Unleashed, Burnout: Paradise, GRID and lots of others. Although I'd love to play a few of those again some day. Maybe.

Anyways, buy it if you're an arcade racing fan and are looking for an open-world racing game. It has some level of simulation experience, but, according to some people, simulating real world physics was not the main priority here.",1

My only pet peeve, is that for a game that doesn't have more than 20 tracks on certain stations, you can't turn off the radio as a permanent option in the game, streamer mode is no good, since you have to turn it on everytime on open the game, and it defaults to a single station that you gotta press again to turn off the radio. And come on, gta that has way bigger music library, allows you to completely turn it off. for gameplay, save when cutscenes have it as background music on a radio.
I still really enjoy this game, just beware that a few users report alot of problems with stuttering on their systems, i unfortunately can't say the same experience",1
573,I mean.. you have toyota in this game,1
574,"Honestly I really wanted to get into this game as im into racing games and most say this is the pinnacle of the recent ones.
This game does a lot right and few wrong. But the negatives are a real bummer.

Ill start off with the good parts.
The world is dope and beautiful , the world is filled with highly detailed vegetation and other assets and is a joy to cruise around.
The Driving itself is pretty good and the fact that it can be switched from semi arcade to semi sim is great as i play on both controller and a wheel. So i go arcade on controller and sim on my wheel.
The  crossovers and the special events are great and can be alot of fun.
The game is pretty good with optimisation as it runs pretty good for the visual it has, but i did notice high temps.
The Lego DLC can be fun but again has the same issues with progression. (You are given a Bugati Divo in an hour of game play)
There is a lot more in the game that is great and most reviews cover that. so i wont be.

Now off to the negatives.
The game simply has no progression which is the worst thing for me as this removes any kind of satisfaction or drive to simply play the game. The game throws events at you and races for doing basically nothing.
The game also throws money at you and super and hyper cars within the fist few hours of the game and that's just not fun at least for me.
The A.I In the game is simply not fun as either you are lapping them or they are lapping you depending on the difficulty and there seems to be no middle ground.
And although the game is beautiful and the streets seems dead and not very fun, but this is generally isn't to much of any issue as most of the map is open highways but the urban areas seem bland for the same reason.
 I purchased the standard edition of the game as i thought i would grind out the game and get good cars myself and i purchased the dlcs separate but it was no use as i got a pretty good garage within my first 4 hours of game play.

Overall if you like progression and an actually reason to play i would not suggest you pick up the game.But if you are super casual and just hope of a few hours a week this game is great as you can experience a lot in very little time.

i did speak to a couple of people that loved they game and all of em did agree to the issue i had the game but still found it fun so id say pick up a month of game pass and decide from there if you wanna pick it up on steam.

575,Literally my favorite racing game out there! Owned the ultimate edition on windows store and bought the ultimate edition here as well!!! rip my wallet but so glad this game is on steam now!,1
576,"Completely new to Forza. Bought this on an impulse. Did not realize I was paying $60 for a 3-year-old game, but I'm not even mad.  ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø",1

578,Have played it before on the Microsoft Store. And then Bought it the moment it was released on Steam (at a much cheaper rate than the MS Store). Worth every penny. But my save game could not be imported from the Store version which was sad.,1
579,"This Steam version stutters every couple of seconds as other people have said before, it's technically ''playable'' but it's very annoying to play like that, while the Microsoft store version plays flawlessly (the demo version specifically).

It's been 4 months since the Steam version has released and they still haven't fixed it yet... if they ever will.

So just get the Microsoft store version.",0

Let me repeat that:

I paid for this game

This game forced me to watch an UNSKIPPABLE add after I paid for it.",0
583,IS THAT A SUPRAAAA,1
584,Best. My best second Forza I've ever played. Best gameplay and handling nonetheless.,1
585,Great game. That is all that matters.,1
586,"Crash Horizon 4

FIX THE DAMN GAME",0
587,"Forza Horizon 4 is one of a kind. It has state-of-the-art graphics and scenery. I can say the biggest enjoyment is the passive progression players can do by just driving around. 

The vehicle tuning system is extremely sophisticated and I personally think it's worth the game alone. They also have a large variety of cars....brands you didn't even know existed if you from my side of the world. 

With regards to it's price...as much as it is popular belief that the game is excessively expensive, I myself personally feel it is entirely worth the price. 

Regarding the Paid DLC.....both Lego Speed and Fortune Island are packed with an adventurous drive. 

Lego Speed I'd describe as a chaotic destructive Lego world and loaded with a ton of content. 

Fortune Island is self-explanatory . It is worth if you see a quick way to get a nice large lump sum to kit yourself out with a large variety of fun cars.

The soundtrack in the game is nothing short of beautiful. I have my own Forza playlist with all the games OST in it.

This game becomes more and more fun the more you play it which is really rare to find nowadays for me. The various racing events really showcase this games strengths. The overall driving experience still leans more to a arcade feel (using a controller) but its challenging enough to create a overall nice feel it's definitely much better than a game like The Crew 2. Graphics/map and the actual cars are really top notch as well.

Updated for badge.",1
607,Multiplayer doesnt work thank you xbox. Wasted my money on this shit.,0
608,"Pros:
- Beautiful Graphics.
- Tons of cars from hundreds of manufacturers around the world to choose from.
- Great variety of races (Netflix and Disney love this).
- Large and diverse map (More diverse than Oscar).
- Forgiving physics for new players, challenging for old ones.
- 4 weathers that changes every week.
- Cockpit view.
- Runs like a dream on peasant's hardware. (R7 3700X  32GB Ram 1070 - Max setting 80fps @1080p)

Cons:
- Piss poor engine sound.
- People drive on the wrong side of the road.
- Unrealistic portrait of England (too little rain, zero fog)
- Toyota and Lexus are locked behind challenges and festival pass.
- Difficulties of challenges are inconsistent.
- No newly released cars, only 2019 backward.
- Can't lower roof of convertibles.
- Can't run over animals and people.",1

622,"The game is crashing literally EVERY SECOND ranked race. Game is basically not capable of loading cars at random. Sometimes they load, sometimes the game crashes. 
I know I played more than 100+ hrs in, but RIGHT NOW it is unplayable for a competitive player like me. I dont want to play vs bots and I CANT play ranked cause I play one game, win or lose, second adventure is GUARANTEED to crash. I want my deserved refund as this is an actual robbery to sell such a poorly working product here. 

STAY AWAY FROM THIS GAME",0
623,"Don't listen to others saying the game ain't worth it paying full price for a 3 year old game the fact that not even a 1 year old game can compete in the Forza Horizon series. Forza Horizon is the best open world car game you can get. ( currently ). I do however agree that some countries are facing an overpriced price for this game and it really is not worth it to pay that much. Luckily in my country, (Malaysia) costs only MYR 169 which is around USD 41$ for the Ultimate Edition. So, because of that, I paid full price for it considering it is cheaper than in Microsoft store's price (MYR 388 = 94 USD).

Also, I've read the reviews from the veterans who played this game from Microsoft store platform and can't transfer their account data to steam. I have to agree that is also another con from this game. So, because of that, this game is not for those who wanted to transfer their account data from Microsoft to Steam ( at least not yet ).  But if you are new to the game, definitely worth getting it.

Anyways, game is a blast. played Forza Horizon 3 on Microsoft platform and had fun with it and now playing Forza Horizon 4 on Steam! Best decision i've ever made. Get it only if you are new to the game and if its available on a cheap a.k.a reasonable price to buy in your country. The game is worth it nonetheless.",1
624,What Need for Speed was trying to be,1
625,Why I can't transfer my progress in Forza 4 to Steam?! Why Forza 4 don't support cross cloud saving between Microsoft store and Steam?! I don't want to start from the beginning!!!,0

627,"PLEASE DONT BUY IF YOU ARE PLAYING WITH A WHEEL. Wheel support is broken


Main reason not to recommend this game is you cannot play with a wheel properly and no multiple USB devices are supported. 

FFB is clipped and broken for my G29 Logitech. 

If you want to play with a controller or keyboard like NFS Heat, go ahead.",0
628,"Hands down the best racing game I've played over the years. 
Graphics are amazing, controls are great, they're keeping the game updated.

629,"I love it preety much the second it throwed me into that intro, racing through all the seasons and what not really looking forward to play more and get some cool cars maybe who knows?",1
630,"Dope! I'm not a huge racing game fan, but Forza Horizon 4 is a lot of fun. From what I can tell it's a happy medium between an arcade styled racer and a simulation (Maybe just slightly leaning a bit more towards simulation).

The game is extremely optimized, I'm running ultra settings at 1440p getting around 85-100fps depending on particle effects and shadows on screen. This game with everything turned up looks gorgeous, and is such a visual treat. (I have a 2070 Super paired with an R5 3600 for reference with 16gb of ram.) The actual gameplay is pretty tight and the cars feel nice to drive, though I'm not racing game expert this is just a layman's perspective. The customization is also pretty decent and for tuners you can really mess with stuff to get your cars handling the way you want for better or worse (If you go for meme builds). 

The only issues I have are some odd frame stutters here and there but never during actual gameplay. Also the voice acting and the characters kind of leave a lot to be desired. Plus the overall soundtrack is just passable. 

Although Horizon 4 is just beautiful to look at (I keep mentioning this but it's 1), and there's just so much content here from all the cars to unlock, modes, and just the single player ""campaign"". You can also just drive around the large hub world while taking in the scenery of the fictional representation of the UK, it's super relaxing (Even though sometimes the map can feel a little same-y, although seasons really help with the aesthetic). Can't comment on the multiplayer, but I've heard generally good things about the experience there for those interested in that content. 

Overall tons of value especially if you can pick this up on sale, Horizon 5 is just around the corner in a couple of months as of the time I write this, but the community in 4 is still lively for those that want to engage with it. If you're just in for the single player content alone there's still a lot of fun, achievements, and cars to collect. All-in-all super content rich racing game that anyone can enjoy.",1
631,RIP .....NFS Franchise...!!,1
632,"It s been a while since i actually enjoyed a racing game this much. Great game. Stunnig visuals. Incredible soundtrack. They actually included one of my favourite tracks from Odesza.

Me: Opens Forza Horizon 4
Press A To Start
Me: LET ME HEAR THE ENTIRE SONG FIRST",1
633,"Greatest car game out there, tons of cars, activities, gamemodes and maps and ofc beautiful graphics.

Can't talk about the price since i received this game for free (thanks Playground games!) but i did played this game over on Xbox Game Pass, like 40 hours, shame i can't use my savegames from there in Steam.

Steam version of the game does have stuttering and performance issues right now that the devs stated will get fixed.

Worst part (aside from the previous point) of the game to talk about something bc it's hard to find anything bad, maybe it's the ability to change any car into beast by doing a motor swap, most of the cars become undrivable and they lose their distinct sound. Also the GPS voice and voice over on the ""history"" bits can get a bit annoying when you just want to drive. Also again, pls let me turn off the music/radio??

If you either want to just grab your modified car over the hills and have a relaxed drive with your own music or race in the numerous game modes, if you like cars and videogames this is your game.",1
634,fix the damn game microsoft SMH,0
635,"This game is BEAUTIFUL and FUN. 

That's all.",1
636,CAR,1
637,Good!,1
638,"It's a love-hate relationship with FH4. The game has so much variety and insists upon you that you try all of it when not all of it may be your cup of tea. If you want to get the rarer ""backstage pass"" cars prepare for offroad events, random BS challenges, 1000 HP 90s BMWs, and tons of forced multiplayer ""fun"". 

Cars handle great, the seasons are varied and distinct although I wish you could force it to always stay summer because sometimes I just don't feel like driving in rain/snow. Car detail, sound in particular, falls short of Forza's usual standard but is still good. The car lineup is also good although it pads its numbers with a lot of cars 99% of players won't care about. The soundtrack is excellent and the map is good although I wish it would have a second open highway segment. 

It's a phenomenal racing game held back by horrible progression. It's a perfectly cooked rib-eye, but the chef makes you eat some under cooked sides before you can enjoy the main dish.",1
639,"I havn't been able to connect online for months, I've tried almost every fix I found online and I still can't connect to online play. I'm not putting a single penny more into this game or its counter parts until I can saftly assume I will be able to play the game online",0
640,"Super addictive, I sold my real life car so that I could afford Steering wheel set and a gaming chair. My wife kicked me out of the house. Totally worth it.",1
641,Best arcade ever,1
642,Best open world racing game with a great environment with more than 700+ cars and still counting ... the game is fun and has variety pvp modes survival racing modes and also random events popping here and there in the map. as a racing game fan the the best feature i love about this game is the blueprint editor where you can make a custom racing track and grind your own way to earn that sweet money ... also the game offers festival series where for participation or for winning races they provide your free cars what more do you need. 100% recommend this game to all racing genre favorites.,1
643,Good Game,1
644,Microsoft decided to remove impulse trigger support from Horizon 4 on steam while on windows store it works and Horizon 5 on steam has it as well. I do not recommend it just because of that. Otherwise it is the best arcade racing game on the market along with the Horizon 5.,0
645,"A bit salty that my progress from when I played this through gamepass on PC didn't carry over even after xbox log-in, but leaving that aside this game is still the best casual driving type around. From the graphics to the handling of the cars and customising the looks, tuning the car, it's well worth the money during sale. It has enough content to keep one busy for well over a year, can enjoy it till FH5 comes on sale xD",1
646,"why i cant use wheel ?
",0
647,"Constant crashing (possible to get your save corrupted), stuttering, uneven gaming experience, the game randomly slows then suddenly speeds up typically putting you in a ditch or missing a checkpoint and this is not related to frame rate.

Playing co-op (mostly seasonal events, stories and businesses) sometimes kicks everyone in convoy from event or after completion, the game hangs and says ""waiting for other players"" even when everyone had finished.

Online adventures are a nightmare, you can literally wait 15-20 minutes between each race and loading while game ""fast travels other players..."" and then when the game finally loads, the lobby is empty because everyone had given up and closed the game.

Don't get me wrong the game is nice and fun to play but there are just too many problems, it gives an unpleasant experience especially when playing with a friend or playing online.",0
648,Crashes constantly,0
649,"The game is constantly crashing which makes the game literally unplayable...
If you are considering to purchase this game, I would recommend to wait until the crashes are fixed.",0
650,The best racing game,1
651,"I'm in the top 1% of the world : and I wholeheartedly recommend this game, even if it's your first. There's time to finish this at least 6 times before FH5 Nov 9 2021,

TLDR: You don't need a NFS game in your life ever again. This is worth it at full price, for ultimate edition - ESPECIALLY For south africans - but all others can also compare with MS Store first [for us it's 3x more, and ultimate edition isn't even available on their store, for us africans].

After 594 hours, there's nothing better on steam for your racing. It's addictive. It's fresh. If you're not turning at high speeds like you want to, add a toe-in angle here and there, and test on. Goliath is my money maker.

I've achieved being in the top 2~6% of many events in the game, from rivals, to speed traps, drifting, etc. It's incredible, and still awesome to redo challenges. [Xbox Controller]

THEN: TO FIX IT< Support on Microsoft/ Forza Reimbursed ALL my cars that were lost. like 99% of them, so that;'s 'okay' 

The most incredible racing game you could invest your time in. Buy almost any car that has existed, then modify it, then tune it, then give it a new paint job. Then add decals, Then show off to friends, then beat your friends with it. WHAT MORE DO YOU NEED?!?!

You won't need to buy other games from racing genre for a long time if you buy this. It's got street racing, sprints, circuits, night time street racing,  cross-country , off-road, drifting, speed traps, You can own properties. I'm 114 hours in , and only experience Summer, and Autumn so far, 
Online play is rewarding, you get challenges to complete/goals/tasks/missions to earn in-game points so that you can keep getting new content. It's insanely beautiful and amazing at everything it does! 

You can use Rivals mode if you want to race for best times, and without collisions - to get very good money, and you will feel the challenge. :) 

Just one more race, just one more drive across Britain. It's incredible, and immersive, and super fun to drive the biggest variety of cars you could ever find in any single game.

This is a blessing to finally have on Steam! Life's so good and blessed in this game, i wish it were real life. 
-Horizon Wheel Spin WINS - are delightful to keep winning,
-You just keep earning the more you drive and the many different terrains you tackle, when you drive :D

Older cars: Opt to drive manually, for your own sake- their lack of power on the hills is best controlled by you and driving in lower gear.

There is strategy in what you choose to upgrade - to keep it within it's class you're trying to race it in, or based on the terrain of the track, or, based on what your opponents are riding. It's DEEP!!

TLDR: Ultimate RPG Driving game, ever. Multiple types of events on the map. Left-hand driving world : Britain - Multiple seasons -Great with a controller. Each car feels VERY Unique - Super powerful content. network latency can stop the game from rendering correctly ? When you have the 90+GB package locally installed. It's many pluses- and many minuses all wrapped into one. Your system needs to be running the latest Driver-Updates for your hardware- or this game will crash, frequently, and randomly!

Thread for if you have crashes:
https://steamcommunity.com/app/1293830/discussions/0/3167694551625342747/

Just ran the game for 5.5 hours without issue - No crash. Vsync on thanks to a friend letting me know {GanjaM}

Guess what, i installed 24 drivers for my system today,  Windows remains version 1909 - I just drove 12KM without a crash. Your entire device needs to be up-to-date- besides OS to make this game stop crashing. 
Still running admin mode,  
But I just alt-tabbed for this review update 
AND _+ South Africans ; ALL OF YOU SHOULD BUY ULTIMATE EDITION _ Steam loves you.
but NOW< it feels like I'm actually in the game!!!
16GB RAM 
i5 10400f 
GTX1070 :) Zotac AMP EXTREME _ Prefer maximum performance 

[spoiler]
Downloading and installing Windows 20H2 - and if this fixes the game.. then this is the level we need to be on to make it work.. :) Driving 7.2KM to my next race and not crashing will be a clear indication if it worked OR NOT<But I really hope it fixes it !!! Trying to update windows since 3 April 2021! has been a separate nightmare - legit version and all - Updated 24 drivers, to make the windows update tool start, is also another story., . Eventually I just had to make Microsoft part of the process :> and got lots of love from their team, and support all the way. 

I tried blocking in the firewall, just the webhelp, unblocking them one at a time, 
Running at Vsync, not running Vsync,  - always crashes
Full screen mode off - and on -
Tried unplugging my WACOM tablet.. same crash on continue .>.<.
Adding exclusion to the entire steam directory for Windows Defender -still crashes, 
Setting up nvidia profile
Getting stuck upgrading windows with update at 99% for more than 28+ Hours, 
Because it's  from 2018, I'm trying Windows 7 compatibility mode -LEL - Loads for almost quadruple the time, to still crash. 
Admin mode on, off, it's just not 'Continuing'
nothing is working to fix this,,, It's super disappointing,. I will NOT suffer sleepless nights over this, and clearly a patch is required to fix this , meant to be arriving 1 month after release -in the week of 5-9 April 2021
I'm back to the point of pressing Continue - where the game loads -Finishes loading - CRASH TO DESKTOP
When this game is fixed, my review will be in a positive state,  because this game has SO MUCH to offer, and it's amazing - and pretty to look at, but it just will not run. Crash at your garage, browsing cars. Crash before 7.2KM on  a drive... 

It was more disappointing than Cyberpunk 2077 - for a 2018 game to fail like this on windows 10...using a patch newer than this release!

It looks BEAUTIFUL :) 
It Plays smooothly - par- i was streaming, and corners being taken, and passing cars, I see dips in FPS,  
BUT MAYBE I SHOULD TURN STEAM OVERLAY OFF TOO!?
4th Crash for now- running the EXE  as Admin - After winning the race, score menu ? can't handle skipping??? On the exact same continue point?!?! 
REFUND 
Then UNREFUNDED _because i want this damn game to work!
Turning off steam overlay now - doesn't work. Crashes resuming where i left off. 
Press the continue button - loads in- pretends it's loading in - then suddenly your desktop is visible again.

modified nvidia control panel to let this game handle a lot of itself, [Application Controlled] 
Windows version 1909 - 
Streamed for almost 2 hours -  OBS Studio - issues - coming now, when not streaming?

652,"I love the series of forza horizon 
but this game is wooow
it has some problems like crashing , statturing and the feedback of g920 is horrible ; you need to play in the control settings to adjust it perfectly",1
653,"don't read into weather i would recommend this game too much, i love the game and played for years on xbox and when i had seen it had been released on steam after moving over to pc i was really excited that i could now play it  on here, only problem is it crashes all the time at random times, i could be in a menu, free roaming or half way through a race, i have tried everything i can to resolve the issue going off what others have done and still have the same issue the same as everyone else who has tried. 

i really wanted to put a review up saying to ignore the price and to just buy it but after spending most of my time trying to sort the issue i'm now stuck with a broken game.

if the issues get fixed then i'm more than happy to rewrite my review but for the time being its just more frustrating than anything else",0
654,"This game has to be one of the most stunning looking games out there. This game has an overwhelming amount of cars. The cars are very dynamic and have amazing attention to detail. The sound design is also pretty great. The physics handle like an arcade style racing game, which is perfect because that's exactly what it is. We're screwing around modifying and buying cars and ramming through the walls :P . This game truly is incredible .",1
655,"I got the Ultimate Edition because it was on sale, and it ruined the game for me.

My very first car was almost completely upgraded, right off the bat. I've been gifted a half dozen high-end vehicles, and my account has over a million dollars in it. The only way I can lose a race is to turn the AI to the max difficulty, but that just gives them a huge power boost, so they fly past you even in the same car. I've only been playing for four hours, and it feels like the game is over, with nothing new to discover.

There are a few other issues that are way more annoying to deal with than they sound like:

- YOU CAN'T TURN THE MUSIC OFF. You can turn it down to 1, but not 0. There's an unrelated menu option and an in-game control that together, mostly fix it, but you have to do both of them every time you load the game.
- You can swap vehicles before most races - but not all! So you have to back out, open the map, load the garage, filter it down, select the car, and wait for the load. Fixable, but super annoying.
- You can *create* custom car setups any time, but can only *load* them when you're in a garage. So you either pay a ton of money to fast travel both ways, which destroys half the gameplay, or drive miles out of your way for every race, which is just tedious.
- Why are there LEGO ads on the loading screens? It's really weird to suddenly see LEGO people when you've been driving high-res models of real cars for a couple hours.",0
656,Yes,1
657,"believe me or not but i'm writing this review while waiting for the game to start an online race (btw i've already been waiting for 17 minutes), so basically it's a good looking and fun game, but it's not that nice when you wanna play with your friends or go online and compete with other players, because when you try to play any online race the game turns into a WAITING SIMULATOR",0
658,Final-freaking-ly,1
659,"A very good game, i have this game on XBox, and had to buy it again here on Steam. For me it is one of the best Racing Games made till now, and can only say other people to buy this game.",1
660,"The price is high for such an old release, especially if you bought it already since you are not able to use your old save so my lv 2k+ account cannot be continued. Still, its one of the, if not the best arcade car games out there.",1
661,Games does not start and tried a very very long list of suggested fixes.,0
662,Probably the best car game to play. There's so many cars to choose from and a lot of modifications you can try out. I feel like every car person would get enjoyment out of this game.,1

673,Overpriced even when on special at 50% off and does not work well with Logitech Steering wheel.  I cannot play this game with the wheel no matter how much I fiddle with the settings. So if you're looking for a good racing game to play on your wheel maybe consider a different game.,0
674,"I absolutely love racing games. It‚Äôs not reflected on my Steam profile very well, but the racing genre is easily one of my favourites, and has been since I was very young. I experienced countless different titles on the Xbox and PS2 when I was still primarily a console gamer. From bigger names like Need for Speed and Gran Turismo, to plenty of other lesser known titles like Crash ‚Äòn‚Äô Burn, L.A. Rush, Midtown Madness 3 and so many more, I spent countless hours messing around in those early open worlds and improving my lap times. Most Wanted 2005 is easily my favourite racing title, with a great map and sense of progression, intense and rewarding cop chases, and an all-time great soundtrack; I didn‚Äôt think anything could ever top it‚Ä¶until I played Forza Horizon 4.

I haven‚Äôt had any direct experience with this franchise until this game. I played quite a bit of the spiritual predecessor to Forza Motorsport, Project Gotham Racing, back on the Xbox, but that‚Äôs where my experience with Forza started and ended prior to FH4. And wow, what a first impression this franchise has made on me. There are so many things that I love about this game:

- It has an absolutely staggering amount of content. 145 hours is what it took me to get all the achievements throughout the base game and expansions, and there was still plenty of races to do, plenty of cars to unlock, lots of online content to engage in, and I only really experienced one full festival series. Each activity in the game has a separate progression tracker which lets you know what there is to unlock if you keep playing or complete a specific mission with a higher score, which is really helpful when deciding what you want to work towards.

- Handling and difficulty is highly customizable. You can turn on and off assists to your liking, and pretty much every car has access to a large variety of parts and a highly in-depth tuning menu to give you complete freedom over how you want your car to feel. There‚Äôs a plentiful number of AI difficulty settings too; I settled on the highly skilled setting as the cars always kept up to a good degree without feeling like they were guaranteed to pass me as high rubber-banding usually results in. Higher difficulty settings usually have at least AI car ahead of the pack that is rather annoying to catch up to even with well-timed laps, though you are forced to experience the highest difficulty AI in the weekly trial races, and in these settings, they are incredibly fun if you have a group that knows what they‚Äôre doing.

- The setting of Great Britain was not something I expected to see in a major racing game like this, but I was really glad to see how well they executed it. Maybe I‚Äôm a bit biased, but the buildings, landmarks, country drives, the city of Edinburgh; they all feel perfectly translated from the real-world into a more condensed setting. I also quite appreciated the car culture that was explored in some of the more structured Horizon story missions, as the country has quite an extensive history of car manufacturing.

- The tone of this game is infectiously positive; it genuinely feels impossible to feel negative emotions while playing it. Even when losing, I was always having so much fun that it never bothered me. This means it can act as a comfort game, something I could always imagine playing no matter how I‚Äôm feeling. Also, the soundtrack has plenty of great tunes, from rock to rap, drum and bass to classical; as someone who loves a diverse range of music, it‚Äôs lovely to see a modern racing game with so many great tunes.

- The level of freedom this game provides is unlike anything I‚Äôve ever seen. Hundreds of car options, dozens upon dozens of races and missions, and you‚Äôre not directed to do anything in particular as there are very little restrictions put in your way. In most cases, you can attempt most races with any car you choose, and the difficulty comes from the AI choosing cars that are of the same performance class to you, so it never feels like you‚Äôve won the game by getting a supercar as a reward. The only real goal the game mentions is to reach superstar status at like Level 150, and how you get to that point is entirely up to you once you complete the opening few hours.

Forza Horizon 4 became one of my most played games on Steam and one of my favourite games ever made in a matter of months. It is a truly best-in-industry example of arcade racing, and reflects a development cycle of games which has been iterated and improved upon for over a decade by this game‚Äôs initial release. Any complaints I could make are grasping at straws, though I will say that the game is quite pricey for a three-year old release which has just received a new entry. Save yourself some money and pickup the premium edition on a sale; if you like arcade racing, I can almost guarantee you will love this game. And the fact that there will be entries past this suggests to me this series is only going to raise the bar even higher than it already has for years to come. 10/10.",1
675,"TLDR: DO NOT BUY IF YOU HAVE A WHEEL.

Absolutely terrible. I write negative reviews almost never, but wow this game is bad. I didn't spend $80 to play a racing game on my keyboard of course...I have a Logitech G920, probably the most common wheel out there. It is utterly amazing how they could make it feel so bad to play with one. Of course without tuning any wheel settings it's literally unplayable, but even after watching a few guides and testing out other people's settings, it still felt so so bad. I have a good amount of hours in Assetto Corsa, and that game knows how to make a wheel feel. I don't care if this game is supposed to be ""arcadey"" or whatever other excuses people give it, the whole point of having a wheel is to make it feel decently real, or at least playable. I just cannot even describe how bad it feels. Going left and right just a little bit gives almost 0 force feedback and is super floaty, then if you turn more than 30-40 degrees, it starts giving an insane amount of force feedback. You can't make any snappy turns like weaving out of your lane to pass a vehicle quickly, without completely losing control. Really hard to describe, but if you've played any actual driving games, avoid this. But if you paid $80 to play a racing game with a keyboard or controller, go for it, I'm sure the game will be fine.

Also another note on transmissions. Holy fuck. So I'm driving my Ford Focus RS using my clutch and shifter, and then for one mission I switch to a Bugatti. Like the very VERY least they could do was automatically switch me to my paddle shifters on my wheel. But no, I have to drive the Bugatti using a clutch and gearshift. Talk about immersion. Do I really need to go into the settings and change the way I shift the car for each different car I drive? Mind blowing to me. Like I get this isn't 100% ultra realistic simulation, but geez shifting the car the way it shifts in real life doesn't seem like much to ask for. This game would probably give a Tesla a manual gearbox ffs.

Definitely avoid this game unless you are insanely casual and/or have never driven a car in real life.",0

680,"I don't recommend this game for many reasons. The biggest one is all the bugs and problems it has, I just don't see how coming from one store to another can be such a big mess like this. Oh, and even though you link your microsoft account to your steam account, the game doesn't even use steam friends to invite in game. You have to download bunches of bloat apps from the microsoft store and enable xbox game bar just to invite friends into your group in the game.

I spent twelve hours last weekend to figure out why my game crashes after the first autumn race only to figure out that having the ethernet adapter disabled was the issue(and for others on the steam discussions having bluetooth disabled causes crashes too). I had it disabled because I don't have access to ethernet anyway, but apparently this game doesn't like it disabled. Nowhere on the official faq mentions this, so I guess I solved a bug that, according to google searches, has been around for three years and no one knew a fix.

Another problem that's been brought up again and again is the price and I definitely agree with them. Had I not had a hunger for a big budget triple-A racer I wouldn't have paid this horrible price for a three year old game neither, and a few times so far in the game there's unskippable videos advertising dlcs as if this is a free to play game.

Last problem is one I have only heard about when the game was locked onto the microsoft store; the devs or some body is ban-happy when it comes to some paint jobs you put on cars, unsure if this is still 1 nowadays.

Overall I'm having some fun, but it shouldn't be worth this price and shouldn't be this bug-filled mess with the steam discussions still trying to solve all the issues. Wait till it's cheaper and see if the devs do something about all the problems reported.

07.07.21 UPDATE:   After 60 days, the game is still kinda unplayable. AI drivers shortcuts checkpoints and never go back, AI drivers hits you and you'll get out of the road and press ""R"" and see yourself flying. Then you have to press ""R"" again and see yourself right before you fly. Then press ""R"" again and also you'll see yourself right before you start flying due to the collision. After 3-4 ""R""s, if the game wants you to get back to road it'll spawn you just before the AI hits you and you'll start flying again and you'll probably lose the race cause of these idiotic bugs and systems.. 
Also you still can't play Online Adventure cause it takes 30 mins min. to find a game but either you'll never connect or you can't even pick your car and get disqualified... GJ.. yet they are releasing a 5th game... Such a nice and sweet company.",0

715,"The racing parts of Forza Horizon continue to be amazing. The amount of accessibility sliders means someone like me - I'm legally blind with some vision left in one eye - can race and rewind when necessary.

That's why it's so frustrating at times when the game forces you into races that aren't so visually accessible, or that rely on rubber banding mechanics in the showcases to ensure a close victory or loss. Racing down a highway into oncoming traffic with a car that can take only one hit (as in at least one stunt driver race) before the race restarts at the beginning really saps the fun out of an otherwise cheerfully accessible game. The menus are also a cluttered mess, but thankfully the game works really well with a magnifier when you need to use the menus.

The cars here are fine, though there are pretty big gaps in makes and models. I know it's not going to be on par with Forza proper as far as that selection is concerned, but this series feels more and more like a grab bag of random licenses. That said, traversing England in anything but winter is fun and the overall gameplay is still the best of its kind. Really looking forward to 5.",1

719,"I'm honestly on the fence on if I would recommend this game or not, but since I think the game is overrated, I will try to bring balance to the ratings with a no. This game is absolutely beautiful when it comes to the graphics, runs insanely smooth, especially for a racing game, and gives you access to so many cars. I also enjoy that it is a racing game that's ""street"" but also doesn't have police as a challenge. The positives are already gone. So, with that being said, it's pretty dry other than that. I really hate the fact that the DLC feels thrown into your face. There are lot of cosmetic things I dislike about the game, like the fact that player names are used when racing against NPC's. This game feels like it's meant for non-gamers or light gamers that just want to race a bit, but also has a pretty complicated interface for someone who doesn't game much, so I'm not sure who the exact audience even is. I have had a hard time trying to find a racing game that fits what I'm looking for in a racing game, and this one certainly isn't it. I dislike that cars are so easy to obtain, with no real challenge to unlock any cars or earn money. The story is uninteresting, some races feel like a bad movie, with no way to lose. The rewind button is a pretty fun and unique feature, but really takes the soul out of racing, but why wouldn't you use it? Lots of things to collect, the spinwheel is really terrible, almost feels like a lootbox. The driving controls are fine, and driving feels decent enough in the game, it is more on the realistic side (minus crashes). 

Seems like a good game if you aren't a heavy gamer and just want a pretty looking racing game with no real challenges.",0

In the end, it was not a bad decision to make. The game runs smoothly with the fact that it's still the best arcade racing game ever existed. Though it seems a waste of time to restart all progress, the game is enjoyable and I'm ok with this. Unless you already have the Microsoft version, I think it's definitely worth the price.

I think Lego Valley was creative like Hot wheels but it wasn't executed very well. Too many pointless missions for full completion made it really dry.
On the other hand, there is only 1 things that I absolutely can't stand. The download system. Since it requires almost 30 thousand downloads for a design, photo, or tune to become popular, some of the nicest liveries, photos, tunes, and blueprints that have ever graced forza with their presence, never even get seen.

747,"[h1][b][u]Stay away from this version of Forza Horizon 4.[/u][/b][/h1]
After two years of being locked behind the terrible windows store, Forza Horizon 4 finally arrives on a platform that actually works; however, there's a catch. For some ungodly reason, this port is an absolute mess and here's why.
[list]
[*]The game has a massive problem with stuttering during the free roam section. It occurs randomly and even the transitions to other sections of the game like entering a race suffer from immense stutters. The patch notes state that these issues have been dealt with however that does not seem to be the case considering my and other peoples experiences with the game.
[*]The game crashes quite frequently and the Microsoft has done bugger all to help. Their advice requires the users to jump through hoops and spend hours tinkering with something that should already be working in the first place.
[*]The pricing is completely unreasonable. The windows store release is the better version and it's on sale more frequently. The game is over two years old and is plagued by major issues yet Microsoft has the gall to charge 70 ‚Ç¨ for it.
[/list]
[b]I'd also like to clarify that your hardware is not the cause of these issues and I'm basing it off of two things.[/b]
[olist]
[*]I've played the game on the windows store and on an XBOX ONE S and these issues are not present at all. Forza 4 on the windows store runs completely fine, only the steam version has these issues. If the problem was my low-end hardware, then the issues would also be present in the windows store version.
[*]Other players far exceeding my own hardware (GTX-1060, i5 3570k, ddr3 1600mhz) have experienced the same issues and I'll link the proof below. If these issues were caused by insufficient hardware, then these players would not experience the same issues.
[/olist]
Based on this, only the steam version has these issues and regardless of what hardware you posses, these issues will appear. A players hardware is not the cause of these issues, period.

In summary, this steam port of Forza Horizon 4 is absolutely terrible and I'd advise anyone to avoid buying the steam version of the game. It's a darn shame since Forza Horizon 4 is the only game I've really enjoyed from the racing genre and to see Microsoft haphazardly release a port of this quality is incredibly disappointing.

But then it was nearly impossible to drive.  Just barely touching the wheel caused the car to go to the most extreme direction.    The animations inside the car showed the same issue.  Also force feedback would stop working anytime I switched out of the game. 

It's crazy to me that small games like American Truck Simulator work with the wheel/pedal controls and FFB with 0 modification, but a huge company like Microsoft is unable to provide proper support.

After 3+ hours of debugging, I had to request a refund",0

768,"you may get the impression that I consider Forza Horizon 4 to be the perfect game... And guess what?  It's almost like that.  Sure, you can complain about the lack of revolutionary changes here, you can complain about the price (if you play on one platform), but at the end of the day it's a really great game.  And unless you have a particular aversion to cars - arcade, it's hard to point out a bigger mistake. There is also no doubt that in its category Forza Horizon 4 outclasses all competition.  There is absolutely everything you could wish for in racing here.  I have an irresistible impression that after this game it will be very difficult to come up with something else to create another, better Forze Horizon.

 Finally, it remains to ask the final question - is it worth buying Forza Horizon 4?  Hmm, after all you've read, I think you already know what the answer will be",1

There are some major bugs to be wary of, such as:

1. Crashing issues. Program was crashing on certain stages and areas for no good reason, and the common guidelines online did not help. Ended up checking the integrity of game files on the Steam settings and it solved the issue. Not sure if it will work on everyone else's crashing problems so good luck.
2. Online race ranking is catastrophically broken. I can win 5~10 consecutive ranked modes but not get the points/rank ups due to some people quitting/disconnecting, but 1 loss and then my rank just plummets. This particular bug has been around for years so... devs do not care at this point. What a shame.

All in all a decent game for car lovers with enough number of players being active atm, but there are lots that should have been fixed by the devs. Both the major problems above and quite some minor adjustments could have improved the game massively (like permanent ""ghost mode"" for online races to prevent players ramming deliberately in order to win, fixes on some visual body areas for car vinyl application, and so on)

Pros:
Racing is realistic but also fun
Lots of cars to choose from
Plenty of activities to keep you busy
Beautiful graphics
Good controls and customization of cars

Cons:
Lottery wheels
Said lottery wheels are filled to the brim with cosmetic clothes/dances/car horns which makes getting a car and spending money far more rare than it should.
All this stuff for an avatar that you only see during annoying cutscenes before and after races that you cannot even customize, you have to choose one from a generic group of like 10 shitty character models
SO. MANY. CUTSCENES.
Just in general too much dialogue, you literally will get interrupted almost every time you open your map by unskippable dialogue that is just so fucking obnoxious.

Overall great game but it can be annoying with all the extra non racing bullshit they added. But other than those glaring issues its pretty dang fun and the DLC is good

823,GAME KEEPS CRASHING!!!!!!,0
824,"I bought this game during a sale at the beginning of 2021 and I played the intro, about 4 regular seasons and 4 of the ""best of"" seasons (before FH5's release). So I'm not a veteran but I do have some playtime under my belt.

FH4 is a racing game with mechanics somewhere in between simulation and arcade. Its definitely not iRacing or a F1 game but its also not Need for Speed. There are dozens of assists to adapt to your driving style (TC, SC, ABS, manual or auto shifting, tire wear, different steering settings, ...) but I do recommended you learn to drive with atleast TC and SC off and in manual gear, as that will be the easiest way to actually win races; even against the hardest AI opponents (called drivatars). A steering wheel is definitely not necessary or recommended, but atleast a controller is advised.

Racing is done in cars and this game has a metric fuckton of those, well over 700 (I know that‚Äôs not a ton, but whatever), in well over 30 categories (hypercar, supercar, retro muscle, modern muscle, rally, SUV, etc ‚Ä¶) Most of those cars are actually still obtainable through the regular ingame shop and wheelspins (which is an ingame reward each time you level up). Others are locked behind Festival rewards, but we‚Äôll get to that. Cars all look really gorgeous and well modelled ‚Äì including the interior - especially for a 3 year old game. Unfortunately they lack in the sound department. Most sounds are really bland, to low, to high or just plain bad. On top of that, there are only a handfull of different engine sounds, so a Golf GTI might sound exactly the same as a Ferrari FXX; depending on the upgrades. 

Talking about upgrades, cars come in 7 classes: D (the lowest), C, B, A, S1, S2 and X (the highest). You can install various upgrades to increase ‚Äì or decrease ‚Äì the rating and class of a car. The upgrade system is a world of its own, because each upgrade also unlocks customization in terms of gear length, tire pressure, downforce, ‚Ä¶ so you might you just want to download prebuilt ‚Äòtunes‚Äô from other people. Most tunes have some description in what its good at (racing, rally, grip, speed, ‚Ä¶). Another tip: the class a car comes in is usually the best class for that car, give or take one or two. So a D-class car is probably the most fun in D or C-class, maybe B-class but that‚Äôs usually it. When looking for tunes, the most popular ones are always ‚Äòmax tunes‚Äô that bump the car somewhere into S2, but you‚Äôll quickly learn that isn‚Äôt fun nor competitive. So in 99% of the cases, you can ignore those and go for the sensible option.

Racing is done in several disciplines: race (closed circuits), street (mixed with AI traffic), rally, cross-country (literally) and some minor drag racing. Each to his own but I had the most fun with race and rally. Street is really random because of AI spawns and cross-country is super arcade and over the top. There are over a 100 events across all of these categories, so there is definitely plenty to do. Each win will not only reward you with credits and level up your character but also increases your level in that specific discipline, with a ‚ÄòMajor Race‚Äô unlocking at a certain point for every discipline. Each with a ominous name such as Titan, Colossus, Gauntlet and Goliath (the DLC‚Äôs also have these types). These are by far the most fun races in the endgame portion. On top of that there are also a bunch of side-activities such as drifting, showcase events, jumps and speedcamera‚Äôs/zones (these last 2 are called PR Stunts). There is also a skill system that grants points when you perform drifts, jumps, drive fast or nearly crash. This skill system is absolutely horrendous unfortunately.

‚ÄòEndgame‚Äô occurs after the first 4 seasons. And with seasons I mean actual seasons as in Spring, Summer, Autumn and Winter. Its advised you try to finish that as soon as possible as to unlock the Festival Playlist. Each playlist is a monthly event spread over the 4 seasons (one for each week) with different challenges for each. The gameplay loop is always pretty much the same though: take a picture, complete 3 PR stunts, 3 cups consisting of 3 races each, an online race called The Trial, a playground game (which is by far the worst thing about the playlist) and a set of Forzathon challenges. Forzathon challenges also occur outside of this mode and grant you points that you can spend in a separate ingame store. Completing a season for 50% and 80% grants a reward (usually a car or a Backstage Pass, which is a exclusive car shop) and the same applies for the entire Festival. 

Before we get to multiplayer: most exclusive or ‚Äòmeta‚Äô cars are usually Festival rewards and that sort of forces you to complete the season each and every week. It‚Äôll take you about 3 hours of your time to finish it up (if you skip the toxicity that is Playground Games) and while that isn‚Äôt much for a single week it gets boring after a while. I‚Äôve played 8 ‚ÄòFestivals‚Äô (so 32 seasons)  and its always the same loop over and over and over. PR Stunts are cheesed using the Ferrari 599XX (which should be your first Backstage Pass buy). The races are just rehashes of an existing events but with a different car restriction (the only good thing, forcing you to atleast use different cars). After 3 cycles I pretty much knew each race before it even began. Considering the size of the map (500+ roads), this is a missed opportunity to atleast generate some dynamic races or do something new.

There are also some other modes that the game tries to force on you, such as Super 7 (complete challenges made by other people), the Eliminator (a BR) and probably something else I‚Äôm forgetting. Suffice to say these are very niche modes and usually not fun. Then there are Horizon Stories which are different stories or careers but boil down to racing somewhere (and not following the GPS because its not the fastest route), perform a PR Stunt or gathering skill points. I could write an entire essay about how bad these ‚Äòstories‚Äô are but I‚Äôll just stop here and keep wondering why the hell they keep this bullshit in these games (including in FH5). So just skip them and thank me later.

I‚Äôve played a bit of multiplayer but it suffers from the same ilness as every other racing game: rammers/trollers (even in teammodes where you race against drivatars) or retired pro-racers in a simrig. The game tries to work around each problem by ghosting your car if there is an accident incoming and by using rank tiers, so in most instances its not as bad as I make it seem. There is a bit of meta going on in the top-ranks, but usually you can drive whatever suits you most for that class. The online racing is never really highlighted as much (apart from a monthly Festival challenge) but definitely give it a shot. Stay away from Playground though.

A final note on the DLC‚Äôs if you plan to buy the Ultimate edition. Treasure Island is more of the same with a heavier focus on Rally, so if you like that it‚Äôs definitely a solid expansion. You‚Äôre also showered in money by finding the Treasures, so if you struggle to buy all the houses in the mainland, that should help you. The Lego expansion is also fun, mostly because of the map being different Lego themes and it including the only actual circuit in the game.

FH5 is at the horizon (no pun intended) so paying full price for this game is absolutely ridiculous, so pick it up only when heavily discounted. The game will still be supported somewhere into FH5's lifecycle so if you can get it at a nice price, it's definitely worth it considering how much there is to do. The DLC‚Äôs are also fun additions to the game and if you‚Äôre into the Festival gameplay loop, you have A LOT of hours of racing ahead of you.",1
825,"Piece of garbage from Microsoft. Not only you can't change the in-game weather, also the game will show you ads that are unskippable. And I'm not even mentioning the dumb-ass AI.",0
826,"Jika anda suka game balapan yang menyenangkan, namun jiwa kompetitif anda ingin tertantang. Forza Horizon 4(FH4) jawabannya. Ini adalah Forza Horizon pertama saya dan saya langsung cocok dengan gameplay nya. Feel tiap mobil bisa sangat berbeda membuat kita harus menguasainya jika ingin memenangkan event balapan.

Konten yang ditawarkan begitu beragam. Setiap minggu ada pergantian musim dan event yang dihadirkan juga berbeda. Sulit untuk merasa bosan di game ini. Selain itu ada 2 tambahan konten DLC jika anda beli yang versi ultimate.

Belum lagi grafiknya. Saya sudah lama nggak main game balapan yang kualitas grafiknya sebagus ini. Hal itu membuat betah untuk berlama-lama di Photo Mode yang ada di FH4. Filter foto yang ada di Photo Mode juga cukup lengkap yang bisa membuat game ini cocok jika judulnya diganti Automotive Photographer Simulator Horizon 4.

Untuk Online Mupltiplayer ada berbagai mode. Favorit saya adalah The Eliminator, semacam battle royale tapi dengan mobil. Yang sedikit mengganjal adalah di mode Online Adventure yang terdiri dari Team Adventure, Free for all, Drift. Waktu tunggu loading screen di semua Online Adventure termasuk lama. Bisa sampai 10 menit hanya di loading screen. Entah itu masalah server atau koneksi.

Meskipun begitu, semua hal diatas membuat saya nggak ragu untuk preorder Forza Horizon 5 Ultimate Edition.",1

Edit: With the release of Forza 5 most of the racers have moved over - However...Forza Horizon 4 will always be the benchmark of the Horizon series with is huge open world set in the British countryside with stunning views and captivating roads - A very long list of cars and customization options ranging from Forza curated livery & tunings to Community curated content available for the car of your choice - The story lines are rich with car and motorsport history, and the content is lovingly overwhelming that will keep you playing for some time  - the game is still just a blast to play.

There is still so much to do on Forza Horizon 4 - This game is worth its weight in gold, and getting it on a special is more than worth it!",1

832,"My first 10 or so hours were spent in 720p with the lowest settings with often stutters. However, with the recent update, i can play the game on 1080p with little to no stutters (and those were in multiplayer, which i only play with friends). 

Pros:
Very big car list, rivaling Gran Turismo

A lot of meme cars, like the Peel P50, a whole fucking tractor, the BMW Isetta and of course, the Reliant Supervan

A LOT of community made tunes and wraps, perfect for any player

Probably the only game I've played where you can do burnouts with the front wheels

A variety of events, like dirt racing, street racing, sprints, circuits and drag

Amazing graphics, even on the medium setting

Grindfest that you can enjoy, (check the 5th pro)

The houses you can buy range from an ordinary bungalow to an entire freakin castle

It is VERY well optimised, running on my ryzen 3 2nd gen apu without no problems (as of recent patch)

Fun dlc, like the lego dlc and fortune island

Cons:
If you're a fan of commie cars like the Lada or Trabant, prepare to be dissapointed.

The map could get boring at times

While there are a lot of cars, only around 20 of them are widely used, one quick example is that a lot of people only drive jdm cars, while like 3 or 4 people drive something like the vauxhall corsa

LONG LOADING TIMESSS, this is however due to the game optimizing itself for your pc

As of the time of writing this, FH4 will be less and less updated due to the dev team focusing on FH5

Some dlc isn't worth to buy, like the welcome pack (literally gives you money, a house and some cars,) the VIP dlc which is the same as the welcome pack, and by far the most stupid dlc, the treasure map, it just reveals the location of the barn finds which take literally around a minute and 30 seconds to find.

the ""customization"" is a joke. don't expect nfs or midnight club tier of customization, its just there to exist

Overall this game is a banger, I bought it on sale and while it didn't run very well on my hardware, i still had lots of fun with the game (and now with this patch i can enjoy the game in full 1080p glory with basically no problems)

First thing you will think after starting this game is [b] WOW! The Graphics are Beautiful. [/b] And the Cars handling feels pretty realistic depend on your simulation settings according to your controller, Free roam has so much to offer in a very big open world map. It's not NFS Like experience, There are no cops the whole world is full of fast cars you just drive around and do the different racing events.

[b] Pros [/b]
[list]
    [*]The Best Graphic you can see in a racing game
    [*]Dynamic seasons - Spring, Summer, Autumn, Fall, Winter. And driving feels different in every season
    [*]Realistic Driving (can be changed via in game driving simulation settings according to your controller)
    [*]Optimised AF 
    [*]Online Experience is pretty huge
    [*]Beautiful UK location
    [*]Customised designs available for every car, you can download any pre made by community or make your own
    [*]You can drive [b]Hoonigan Gymkhana Ford focus [/b]
[/list]

[b] Cons [/b]
[list]
    [*]Graphics looks insane in Day time but in the night time they looks kinda dull because of the average lighting effects. 
    [*]Online Servers are XBox Live Servers so you may experience lag in online mode cause the latency is 200+
    [*]You have to watch Some unskippable ads of DLCs randomly in the game
    [*]You can drive any car anytime. unlike NFS where you start with slower cars and then progress to hyper cars, in this game you can literally drive any car any time you want so there is no thrill of unlocking fast cars as you progress through game.
    [*]Driving can be challenging with Keyboard, some cars are impossible to drive with keyboard, But you can turn on different assistance options in simulation options and you can enjoy the game with keyboard but its better with a controller or Wheel.

849,Having a ton of fun in this game!,1
850,"For those who wants to buy this game, i have things to say:
This game is an absolute beast, no matter what problem behind that, but for people that demands more, i will consider you to wait OR maybe wait for the next Forza Horizon 5. This game runs well and gives a good graphic. A lot of cars (if you have the DLCs) and still many more features that this game has.

I have this game on the Microsoft Store, and more than 300+ hours playtime, and i am starting a new journey in this Steam Version. Enough talk, and i will give you some pros and cons about the Steam Version:

PROS:
(+) Cheaper than the Microsoft Store's one.
(+) Really good graphics (if you have a good PCs or laptop).
(+) Many people complain about the car's sound, but they are good nonetheless.

CONS:
(-) Stability is something to be reconsider if you wanna buy this game.
(-) Lag and some fps stuttering still happening (I have no idea, but hopefully they will not abandon this after the FH5).
(-) No cross save file over XBOX (Microsoft Store) and Steam, so if you previously played on XBOX (Microsoft Store), you can't bring your progress to the Steam version.

CONC:
Besides the lacks of stability, i still enjoy this game. I hope, before FH5 actually release, Playground Games still giving some stability fix and stuttering fix into this Steam version. And for you guys who wants this game, i would suggest you guys to buy. It's a good game anyway.

P.S:
This is my only opinion. A lot of people may agree or disagree with my opinion. Thanks and have a great day!",1

Now to MY problems:
Microsoft has a lot of problems with this game. Starting from connection issues to frequent crashes and lags after races. Now that microsoft also released the game on steam, it just proved me the point, that they legit don't give a f*ck about crashes or anything. Releasing new content (cars etc.) left right and center and now release on steam is just the cherry on top to approve the point that microsoft is trying to milk this cow to the very last drop.
Another point, I can't play with my friend who bought this game microsoft store or atleast it doesn't work properly trough the xbox companion app (Which btw sucks major ass).
I bought this game on steam, because first of all my progression got completly reset (Hacker hacked into E-Mail and fu*ked up everything) and because it was on sale.

For some reason this game works on my laptop but not on my desktop. There has been a lot of cases of people having problems with this game like random crashes or in my case, the game not launching at all on my desktop. Both my desktop and laptop are above the recommended specs and other games work flawlessly. Your mileage may vary.

[b]TLDR: Yes go buy it.[/b]

One of the best open world arcade racing games out there and Microsoft somewhat did the right thing of making the game available on Steam. Although the price is quite high for a few year old game. Physics are pretty good for an arcade racing game and the graphics are phenomenal.

[b]How does it compare to other games?[/b]
Well it's way better than The Crew for sure. This game is basically all the good parts from Need for Speed and The Crew combined. Need for Speed definitely has more customizations than this game. But the open world here takes place in Britain and is definitely very good looking and lively. For some reason The Crew's open world feels depressing. 

Most fun part of this game is the insane winnings you can get from doing the Spin the Wheels.

933,"Well after nearly 9 hours on the steam version of Forza, i can happily say its a great experience. Ive encountered no crashes at all, and no failure to start the game like some people are reporting. I think its worth noting that this game will ONLY run on a proper version of windows. Not LTSC, not what ever ""performance"" edition you found on youtube, and it sure as hell wont run on Windows 7. It has to be the official build of Home or Pro, and up to date. Home N and Pro N versions of windows will need media compatibility packs and windows media player adding for this game to run.

There is one or two minor bugs that ive come across, but absolutely nothing game breaking. When crossing the finish line, a small cut scene plays of your car and that can be slightly jerky. At the end of a race, once again in a small cut scene your character walks back to their car, and that has been a bit janky at times.

Gameplay is 100% 60 FPS constantly on ultra on a RX580 8GB with a 2700X processor, 32GB of ram and the game running on an SSD. Absolutely no issues there what so ever.

Now on to the elephant in the room. Having to start again. I must have over 2000 hours on the Windows Store version of this game, and i honestly didnt mind starting again. Im using cars ive never used before, in different configurations. Within the first hour, i'd already made 1,000,000 credits. This is not a difficult game to earn money on. I was personally happy to pay the asking price so i dont have to reinstall the game every time i reformat my windows drive, as i had to with the Windows Store version.

If you're new to the Forza franchise, and you are disappointed with the latest Need For Speed games, this is what you're looking for. Its an Open World, Team / Solo racing game with real cars and real names.

If i had to pick a drawback with this version, its the fact it still uses Teredo, for xbox compatibility. Its not a good networking solution and can often cause problems.

Overall 9/10

I guess if you play controller its fine but if you play with a force feed back wheel you will hate this game. I like the graphics and all, but since its a car driving game I would expect more realism from the steering inputs and also for the game to identify which car actually has a clutch and which one has a sequential gearbox rather than assuming they all are manuals with clutch",0

The lack of saving means that if you close out too early or the game freezes up, you can lose hours of work. I spent 2 hours free roaming to get roads and signs. I even did a race near the end to ensure that I had a save icon. The game didn't save. I've been changing audio settings in order to force a save but that's when the game decided to freeze up and I lost all the work I did. It's frustrating to put hours of work into a game just to lose it all because I can't create a save file. I recommend the game if you just want to drive around but not if you want to play through the story or are a completionist like me and spend hours exploring the map to collect everything. It's probably only saved about 75% of the time I've closed the game. But when you're playing for 2-3 hours at a time, that's a lot of progress to lose and be forced to do all over again.",0

951,"Buy on Xbox store.  At the moment the Steam version is plagued by constant random crashes and very long loading times on certain multiplayer races.  Sometimes the game will be fine for 4+ hours without issue, and then other times will crash after playing for 2 minutes.  This seems to be a common issue after reading up a bit.  
I will change this review if this gets fixed but for now I can not recommend paying top dollar for a 3 year old game that has these issues.",0
952,"after grinding the crap out of f4h and then letting off the gas, hitting the brakes, and coming back a few weeks in a row, i can't say i totally recommend the game. it was fun, free roam is still fun. but there's a lot left to be desired.

there's a lot of takes on voice acting, the ridiculous amount of badass cars just thrown at you, etc. etc.

my take is in driving. there are ai difficulties, as everyone knows. how i gauge them is:

expert if i want a challenging-yet-winnable one-shot.

pro if i want a very challenging-yet-winnable retry-spam.

unbeatable if i want a rewind-every-bad-corner-or-missed-chance-at-ramming-the-ai retry spam.

the massive, massive, undeniable, unrelenting, tormenting issue i have is that no matter what, every race, every time, you start 12/12. if you really want to race the best of the best the game has to offer in ai, you have to overcome an 11-spot deficit. every time. sounds like something you should easily be able to do, its ai right? but honestly it borders tedium with how you have to dissect your start, rewind not-perfect corners, etc. etc.

there should be qualifiers. pre-plotted best times to race against to pole or determine position. its hard to explain, but starting 12/12 every time is so disheartening.

beyond starting position...

i, personally, have a really hard time spotting checkpoints. i don't want to use rewind. i hate it. but i have to restart races so often because i genuinely have no fking idea where the next checkpoint is. races with ramps are the worst. i play with traction and stability off, like i genuinely try for the hardest difficulties i can. but hit a ramp with even like a seven degree angle and your car is probably going to end up facing backwards. restart race.

all that to say it isn't always the end of the world. like a lot can be user error. but it doesn't always feel right. sometimes it just feels like you couldn't do anything about it. press rewind. but, rewind like takes the piss out of arcade racing. i don't want to use it. but challenge yourself and it feels like you have to have it on or spend 20-60 minutes or more grinding a race.",0
953,very cool,1
954,A Masterpiece.,1
955,This is the best racing game I've ever played. For a while it used to be GTA V. The price is expensive but you are paying for 740+ name brand cars that actually exist in real life from multiple companies. Honestly I think this is worth it at full price but getting it on sale would be a bonus. The only thing I dislike about the game is the drifting. I think drifting is dumb.,1
956,"Here is my honest review. 

From my perspective, Forza Horizon 4 (FH4) is far more better than Need for Speed (NFS) which I stopped playing after a few hours of unbearable gameplay. The fact that FH4 has breathtaking graphics and scenes while the visual effects look terrible on NFS, though my medium-end pc can max out every piece of graphics. I heard you guys experienced crashes, they haven‚Äôt happened to me yet. 

PROS: 
- realistic gameplay as if you‚Äôre driving in real life
- smooth movement 
- has countless completely different side quests 
- the map is huge ( I guess it‚Äôs even bigger than GTA5‚Äôs)
- can buy more houses 

CONS:
- can‚Äôt destroy cars
- can‚Äôt turn off headlights 
- cars are somewhat partially customizable 
- trees, other random vehicles and houses are indestructible 
- There‚Äôs completely no physics in collisions among cars and other objects 
- can‚Äôt get out your cars
- maybe due to pc incompatibilities, you may experience some short laggy moments after completing a race. From time to time, mouse cursor disappears. 

To cut a long story short, Forza Horizon 4 is a highly-invested game, some people might find those cons annoying but plain as day, FH4 is just a racing game so that they are understandable and acceptable. Because of regional prices, I bought the game for $25 while other places, it cost an arm and a leg which is $80 so you should wait until it‚Äôs on sale or Steam will fix its regional pricing.

958,"Yes I did give this game a negative review when it first came on steam as I couldn't transfer my progress from xbox app to steam as the game doesn't support cross progression, but then I totally forgot how amazing this game was, so guess what I decided to play it all over again and yes I decided to go achievement hunting once again on steam. So I put a total on 122 hours at the time of this review (327 hours in total with xbox) with a perfect achievement game on both steam and xbox. And oh boy this game deserves it. It's a master piece, I have so much memories with it. Finally my verdict is this game deserves all my time no matter what. Although FH5 is out, but this one holds a special place in my heart.

968,"Its a good thing for Horizon that they have no competition against quality open world racing games because they sure make it hard to like this game. They have ignored many previous flaws from Horizon 3, have barely changed the game formula apart from the addition of seasons, and doubled down on cringe inducing Fortnite gimmicks.

Pros:

- Looks incredible
- Cars feel weighty and are fun to drive
- Seasons mix up the landscape which is nice 

Cons:

- Wheelspins constantly giving you free cars every 15 mins killing any sense of progression and cluttering your garage so you feel compelled to use them rather than buying cars you actually like 
- The inability to straight up sell cars from your garage, instead forcing you to go through the time consuming process of putting each car on the auction house with no guarantee of it being bought so you have to try again later or give the car away for nothing
- The game interrupts you after every single event you do to tell you about a new map marker or even to run a 2 min video advertising the DLC, and you cant skip it! In doing so they guaranteed I'll never buy their extra content for how obtrusively they market this. Just leave us alone to enjoy playing the game ffs.
- Far too many menus results in not knowing where to find certain things. Is it in one of the 20 sub tabs? At the Festival site? My home? Who knows?!!
- At the start of races it takes a few seconds for your HUD to appear so you can't see if you're over revving and getting too much wheel spin off the line as the tachometer isn't visible.
- Fortnite gimmicks are more in your face this time. Your character does stupid dancing emotes at viewpoints on the map and guess what? You cant turn them off!
- Had to change my review to not recommended because the game keeps crashing when entering my house and getting stuck in a loading screen advertising the DLC forcing me to reboot the game. This happens every play session.

So yeah, its fun at times but highly irritating. Hard to recommend overall despite the driving being fun and great visuals, because its basically a lazy re-skin feature wise of Horizon 3, and half the time the game crashes, the other half you have to wait for some annoying NPC to shut up before you can actually play the damn game.",0

989,"[h1]Summary[/h1]
Forza Horizon 4 is the right game for people who want to race and do fun things with cars in an open world. The main selling point of this game is the plentiful choice of realistic and detailed cars, beautiful and vast open world to explore, and many activities to do with the cars. Forza Horizon 4 is somewhat of a life-service game with new championships and missions for every season, but this game received its final update not long ago to allow the devs to fully focus on Forza Horizon 5. There are many things to do in this game and it's guaranteed going to keep you occupied for many hours. Sound of cars feels quite generic given the fact that many cars share the same sound, while music and other SFX is decent. Driving mechanics is pretty arcade as racing games go, with car damage being visual(it is possible to make the game more realistic by changing the damage setting to physical) and handling is rather simple. For a game that is quite old and is to be replaced very soon, it's best to wait for a discount and snatch the ultimate edition.

[b] ‚òÖ Optimization of the Xbox controller is simply too good to be 1, after all, the son of the house, shoulder button vibration is really cool (only available in the Microsoft Store version). [/b]

[b] ‚òÖ The number of cars is outrageous, with a wide variety of cars, and the collection of cars is really cool.
The only ""semi-realistic racing game"" IP in the industry, neither as entertaining as Need for Speed (except for the ""Shift"" series) or Wild Ride, nor as realistic as Powerhouse, Speed Racer and Project Cars. ""FH combines the two genres in a very subtle way.[/b]


[b] ‚òÖ The switching of seasons is truly remarkable, with four different seasons with very different vehicle controls and map scenery.[/b]

[b] ‚òÖ  has some of the best graphics of any racing game.[/b]

[b] ‚òÖ The two large DLCs are the most component DLCs inside all the racing games I have played, especially the LEGO DLC; LEGO world, LEGO characters, LEGO vehicles, with separate missions, separate maps ...... is extremely playable, not even close to a real game; unlike Need for Speed, which only comes out with a large number of vehicles DLC, this is what you call real DLC; in a word, just buy it, it's absolutely not a loss, it's by far the most stunning DLC I've ever played.[/b]

[b] ‚òÖ The Microsoft Store version is god-optimized and runs easily and smoothly on dodgy machines.[/b]


[h1] Disadvantages. [/h1]

[b] ‚òÖ The map volume can only be described as moderate, not great.[/b]

[b] ‚òÖ  Microsoft's servers are simply crap, can barely get into online.[/b]

[b] ‚òÖ  The bombing of files is simply speechless, many people here are estimated to have been bombed files, go to the complaint may not be able to return.[/b]

[b] ‚òÖ  Modifications are a bit scarce, only a few kits can be altered[/b]

[b] ‚òÖ  Microsoft Store and Steam cannot synchronize archives.[/b]

[b] ‚òÖ  CG lag. This is a problem in the Microsoft Store, and it won't be fixed, and the Steam version is even worse.[/b]

[b] ‚òÖ Inability to modify someone's custom paint and tuning.[/b]

[b] ‚òÖ No worse sound in any racing game than ""FH4"", with severe repetition, even worse than ""FH""'s predecessor, a complete step backwards.[/b]

[b] ‚òÖ  No shoulder button vibration in the Steam version.[/b]

The Steam version suffers from severe frame drops and is over-optimized; however, it is still better than other racing games.",1

the game play is perfectly made yeah the driving is bit difficult for first time but after all its great thing, online mode is also a good stuff in the game even the eliminator mode is next level thing like we get the random cars and we had to do head to head and eliminate the other players in the shrinking world kind a new battle cars stuff. 

and why i don't include the music, game has already a good background music and even the radio stations are nice like i would like to suggest the timeless FM is really cool like old epic music and some remix musics of the well known artists are also good,

I contacted microsoft support for assistance, but they were only able to check networking issues and not in game issues as it was the steam version. I then contacted forza support, but they did not attempt to solve my problem telling me to contact steam and microsoft support. My friend then attempted to refund the game, and I bought the microsoft version of the game. 

Steam rejected the refund despite the fact the sole purpose of buying the game was to play online, and we could not find a solution to the IPSEC error. After starting the microsoft version of the game and getting the gold armband, I was immediately able to play with my friend in the convoy. 

I would strongly recommend getting the Microsoft store version of the game over the steam version. It has higher stability and the customer service worker I talked to seemed to actually care about my problem and attempt to solve it to his best ability.",0

+3 MONTHS OF INITIAL GAMEPLAY (GLADLY IN THE PAST):
While the game offers a ton of content, nice visuals, and a good driving model, one can not simply accept the atrocious stutters that ruin free-roaming and most of the races. I can forget about multiplayer till this is fixed...

As of 22th of May 2021 (game EXE version 1.468.304.0), no improvements have been made. It's kind of a tragicomedy that a game published by Microsoft cannot run properly on its own system.

A customer should be warned by game-breaking issues before he commits to purchase - Steam needs to enforce such policy because turning off the money tap is the most effective persuasion on indolent sellers/developers.",1

And that's also why I'm leaving this negative review. People seem to be too cowardly to do so and are ""just happy the game is on Steam"", but bullshit must be called out.

Your save data from Xbox/MS Store cannot be imported even though other games like The Halo MCC support it. You're paying new game price for a game that tells you to fuck off if you bought it somewhere else. This is horribly anti-consumeristic and should definitely be called out.

Oh, but of course it forces a Microsoft account on you anyway, which as it is, is basically needless bloat.

Get your shit together Microsoft.

Edit: After playing the game for a couple hours, turns out it's not incomptence, it's maliciousness. The game still remembers all I did in my Xbox account, including the numbers of roads driven and such.

1044,Get more Forza games on steam,1
1045,Absolutely stunning visuals and amazing vehicles you can drive. I recommend getting the ultimate edition as it will ease the grind required to get high end cars and the overall price of the bundle is a steal.,1
1046,"Something about this is really.... Pale, thin, vanilla.
There's no heft, no crunch. The graphics are flawless.  And bland.  Medium contrast, medium value, medium meh.  The engine sounds are, well engine-y. And that's about it. The driving model? If you thump the gas it drifts a bit. Steer violently and it will wobble a bit. But, meh. The cars? They're all a bit different.
The tracks? They go left, right, there are elevation changes, but... Meh.
Every time you win a race a series of glossy screens flash info at you about all the something or others you've won, unlocked, whatever, Not rep amongst the hardcore street racers, or another sneering rival though. No. Comedy car horns or a tee shirt for your avatar. Yetch.
Collisions are entirely without consequence, even with damage turned up to simulation.  Everything from lampposts to dry stone walls (!?!?) can be driven through as though they have the solidity of a light mist.
And at the end of a race your competitors politely applaud and nod. Like yeah, you deserved it. It's all so unrelentingly blandly sort of .... nice. But nice like the doctor's upped your meds. As though everything is slightly distant, filtered through a pastel sunbeam.
There's no grit, no oil, no body. It's southern comfort and diet coke with an ice cube. Offending no-one but forgotten as soon as you put the glass down, Eventually, mid race, my eyes just drifted off the screen as I slowly realised I didn't care at all. Not frustrated, not beaten, just completely uninterested.

Alt-F4.

1047,"One of the best racing games I have ever played but I can't recommend buying this on steam. It constantly stutters while roaming and after 3 hours of playing it doesn't even launch anymore but instead keeps crashing in the loading screen, no solution to this either and even reinstalling the 90GB game doesn't help. Hopefuly I'll be able to recommend this game one day.
Edit: they actually fixed it, the games works as it did before, the only thing remaining is to fix stuttering
Edit 2: it's crashing again, this is not worth the time and patience
Edit 3: aside stuttering in free roam it's good and finally working",1

I don't need to share my thoughts about driving experience, everyone knows how good they are at this.

The graphics are outstanding, I fell in love with the beautiful landscapes and terrains of UK. Great game overall.",1

1060,"I hope anyone that is planning to buy this game reads this
this game is great, looks great, has great cars, but it doesn't steer great. whys that? you ask, well even when you have the simulation steering on (which is supposed to make the cars steer realistically) it will still under steer like crazy because when you go anywhere over 15 miles an hour you wont be able to steer fully. the car wont steer the full amount at the front wheels because it locks at a high speed up to like 25% of you steering. now i bet you can guess how that might make this game a little bit annoying to play. if you want your super cars to handle like fucking school buses then you have found your game.
fix your fucking game playground.",0
1061,you forget what reality is.,1

1066,BEst car racing game ever made <3,1
1067,One of the best racing game,1
1068,best racing game that i played,1
1069,"Well, how do I begin...
If your willing to spend some money you will recieve a open world game about cars with (still) quite good graphics and nice physics. Although the developers mostly dont give a flying fuck about their community and will throw a massive load of ads for their DLCs at you when youre playing it, this game is actually working (if you buy it on steam)... Some minor bugs are still there and will probably never be patched, but the game is fun. And thats how we come to the part why fh4 is actual an insanely good game: Its imo a perfect mix of arcade racing, car costumization, sim-like physics and open world. of course, to combine these aspects there must be compromises made in some way, but the mix of all of it came out great. The indirect storytelling which allows you to play freely and not be forced to play some heavily extended bullshit is pretty relaxing, it makes the game comfortable and always playable. The world design is pretty nice and detailed, even tho I hate england and its shitty weather, i think its beautiful. The sheer amount of cars is insane, customization possibilitys arent as overwhelming as in nfs titles, i miss some more detailed bodywork options and similar.
To sum it up: Nice game, minor bugs, a lot of fun time, still fairly high price


Edit: ok i am now about 107 hours in and update 1.476.404.2 was released i think just 2 days ago. The longer you play the game, the more you realize bugs that need to be patched, but aren¬¥t since like 2019. I already wrote that above but some things just get extremely annoying over time. GPU usage drops to 20-30% randomly which causes your fps to drop in some of the story missions. This doesnt only happen with some GTX 1660 but also with 3070 or higher. The wellknown server problems (randomly getting kicked because of ""conection problems"" while having 100 mb/s and more) and sometimes not beeing able to join friends can provoke some rages. Overall i still recommend buying this game, even some DLCs, but keep in mind: It¬¥s a microsoft game :)

Oh man, another edit: I'm now somenthing around 235 hours in the game and its surprisingly not getting as boring as i expected. Bought all the DLCs a month ago after not playing for a while and they are really fun. But theres one major problem that makes me wanna quit the game way to often: The lags. Although i have a fairly good internet connection, the game always tells me that it can't connect or has stupid amounts of lags. I run the game on 120 fps but still there are every few seconds some miliseconds of delay which make it kinda laggy and its just not running smooth. Ofc i tried singleplayer mode, after that didn't change anything i turned turned down my graphic settings heavily. But sadly that didn't fix it either...",1

There is a lot of random micro-stuttering, I played FH4 via the game pass from the Microsoft Store, and once you play on steam you can feel the difference.
Transitions between cinematic scenes and game play have different fps' so its extremely laggy during them cut scenes.
As I've previously mentioned, I've earned a lot of stuff in this game. Unfortunately as I logged into the Steam version of the game, I did not get access to all my previous hard earned progress. All the cars and forza credits that I earned are most likely overwritten  and I believe I'll have to start over again. 
The fact that Forza Developers are not allowing the migration of previous save/game data is something that is not at all fair to the entirety of the Forza Community . This should be a basic feature for any game that is available in multiple platforms.",0

Sometimes the game crash randomly.
Sometimes convoys bugged and crash.
Sometimes crash when you play with someone from Windows Store.

1110,"-Pros-
The racing in this game is solid.
Customisation is okay.

-Cons-
No progression what so ever, you can start with the best vehicles money can buy and don't feel you earn it, not to mention you can upgrade a low grade car to a supersport instantly with no progression of getting those upgrades.
You earn cars way to fast for my liking. 80% of my cars I don't even know anything about.
The game forces advertisements of their own DLC down your throat and you can't skip them :). It's forced adverts are more scummy than GTA V's constant phone calls of DLC that you don't own. You expect to pay for a game, you play the game but being forced to watch advertisements about crappy DLCs you couldn't give 2 fks about really sends home that it's not fun.
Matchmaking is terrible, hard to play with friends when servers screw up on you. You have to go through so many loops to try and get a good coop experience.


TL:DR Racing okay/Unskippable ads like a mobile game/bad matchmaking/terrible progression etc

If you want to pay for this game, wait for a good 75% off sale or close to that. But bare in mind, it won't feel like you own the game fully since you'll be haunted by unskippable ads for decades. 

60% racing, 40% ads.",0

1132,"I'll admit that this was my first racing game since 2006, but this might be the goddamn best racing game I've ever played. Forza Horizon 4 is the perfect blend of arcade and simulation racing, and is also one of the most accessible racing games out there. There is a flat out, *stupid* amount of stuff to do in the base game alone. Track racing, street racing, dirt-racing, off-road, drag strips. Tired of racing? There's plenty of ""stories"" and business quests you can do as well. All of this content is cleanly contained in a large and well-designed overworld where you can do everything at your own leisure. Driving the cars feels so good that my friends and I often just drive around the overworld while we talk about other things. You want to hear a bop? Tune the radio to Horizon Pulse, the first videogame radio station that only plays jams. Want to focus and be one with the speed? Turn the dial to Hospital Records. Want to set new drift records in a smoking car you just finished tuning and feel like a badass? It's time to pump out some beats from Block Party. Are you tired of taking everything seriously? Well there's a freaking classical station too. With 700+ cars, new ""seasonal"" events and challenges every week, the ability to tune your cars down to the level of your exact tire pressure, castor angle, and differential thresholds, and plenty of clothes, emotes, horns, and community-submitted paint jobs and tunes, you're bound to find excitement and joy in every corner of this game. Here are my criticisms. The net code for this game is jank, and the online model as a whole is confusing, thanks to Microsoft. I once waited 15 minutes to get into an unranked match. Never again. Two of my friends also seem to crash pretty frequently (the application not their car). My other criticism is that there are only six radio stations with no option for a custom radio station. And to add one more nitpick, the engine synth (the software generating the engine sounds) is kinda weak. So, to conclude, you should absolutely buy this game if you're on the edge. It runs extremely well on all tiers of hardware, glitches outside of online play are extremely rare, and it's a great time regardless of how you approach racing games. Peace out.",1

1149,"Amazing game, but getting multiplayer going is an absolute nightmare. Constant crashing in menus (game without multiplayer was completely stable for me at least), having to use Microsoft's garbage external app with no clear path to inviting others through steam. If I'm paying $70+ for a game I expect the multiplayer to just work. This needs to be patched before anyone should buy the game.",0
1150,"To be completely honest, I actually already own this game through the Microsoft Store, and have played the PC version (non-steam). I had uninstalled it some time ago due to all the issues with the game. While it plays fine during actual gameplay, the small but major issues that have absolutely NO answers on how the fix the game, or even proper updates from the developer, were enough for me to say ""Fuck this shit."" I swear I spent more time trying to get the game to not crash in simple menus or even upon start up of the game, than I did actually being able to play it. 

Which brings me to my present day situation. I saw the same was on Steam some time ago, but I wasn't about to pay $60 for a game I already own, even though yes I did pay the sale price of $40, but truthfully I wanted to see if the game was better to play through Steam, and is it?

Absolutely NOT.

I had played a bit early this morning when the game finished downloading, and while everything seemed fine for the first start up (not counting the fact that I had to re-sync my time and date in settings, in order to get the game to even launch). It was when I woke up and found that when I re-entered the game, upon pausing it would freeze then crash back to the Steam Library. And even when I tried to play the next race, it crashed then too, same situation. So I literally cannot even progress through the beginning 2nd stage of the game. I restarted NUMEROUS times, and even re-installed. It made no difference at all. I'm currently waiting for a refund, which I'm hoping I could get. 

But the summary of this review is basically, don't waste your money on this game. Microsoft clearly can't keep a 3-4 year old game up to date, and their customer support on these crashing issues is god-awful. Save your money, or wait until it dips down to a reasonable price. Because asking $60 for this game still, with all the crashing issues is absolutely absurd.",0

1155,See other comments about stuttering. It's especially bad during cutscenes with massive frame rate drops. I should have read the comment sections first and I wouldn't have purchased FH4. For some reason I have a feeling they have given up trying to fix it and we'll be stick with a broken port. Hope to get my money back. A real shame because it looks like a great game.,0

1157,"This is a weird game to review. The overall gameplay is pretty good, but the progression is extremely wonky due to the randomized prize system. There's little reason to ever load into a race with slow cars (even though the AI cars will be given cars of similar ""rank"", you still want to be the fastest car in the field), and only a handful of car categories are mandatory to use (mostly offroad vehicles), so you can legitimately just take one car, tune it to the max, and use it to clear the overwhelming majority of the single-player game. The side missions all force you into specific cars, and some of those are fun challenges, while others are miserable - missions with ""gotchas"" and tight time limits. They don't all tell you what the 3-star time limit is, forcing you to load back in, sit through the cutscene again, and try again. Which brings me to the real reason I have to mark this game as not recommended.

The loading times.

The loading times are freaking abysmal. I'm playing with this game on an SSD and the loading times are sometimes upwards of a minute. If you do missions or races in story mode, they're typically two minutes long or so. Between the loading times and the unskippable cutscenes, you're often spending more time sitting there doing nothing than playing the game. That's unforgiveable in a game like this.

And in multiplayer? Forget it. Multiplayer's even worse. There's a waiting period of a couple minutes to get things set up (which is understandable, people have to join the lobby/queue/whatever), then you have to wait for everyone to load in, then you have to wait for car selection, then you have to wait to load the track... there's multiple loading screens along the way and you legitimately sit there for about 5 minutes between races that last about 2 minutes. The developers really need to sit down with a pair of stopwatches, play the game, and time how much time they actually spend playing and how much time they spend sitting there staring at a screen that's doing nothing. 

It's astounding a game from a company as major as Microsoft is allowed to exist in this state. I'm not sure if this is exclusively a PC issue or if the Xbox version is the same way, but it's a travesty. This has all the makings of a good game, except you only spend about a third to a half of your time actually playing the game.

Don't get me started on the unskippable 30-second long ads for the DLCs.",0

- It still costs the same retail price as of the launch back in 2018
- Even when you sign in into your microsoft acc, the saves from xbox doesnt transfer to steam, so you need to play from start
- at the intro, the intro sound somehow gets muted and lots of other small bugs

* Constant stuttering and frame drops
* Stuttering and frame drops from 144 fps to 3 fps during loading cutscenes (dancing moron-o-tar)
* 100% guaranteed 1s delay after crossing the finish line
* 100% guaranteed 2-3s game stuck state every 10 mins of playtime. The game literally freezes and resumes causing you to crash your car in multiplayer races.
* Game stops detecting controller every 10 mins, basically the game thinks no controller is connected and ""soft"" disconnects the controller for 0.5s causing car crashes

The majority of these issues were not encountered before the 2 hour refund window. It takes 2 hours just to unlock all activities and to then realize the game performs like garbage.

[b]1 out of 10[/b]

If this review seems sparse and full of technical issues that is because the game is full of technical issues and not enjoyable.

I will gladly change my review to the actual game when these issues are completely fixed.

[b]UPDATE: April 14, 2021 -[/b]

* Fixed the stuck stuttering after crossing the finish line but all other problems remain including crashing

[b]UPDATE: April 20, 2021 -[/b]

* Fixed a lot of stuttering but introduced more frequent crashes.
* Also I figured out that the game pausing for 2-3 seconds every 10 mins happens if Windows Task Manager had EVER been opened before or during the game

[b]UPDATE: May 5, 2021-[/b]

* Lag after crossing the finish line has returned
* Random crashes increased in frequency
* The Magnate star card will not progress
* Ultimate Edition Crown Flair is still missing

[b]UPDATE: June 2, 2021-[/b]

* [strike]Lag after crossing the finish line[/strike] No more finish line lag
* [strike]Random crashes[/strike] Crashes seem to occur when servers are having issues
* No more stuttering, the only stuttering left is what you'll find in every game
* Loading scene stuttering still present but this is acceptable as it doesn't really affect gameplay
* The Magnate star card will not progress
* Ultimate Edition Crown Flair is still missing
* Rank does not update in Ranked Adventure if even 1 person leaves any race",0

1178,"This game is the reason that i don't go back to Need for Speed series. This game is pretty much like Grand Theft Auto V, but more cars oriented.

I got the Ultimate Edition just for 35 USD (399.000 IDR). And you basically got everything you want. So if you want to buy this game, just make sure you buy The Standard Edition with the Fortune Island DLC, LEGO Speed Champions DLC, and VIP Pack (VIP Pack helps you to gain 2xFP, Cr. and XP,  so it's your choice). The rest DLC is just to unlock the cars, which you can buy or unlock it later in the game. But if you can buy The Ultimate Edition, then go for it. Otherwise, The Standard Edition is enough. Then buy the maps DLC later. 

Pros :
-Open world racing game, big enough for you to explore.
-Huge number of cars (tractors ARE included).
-Decent driving physics (a sweet spot between arcade and simulation). It's playable using keyboard or controller. You can use steering wheel (mine is Logitech DFGT), but honestly i haven't found the best setting, it's just feel so wrong if you used to play Project CARS 2 on steering wheel.
-Graphics that makes you forget about real life.
-Eargasm sound car. But still can't beat the Codemasters sound designs.
-Lot of weekly content (and still updating).
-Photo mode, perfect for making your own wallpaper.

Cons:
-A long ass intro. The intro finish when you finish the year event (Autumn, Summer, Spring, Winter).
-Lot of object are destructible. It's not that bad, but it's feel road are useless in this game. You can even cut through woods.
-Micro stuttering, fps drop, freeze and CTD are still present after latest update (April 20th). And this problem is really the annoying one.",1

This game should be incredibly fun. And it would be, if it would just... let you drive. 

You spend far too much time in unskippable cutscenes, watching your bland millennial avatar smiling and waving. Then there's the unskippable dialogue, usually telling you how you unlocked another random thing in the game's unfathomable progression scheme. You should at least be able to drive while hearing this nonsense, right? No -- you have to sit there in the pause menu and listen to it. And just in case you missed everyone screaming in unison about this, the game has the sheer, unmitigated gall to randomly dump you into unskippable and painfully long ads for the game's various DLC packs.

1202,"Just awesome, I can tell from the little time I've played this game that I will have a blast for some time, the graphics are just, wow, it is very optimised! The gameplay is... okay, it's really just that there are a lot of cars, and you will have a lot of cars! (it ain't that big of a problem) 

Now, tuning the cars, you can do a lot with the tuning mechanics in the game, you can make a lambo a drift car, or a rally car, there are a lot of options for so many cars! But if you don't have time to mess around, there are other people's presets that you could choose on your car!

In conclusion! 
If you want a good game that's actually really fun, buy this game! I suggest waiting for some sales as it can get pricey! (if u want to have a good start, you can buy the ultimate pack, as it gives every DLC, there's a free one that you have to purchase separately! Don't worry it will stay free!)

1203,"This is the racing game Steam has been missing for years! As an arcade racing enthusiast since the days of Gran Turismo on the PlayStation and Sega Daytona in the arcade (and OutRun and Chase HQ even before that, but I don't want to date myself ;) ), this game fills the empty hole in my gaming life created by a lack of good racing games.

I tried getting into Wreckfest, but having been burnt by the early access and looooong development, plus the fact it's more simulation than arcade, it never really did it for me. There are the NFS entries on Steam, but EA...

So I waited and waiting. I even played the demo of Forza Horizon 4 on the Windows Games Store, but I'd rather burn my money than throw it away on that empty shell of an excuse for a digital pc games store.

And OMG, it was worth the wait. There is so much content here. And it's great, GREAT fun. There's so much to do. The best part? You can tune the difficulty settings to have as simulation or arcade as you like. The DLC is tremendous and expands the game in great ways. The racing and activities are challenging but not impossible (l2drift). The car selection is licensed, very real, and very large (like 800 cars? more?). Plus, the cars can be customized to your hearts content with upgrades, tuning profiles, and personal paint jobs. And the map, jesus. It's Britain, literally. A large portion of Britain. Driving around just feels immaculate. The world is highly detailed and almost entirely destructible. It feels as detailed and vibrant as a GTA world map, except I can't get out of my car. 

It's Burnout Paradise, Gran Turismo, and Need for Speed all rolled up into one massive racing game. Buy it on sale, buy the $60, go for broke and buy it all, it doesn't matter because you won't regret it.",1
1204,"As driving games go, it's the best I've ever played, not only because of its irresistible scenery, exhilarating driving and perfectly-recreated cars, but because spending time with it puts me in a lasting good mood. It is uncomplicated and thrilling escapism in a shared driving paradise. The game rewards exploration and silliness just as much as careful racing. Like the ""Burnout"" and ""Need for Speed"" games, ""Forza Horizon 4"" encourages plenty of ""arcade-style"" car gameplay. If you take your car off-road, for instance, and do a bunch of crazy jumps, ""Horizon 4"" actually rewards you for it. The absolute fastest car in Forza Horizon 4 is the Ferrari 599XX Evolution, which can be modified to hit an amazing top speed of 320mph.",1
1205,"Horizon 4 is one of those rare racing games that truly lets you play your way. There‚Äôs absolutely no stipulation that you have to progress through the game‚Äôs ‚Äústory‚Äù at all.

This game for those of us who don‚Äôt have hours to sink into a video game at a time, between work life and home life ‚Äì the ability to jump into the virtual world of Horizon and escape reality in a car you‚Äôve always dreamed of, sees this particular car game boast seemingly endless longevity.",1

1211,"Lest start with the game is fun. If you enjoy racing games with a slight simulation feel tha have an overall wealth of content available to you then the game will be fantastic at first. My gripe is with the stability of the game, on steam at least. The cloud seems to have a hard time syncing with the game, and often times the servers seem to be really bad at times. This is an issue i never had on the xbox. Long story short, buy the game for the console (I know blasphemy) it really is an overall better experience there. Ive got well over a 1000 hours on the console version and im not constantly troubleshooting something like I am on the pc verssion on steam.

You drive cars, listen to some tunes on the game's different radio stations and traverse across England completing tasks that catch your eye. I thought Horizon 3 was great, but 4 completely knocks it out of the park for me in my opinion. It's definitely a cautionary purchase for those who've played it previously on the Microsoft Store and hopefully they resolve those issues sometime soon, but for new players or those who love automobiles and racing games it's a grand time.",1

1219,It's a fun game when it decides to not delete your entire progress. I bought this game again on Steam after the Microsoft store version decided to erase all my progress. I had around 400 and something cars on that profile and around 300 and something hours before the game decided not to launch. I then decided to try and refresh the game files or whatever it's called under Microsoft Store and due to an oversight on my part I decided to not choose use cloud data after startup. It then deleted all my data of around 300 hours and all the cars I had collected up to that point. Understandably I then decided to uninstall the game from my computer. That was until it popped up here on Steam and since it said I had to start over anyhow since it will not carry data over from the Microsoft Store version I figured why not. Needless to say when the game is working it's a load of fun. Aside from the story missions they are horrible and mainly consist of getting from point A to B in under such and such time. The thing is the devs decided to make some of them next to impossible to get 3 stars unless you go offroad in a car that likes to be on the road or just flawless driving and taking all the correct lines. The voice acting for some of the characters during the story can be annoying as fuck since every time you restart you have to listen to them all over again. The kind that makes you want to drink yourself to death. Also the PVP and PVE arena events are toxic as fuck and some people would rather not help out the team and just expect you to carry them (or sit in last place for example). I guess as with every game you're going to have people like that. However everything else is so much fun and I'll still recommend this despite it's shortcomings.,1

1234,"[b]Forza Horizon 4 is the best racing game of all time. Period. [/b] 
Playground games has created a game that is nothing short of incredible for fans that want the perfect mix of casual arcade fun and sim racing.

What Horizon 4 lacks in comparison to stylized settings of other games like the neon lit city of the Underground games, it provides with a stunningly beautiful open world of countryside Britain with 4 varied seasons each week.
 
Each in-game season provides with new terrain changes and obstacles that your cars must adapt to the terrain if you wish to stand a chance in a race. 
With each varied race per season, the game provides with countless hours of fun and side activities that you can spend hours and hours on. Adding to it with the fantastic soundtrack selection on offer, races rarely get dull even online.  

This is further solidified with the absolutely titanic selection of cars that is on offer that caters to all kinds of play styles with builds that the player can meticulously fine tune to whatever suits their needs. With intricately designed interiors for each and every car, there is something for everyone.

The sense of a proper community can be felt in the game as well. It can be from downloading other players' tunes and livery designs to an auction house to battle out that car you want from other players, to also a fantastic hourly community-based event called ""Forzathon Live"", where a whole bunch of players get together at places in the map to chip away at a common goal for rewards and points. It is easily the most connected racing game of all time as well.

Adding to that the Fortune Island and Lego Island DLCs provide even more additional hours of fun for players that want to get even more from the game. Its 

The only thing that has is downside in this game, is you. 
That‚Äôs right. You! 
[i]I hope to god you clowns don‚Äôt get behind a wheel and start driving. Pedestrian deaths will be higher than deaths from intoxicated drivers. [/i]

I can go on and on. Everything is just too damn good!
But quite simply; Forza Horizon 4 is a masterpiece. Nothing short of it. 
Its absolutely worth every penny and you won‚Äôt regret it thanks to the insane amount of content on offer that can provide you with hours and hours of fun.
It has set a new gold standard for all racing games on what a proper racing experience should be while completely shaming the state of the modern NFS series and other racing titles. 


So, with all of my praise and the fact that this game is one of my all time favourite games with over 200 hours in total (Steam and UWP version in total), why the negative recommendation? 

Quite frankly, its the new Steam port of the game. 
It is littered with issues that can be utterly infuriating, that never existed with the UWP version of the game. What was a game far better optimized than FH3 to provide players with a smooth experience even on a crappy laptop, is now ruined for some. Unfortunately these problems are too annoying to ignore. 
The issues I most faced are: 

- Constantly painful stutters and struggling to keep a stable framerate
- Stuttering after a race ends (still there after recent patches)
- Plenty of random crashes
- Random disconnection from online matches
- Random freezes in DLC maps
- Every player in an online match randomly disconnecting, aside you and one other
- Online games taking up to 10 minutes to finish loading 
- Stuck in race's leaderboard screen after online match has ended
- Incorrectly detecting monitor's refresh rate if you use dual screens
- Placeholder cars being shown when claiming barn find cars
- Certain Steam achievements not being unlocked properly

None of the above issues existed with the Windows store version. 
And if these hiccups happened a few times far in between, it wouldn't be that big of a deal. But I encounter at least 2 of the above problems in every play session I have. 

While the game is nothing short of incredible, I can't recommend it until Playground games fixes the issues with the Steam port. 

Once Playground games fixes the issues with the Steam port, Forza Horizon 4 is an easy 10/10...",0

And there is a lot of content. I find Visiting the UK is great. And if you have a Nvidia 3060 RTX or better. Then it will run this game great at 1440p with 70fps. I can't think of any flaw. Other then I wish graphics wise it had more settings for extreme instead of just a few settings to be set to that. Overall I would recommend this game more so if its on sale. I feel its worth picking up. And I will add the game is fun. :),1

Beautiful graphics, and a lot of nice features. Alot of cars/trucks/suv's and random mix ins. Love the ""Barn Finds"" as nice collectibles with rewards. Was able to push on lowest settings with Core 2 Quad Q8400/8GB DDR2/RX550 4GB with no major issues, but a much better experience on Ryzen 5 2600/16GB DDR4/RX580 8GB.",1
1248,"It crashes, a lot (I mean the game, not the car. though I admit my driving skills are average at best). it can happen anytime, like just a few minutes after starting the game or when you're in the middle of an event. thankfully, the game autosaves pretty often so not much progress was lost but it's still annoying. I heard that the windows store version doesn't have this issue, or have but less often, so if you want you can buy this game there instead. apart from the crashing issue, I haven‚Äôt found any other bugs yet and the game runs pretty well in my pc.

so, about the game then, Forza Horizon 4 is an open-world racing game. the map is quite spacious, and you can drive pretty much anywhere on the map (mind some of the water bodies though, those can only be driven when frozen at winter season). this differs from other open world racing games where their maps maybe larger but only the roads that are drivable. the graphics are pretty good even at medium-high settings I‚Äôm playing at. Some places are just so beautiful to look at and sometimes I just like to drive slowly and enjoy the scenery.

For the racing part, Forza Horizon 4 is not a simulator. Sure, it has some difficulty settings to make your driving a bit more realistic and car tuning with telemetry to perfect it but in the end it‚Äôs just a racing game with a bit realism in it. Also, you don‚Äôt mess with the police in this game so you just drive and race for fun. The game features many cars to drive, and all of them can be tuned to your liking. Obtaining cars in this game are quite easy. Some cars can be bought and some other are free to get from events or wheelspins, or even in an auction house inside the game. 

You can opt to play online or offline whenever you want. When starting a race, you can choose to play with bots (drivatars) or match with other players for a multiplayer race. Most of the time other players would race pretty fairly (at least in my experience) but when you play ranked, players would often ram you off the road, pretty much the usual online racing experience. What I like the most in an online session is the #Forzathon LIVE event that takes place every real-life hour where you drive with other players to complete challenges and get some separate in-game currency to buy rare cars.

In conclusion, I think Forza Horizon 4 a fun racing game to play where you can endlessly roam its open world or race with or without other players. The crashing issue can be annoying at times but when I can play for hours without crash, it is simply a fun game to play. Highly recommend.",1

DLC Tips: Just get Ultimate, but if you have to choose...
- Fortune Island is a blast, a must have
- Car pass is nice to have
- VIP can lessen your forzathon grind burden
- Don't get treasure map, it ruins all the exploring fun.
- Lego sucks, unless you get Ultimate, then it can kill some time
- Paid car packs doesn't really worth it unless you get Ultimate, then it can also kill some time",1

1257,"Okay. I don't give a rat's butthole what anyone says. This game. Is Effing trash.

first of all...CARS...DO NOT...MAGICALLY....FORCE THE STEERING WHEEL...INTO NEUTRAL...WHEN BREAKING.

You can LITERALLY BE TURNING SHARP LEFT OR RIGHT AND THE BREAK WILL SNAP YOUR ENTIRE EFFING CAR AND NEGATE YOUR TURN IN ITS ENTIRETY!

This IS NOT POSSIBLE. I don't care that it's a video game! I race cars in real life! THIS DOES NOT HAPPEN. My car is NOT some kind of magic POS with spherical wheels that can just completely negate any action im taking and forcing me face first into a wall!

I don't care about how Tuning can offset it! it shouldn't be possible to begin with!! Tires locking means your your tires LOCK. They cannot turn until they UNLOCK. it does NOT mean that it will pivot your car that is ACTIVELY TURNING A CORNER back to your FORMER DIRECTION and PARTIALLY NEGATE the action you are ACTIVELY TAKING. 

Ignoring the 38 hard crashes I've had over the last two weeks, and the fact that somehow my Nissan Skyline GTR-34 got outsped on a straight line against a mother effing FREIGHT TRUCK not to mention a freaking RX-7 managed to launch RIGHT PAST me making my Skyline(Which was at the top of it's class) look like a body kit on a Datsun, the unrealistic magical breaking is what killed this game for me.

This game is absolute horse crap and I'm just gonna delete my NFS Heat save and play that since IF NOTHING ELSE, I don't have to see my car just ""LOL NOPE"" me into a wall EVEN THOUGH I WAS ALREADY TURNING.

UGH. Fking...blugh! *Leaves*

Oh and there's the fact this game is 80 bucks and 3 years old and fking MICROSOFT studio can't make a stable game for the MICROSOFT windows 10 Operating system. How Ironic.
The only storefront I absolutely cannot get to work is the MS store and the only game that has ever crashed this consistently for me is a MICROSOFT game designed by MICROSOFT on a MICROSOFT OS.
STILL cannot connect to H servers either. Good job MS. 14 days and still we can't connect to your server. on a game that's 3 years old. Brilliant.",0

1260,"EDIT: Online is completely broken on Steam version. Getting stuck on loading screens, and scoreboards almost every time, before and after every single races. If you wait 2-5 minutes (seriously) its starting but most of players are hard quitting (alt+f4) the game. I waited 3 minutes and 8 players were left. Tried again, same results. So problem is not about my connection or pc. And you are getting bored quickly on singleplayer(ive played only singleplayer or seasonal s*hit to now). With this condition of this awesome game, sadly, i must say that DO NOT even touch this game. Game is really amazing but wait for solution of problems or if you have to play it, pay more bucks from Micros*hit store. Its so ridiculous.
-Constant crashes (once in an hour mostly)
-Performance issues (Frequent fps drops, stutters)
-Online problems (Infinite loadings...)
-Affecting windows and causing system issue (Well its a Microsoft game and after i installed that game im having huge cpu usage on wmi host provider service and having max ram usage sometimes)
This might be about my system though but other problems are same for any other players on internet.
-There is no 1 fullscreen support (game is always running and consuming your hardware no matter you minimized or focus another program, therefore you can adjust hardware usage from nvidias control panel which ive never tried, even if you do that, game has problems about minimazing itself)
-BR mode. Really? Level 6 car can easily beat level 9 on launch. Same line, wheelspin control ON. Just a reminder for players. Eliminator mode (BR) is trash like any other BR's
I don't care rest of the game. If a racing game fails on these sides, it doesn't deserve positive review. After a nice update surely i will change to positive because this game is really good. Ive heard that only Steam version that bad.

Fix this game Microsoft, actually fix yourself first.

1262,Great game I really like changing season events and cars details but fix DAMN random crash!!!!,0
1263,"I have tried and tried to enjoy this game but the winter has truly ruined it. Not because of racing in the snow, because it is beautiful to see.

1st Reason. Prebuilt setups not showing what kind of tyres they have on them and you cannot change the tyres without removing the setup entirely, so you keep buying setup after setup, wasting money until you find a set with snow tyres.

I asked on the forums and got ignored so posted the following
It's not explained in game, it's not in any YT guides, it's not on google and it's not in the forums. To me, wanting to know what kind of tyres I am buying is 1 of the most important aspects, especially in a game with seasons. Yet it is not explained anywhere and no1 is willing to help ? 
I'll have no choice but to quit when my money is all gone and my cars still don't have the correct tyres because it doesn't show on a premade locked build.

2nd reason. Seasonal events.
1 of the racing ones I tried 3 times and failed them all because my own team kept ramming me out and making me miss checkpoints. Last attempt I was in 1st in round 1 and got knocked out by a team mate making me respawn in 8th, round 2 I came 1st, round 3 I got knocked out by team mate and finished 7th.

Then 1 with 5 rounds of flags, infected and king. Well lol.. I was watching the minimap while I was king and a red just spawned right next to me. I went to get a different 1 and as I connected, it went partially invisible and I drove straight through it. Then the flags..  On defence, I had a flag bearer drive straight through me when I was blocking the path and on our turn, a red in base camping our flag. 

I knew as soon as we started round 1 I was not going to like it and just wanted it over, but I gave it my all for the sake of completing it and getting it out the way. I am not putting myself through that again.
---------------------------------
Other things that bug me are:-
Playing solo and having lego cars in the race when I don't have the DLC (and never will).
Ads for DLC's, which wouldn't be so bad if they weren't so long.
Map is way too small.
Too many missions piled in the same place making it frustrating as hell trying to click on 1 in order to set route.
---------------------
I am done with this bs. I am trying and fkin trying to get these seasonals done but every sodding time its the same. People pushing me out, AI cars pushing me out or on coming traffic. On the difficulty it has to be done on with all of that makes it impossible and damn right bloody frustrating. I almost broke my controller twice tonight because it's getting to me so much. 3 days totally wasted. 

Uninstalled.. For bloody ever!",0
1264,"Forza Horizon 4 is remarkable game. It's a racer that's for everybody, instantly accessible for people who don't play racing games, but with enough depth and difficulty to satisfy gamers who prefer simulation. The very premise of Horizon 4 is fun. The quirky, bouncy voice-overs and the festival vibe keeps things free and light-hearted. Races are aimed at creating tight, balanced races that are fun no matter what vehicle you drive, and it does this well. It's fun to just jump in a random race you find.

There is a lot of depth to the game, multiple race disciplines keep things interesting and all are genuinely fun. If you get bored of one discipline you can jump in another and get the hang of it really quickly. It doesn't force you through awkward drifting mini-games or shift orientated drag races.

Graphically the game is stunning. There is no other word, the cars and environments are photo-realistic. Set any screenshot as my desktop background and I wouldn't even suspect it wasn't the Lake District. The cars themselves look fantastic lighting is done very well.

The seasons mechanics is one of the main attractions to Forza Horizon 4 and have to say it is an interesting one. Certain driving disciplines are more tailored to different seasons, so Winter is good for dirt for example, and Summer more for road racing, and that can get frustrating if you want to change seasons. Seasons are locked to the servers, meaning every week they change, you can't change them in game by moving ahead seasons for example. Each season though does look amazing in its own way, and adds diversity to game campaign.

Forza Horizon 4 is a beautiful game, well-polished and full of cars and stunning environments. One more for the casual crowd but fun nonetheless, a fantastic celebration of car culture.",1

This game is really just an arcade racer that gives you everything from the start without having to work for anything. The physics are rubbish to be honest.
Let me tell you a story:
I love a good hybrid arcade/realistic racing game such as the Dirt Rally games that need some skill and are rewarding. But I only enjoy them if I am sober. Occasionally I enjoy a drink and for the life of me I cannot play Dirt Rally games as I crash all the time as those games require some element of skill. So in the event I am pissed out of my head then I can load up Forza 4 and have no fear of crashing as I am a driving God even drunk and can have my fix of racing. Forza certainly is not a good advertisement for drink driving.",1

That said, 3 years after the game has been released, I saw it comming out on Steam and then bit the bullet and bought it. (Not cheap, but affordable). Theres alot to mension being wrong here. Little jitters and game crashes are just irritating  and then the whole thing of not being able to even join an online game with my kid was the last straw. I started reading up on this and seems there are alot of people with same issues on their purchase from Steam on this game. Don't get me wrong, the game is awesome and was as expected.

After Rolling back to NVIDIA 522.25 the game is stable, but still sometimes crashes while visiting a house.

In my opinion, when it comes to racing simulation, Gran Turismo takes the cake. But Forza offers something different, that being the freedom of driving around in free roam. The game is quite fun and it is also fun to play with friends in convoy as well. If you are a loner you may come across some fellas that dig your ride or find your style interesting and may join you with whatever you are up to like I had this dude follow me and drift along with me after seeing my Lancer Evolution VIII from Fast and the Furious Tokyo Drift. :P

1335,"Forza Horizon 4 is an open world, racing, pvp game that offers a real life looking Doc Hudson! but it also offers a variety of game modes such as your classic asphalt races to racing with a spaceship from halo. Although there are a lot of modes, they are stretched out to their limits because Playground Games wants this to be a 60 hour plus game. By the time you have played 20 hours you have experienced every idea that this game has to offer you are left to spend the next 40 hours of the game doing the same thing over and over again. So if you dont like repetitive missions this isnt the game for you but luckilly for me i have a goblin brain which means if something is fun i will do it for hours and hours without feeling any emotion which is perfect for this game.

Speaking about missions this game has ""story missions"" and they are a joke i made the idiotic decision to do all of them. The game hits you with the best one right of the bat, in which you are filming movie scenes where you jump of cliffs and all that, it isnt amazing but its ok. But then the rest are a complete ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• fest, you have sub par voice acting, ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• animations, and annoying characters. Now this is a racing game so all that matters is the gameplay which is fine but when some of the missions are impossible because of the season(‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• you winter) you end up retrying the same thing for hours untill you say ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• it and go to a youtube video look at the comments and then find some person to say ""dont even try to do it in winter"" and in that point you start to have an existential breakdown.

I bought the ultimate edition and it comes with two dlcs, and they are the best part of the game. It starts showing you new and exciting stuff which woke up my goblin brain, it started to bring me back to the first 20 hours of the game. Fortune Island is this amazing looking island with new challenges and it feels fresh the majority of my photos are from this island, it looks amazing! Then theres the lego one which is very creative everything you smash is lego, the animals are lego, the humans are lego, the cars are lego. When you start to race a bugatti with your lego bugatti you start to wonder why isnt the main game this creative.

Also has some of the worst car noises ever. I mean gta5 has better car noises then this shit.

After 86 hours of palying this game none stop for a month and finding that there is no decent Lightning McQueen skin i can safely say its a 7/10 game",1
1336,"Best racing game I have played recently. I am more fan of an arcade racer (Burnout, Need for Speed, etc) tbh and at first, really hesitant to get this game.

Graphically, its still pretty breathtaking, for a 2018 game. Seasons are awesome, it makes the game feels fresh every week. 

All in all, I really enjoy this game. 

Be warned tho, there are still some issue with the game. Random crashing when joining convoy or after race. Random disconnect when playing ranked and the unranked matchmaking sometimes gets a really long loading screen. I hope the dev fixes it in the future.",1
1337,"i have the recommended hardware plus, not overclocked or tweaked, and it crashes repeatedly most times.  i had purchased to play with my friends because they play it, when it worked i had fun playing it, seemed like it was going to be the next game i got sucked into.  sadly it does not stay running long enough for you to do that.  seems poorly optimized, and unstable.  would love to just play for at least an hour after work, but it's the only game i have that will not run on this pc.  my friends that switched over from xbox also come into this issue pretty much everytime they try to play as well, sometimes crashing 5 or 6 times+.",0
1338,"I have never done a review until now. I love driving games and I really want to love this game... WHEN IT DOES NOT CRASH! So many issues with this it's not even funny. Every time I want to play I first have to go into my Windows settings under gaming and have to ALWAYS fix the XBOX NETWORKING NAT. ""Teredo is unable to qualify."" So I have to hit the ""FIX IT"" button and only then do I get a ""MODERATE"" connection. Even in game it all of a sudden it just drops the NAT connection and have to repeat the ""fix"" to continue to play online. Now every day at least once it will crash. I have had no issues with games I have played here on Steam, however, this is the ONLY one that gives me issues BIG TIME! It is a great game when it does work. But with all the NAT issues and randomly crashing for no reason it makes it very hard to enjoy. If you truly want to get this game I would STRONGLY ADVISE waiting till it's on sell for at least 50% off.",0

1340,"Forza Horizon 4. The magnum opus of open world racing game. A safe haven of hundreds of cars. A canvas to pour your inner creativity. It's almost unnecessary to introduce this well-known franchise. Chances are you already knew what Horizon is all about, and you're reading the review section just for fun.

Horizon is a sim-cade game, a balance between realism and arcade fun. Vehicles on simulation setting behave and feel almost like a real car, over correcting often resulting a date between your car and a tree. There are 4 discipline of racing. Road Racing is the normal road surfaces, Street Scene is the underworld illegal races with traffics, Dirt Racing are basically rally. And Cross Country is the heavy 4x4 offroad branch. Multiplayer are a blast with drift adventures, ranked matchmaking, playground games, you name it. Although sometimes you get stuck in menus for like 2+ minutes.

Graphics are amazing, somehow they made a scenery that's both realistic and surreal. There's alot of car details, world details, etc. One of Horizon's unique feature is the camera. It lets you capture beautiful pictures in the game with actual photography properties like focus, aperture, shutter speed and many more. There's actually too much in this game to write a review instead of a novel.

It's a shame everything is in slideshow mode a.k.a heavy stuttering. Let's be honest, Horizon was never a stable game in the first place. Unfortunately, the steam port was even much bigger disaster. In racing games, every single piece of time is precious, even miliseconds. Combining stuttering and racing is like a complete paralyze and blindness in a moment while racing. Imagine going 300kmh then stutter, suddenly you lose your braking point. Some people experiencing CTDs, freezing, server issues and so on. Personally I've been experiencing heavy stutter, the devs did actually know about these but have yet propose a solution. I hope the devs actually care about this game, and patch out these major problems. I and alot of other people really want to enjoy this game. It's a great game with miserable execution.",0

The DLCs give you a couple dozen cars (including some of the fastest in the game), some houses, and a couple hundred grand of cash. While this sounds good, it completely ruins the initial progression and rise in car quality.

1397,"So far this game is pretty good, even though I hate the starter cars you get when you first start. 
I've read up on other reviews about the microstuttering issues, and I've been getting the same issues, despite having a decent PC for the game(GPU is way higher than what is recommended, CPU is pretty much the recommended, along with RAM. 

A solution? What I've noticed is that when I get into the open world part of the game, if I wait for a minute or three, it'll stop microstuttering. So I have a feeling that this actually is a game issue, and it has yet been fixed whenever this game had came out. Yes I still stutter on loading screens(I believe it's because it's loading the game), and usually when I begin a race/event for the story missions, it usually has a big stutter at the beggining before being playable again.

Do I recommend this game? Yeah, if you're willing to get over the random microstutters when you load into the first few minutes of the open world, then you'll be fine after waiting a few minutes. 
Should they fix their game? Yes, nobody should be paying 60$ for a game that stutters a lot. People claim it's because of your PC, but it's not. Even after I turned down the graphics to medium(Nvidia says I can handle higher settings btw), it still stutters.",1

None of the suggestions worked and the game simply refuses to start (the client just sits there in the Task Manager not doing anything).  My PC absolutely demolishes the system requirements for it as well.

Then I bought the game on Steam and thought I'd love to support the Devs because I'm in love with this game, but sadly the game runs horrible on Steam. I played with the same settings etc. and was shook when I saw how bad the performance all of the sudden was. I'd recommend waiting till they resolve the issues with fps drops / stuttering or generally wait for FH5.

TLDR; Don't buy the game on Steam, it runs horrible. Stick to the Microsoft Store where the game runs smoothly.",0
1444,"I can stand by the game itself and would definitely give it a thumbs up but as this is a review on the Steam version then I have to give it a thumbs down for the absurd price this game demands.
I instead refunded the ¬£85 ultimate edition and instead purchased the Xbox Ultimate Pass for PC for ¬£1. 
I now have the same game for ¬£84 less but just not all the DLC's which appear to be rather lackluster.
I typically play a game for a long time over a few weeks then pretty much never replay it therefore the ¬£1 pass is far superior for my personal needs.

TLDR: Good game itself but can be purchased for ¬£1 over on Xbox games pass without the DLC.

1449,"ONLINE GAME IS TERRIBLE. Just copied someone's comment about this, 100% 1.

Don't even try to join a race together because the process tends to be convoluted and end up with someone disconnected. Now, if you actually manage to join a race or event pray that the rest of the people actually connect to it. If you are lucky enough you will be able to play some. Otherwise, you are probably gonna get stuck at some loading screen for literal 10 minutes while the game tries to find or synchronize players.
It's just, awful. Absolutely pathetic that a game this modern can't figure out a proper online system that doesn't suck like this. It's barely functional sometimes and it really blows my mind how you can be waiting for 10 or more minutes trying to do something without even the option to cancel the loading so you have to straight up close the game.",0

- NFS has realistic car sounds, heck even crew 2 has better engine sounds
- the whole tuning I feel is better in NFS heat.

1456,"These micro stutters were not present in the Windows version of this game, the one I played 200+ hours of. They are unacceptable and should've been fixed day one.

Also every time I exit this game and unplug my Xbox controller, it turns on my Series X. I think its telling me to play this game on that, as even the console version runs better then the Steam version.

DISCLAIMER: I RECOMMEND THIS GAME, BUT DO NOT RECOMMEND YOU BUYING IT ON STEAM. GET IT ON THE WINDOWS STORE OR XBOX.",0
1457,"First, to my Hardcore ""Simulation Only"" friends, I shook my head ""no"" too. Several Forza Horizons and Motorsports have came and went before I gave this a try simply because it is arcade.

This is ""anti-arcade"" mentality is something I used to suffer from. Forza 4 cured it. This is currently the best overall driving experience if you are being honest with yourself and those that you pretend care about your virtual driving.


If you want to have big fun in a vehicle... this and the term ""big fun"" are for you. If you have the perfect ""sim"" but wish it had more freedom.... get this. If your favorite ""simcade"" title does not have your favorite car... this probably does... go get it.

1466,"I've heard that the Forza Horizon series tends to draw in those who aren't normally into racing games. It's hard for me to say exactly why, but I definitely feel that way after playing this. As someone who isn't typically into driving games or cars in general, I've found this game pretty relaxing and fun to play.

I think it gets the difficulty curve just right. Things like assists, handling, racer AI, etc. are highly customizable and rather than penalizing you for playing on an easier difficulty, you're instead rewarded slightly for turning these assists off. It does a great job at teaching you how to play, and then easing you into challenging yourself if you're up for it.

Other things that I think drew me in: it's a big open world game, so as someone who likes exploring, I found a lot to like here. Building and tuning the cars and tailoring different your builds for different types of races (street, road, dirt, off-road, etc) makes the game feel like an RPG, which I also enjoy.

Lastly, I can put any anime girl I want as a vinyl wrap on my cars and drive them off of cliffs while listening to liquid drum and bass on the in-game radio. Pretty cool, not gonna lie.",1

1476,"---THE GOOD---
Amazing Car Customization
Stunning open world graphic
Many difficulty setting to set fit to your own experience
Credit (Game money to buy cars, upgrade, house, etc...) is plenty. So, you don't have to grind 99 hours to buy a car.
Many car variation to choose (300+)
In-dept decal customization as I have seen many artist showed off on their car decals.

---THE BAD---
Friction and Grip physics make you feel like you have put oil on your wheel.
Car just need 1 inch out side track, the car will spin like washing machine.
Learning curve is very high if you want to learn how to tune.
GAME CRASH AFTER 10-50 MINS OF GAME TIME. 
Playing with steering wheel feels lack luster and underwhelming. 1force, vibration features does not work at all.
Shifting light indicator does not work.
Default setting for steering wheel is trash. Need many hours to fine tune to your personal liking.
(Not that i am saying plenty option is bad but the default setting should give you an average experience)
Dual monitors support is meh. FOV angle option need to be wider for 1st person cockpit view.
Oh did i mention the game crash too often ? KEKW. Mainly caused by memory leak which prove the developers coding is mommy spagetti and QA have not done good job testing it.

---Conclusion---
Play with steering wheel for the experience but play with controller for win.
Buy during sale not worth during sale.",1

1479,"This game lured me in with flawless, hitch-less gameplay for first 8 hours of my session. 
As soon as I tried to play with my friend, it went to all hell.

First off - Steam users are unable to play along with people from Microsoft Store - As soon as you join eachother in a convoy, your game will crash. After that incident, the game began crashing every 10 - 30 minutes, just a freeze and a CTD, no error logs, no anything, nothing changed. I've tried looking for support for these issues, but I've only found reddit threads everyone expressing their frustrations over the same reasons without any kind of fix.

The developers don't even acknowledge any of these major, game-breaking bugs, or provide any kind of support.

Buy at your massive discretion, I've seen people's reviews of them playing for dozens of hours without any problems, and then we have the other half of the community, being ripped of their purchase.

I've heard that the Microsoft Store/Xbox version is much more optimized, so get that if you can, don't be tempted by the Steam privileges.",0

FPS drops are horrific, I used to get stable 70+ in ultra settings with a 1650 but on steam I struggle to keep my frames above 45. Another thing is the trigger rumble. If you have an Xbox controller and yearning to play with trigger vibration then bad luck cause they are not supported on steam version for some godforsaken reason DESPITE being a first party Xbox app. They also used to work on Game Pass/MSStore version as well and they don't seem to be willing to add the support back. Other games such as Tomb Raider and F1 has trigger rumble support but a first party app doesn't? Such a joke.",0

1491,"Well they haven't fixed the issue that makes the game crash whenever there is an update in graphics driver or any other driver. Fresh installed windows have the same timely crash the game crashes within 10, 30 or 1 hr 30 min mark every single time. it freezes when changing cars or just freezes randomly with music playing in the background i noticed that every crash makes the game use only 4gb of ram and cpu and gpu usage drops under 10 but it doesnt shows not responding but the game never comes back. if you want to know my specs i run r7 3800xt with rtx 3060ti and 16gb ram i have checked everything and am not the only one among my friends with this issue. plus i cant revert back to old insecure driver to play just one game. if anyone wants to play forza i request you to buy forza five as the devs seems to be forcing players anyways.",0
1492,"While the game itself is a great racing game and extremely enjoyable to play, the game will continuously crash once reaching the ""online only"" portion of the game after the tutorial (about 2 hours into the game).  In my case I was able to to get the product refunded since I presented technical evidence of the problem to Steam.  The game's log slates the crash occurs when trying to invoke the function to connect to the online servers.  Multiple Procmon captures of the issue show that the game uses an internal Docker component and the issue seems to be related to when it invokes that Docker component (the failure results start once Docker enters into the process).  I've tried several forms of bypassing the issue (and as a certified ethical hacker, C|EH, I know quite a few ways to ""fool"" a program) to no avail suggesting that the only one who can fix this issue is the developer.  Buyers beware, this game is unplayable in the current format except for the initial offline tutorial that just so happens to be around 2 hours (the time in which refunds no longer are available save for filed cases being approved by Steam).  Also given Forza Horizon 5 is already out, I'd be surprised if they put any effort into resolving the issue anytime soon.  Lesson learned, I'm not buying Forza products anymore if the devs can't keep them working.",0

1536,"The Forza Motorsport / Forza Horizon series has consistently delivered flagship racing games and Forza Horizon 4 is perhaps the best of them all, at least on paper. There is a great amount of content in (almost) every category, from the number of cars to customization. What holds this game back the most is the DLC walls and performance issues. Still, for anyone looking for a great racing game this is a great option (short of a simulation experience).

PROS:
- Fun and engaging gameplay that will satisfy any player that isn't looking for simulation levels of control
- An absolute stunning number of cars, each with a (mostly) exceptional level of detail
- Great visuals that benefit greatly from the ability of PC's
- A great amount of content to engage with both in online and offline play

CONS:
- Performance issues on PC, with frequent crashing in certain situations
- DLC wall is presented too often for cars that should be included in the base game
- Game is currently overpriced, this game has been out too long to expect full price",1

This is my first Forza game and now i understand the hype, such a detailed world with great driving and sounding cars that doesn't hold your hands in terms of mechanics but still gets you to stand on your own. 100% recommend it if you can get it on sale cause this game too expensive for an older game. Still worth buying even if 5 is out.",1
1538,"Broken
That's how I describe the Steam version of Forza Horizon 4, I was looking forward to enjoy this game without the bother of Microsoft's inferior Windows store and the limitation of the Xbox One and I was looking forward to the luxury of driving the greatest car's from some of the most renown car manufacturers in the world.
But no, instead the game likes to judder with stuttering making you wonder why you'd bother spending of your hard earned money when a second hand Xbox One would be a easier experience to play this game.
And if you have a steering wheel like the Logitech G920 It's only useful if you enjoy driving at full reverse while looking to the right.
But wait, what about the the inferior Windows store is it the same as the Steam version?
Well there's good news the sort answer is no, I've test the demo which is outdated but it's better optimised, no stuttering and the steering just works it's almost witchcraft.

TL;DR Steam version is broken, get it on the Windows store.",0

1568,"Pros:
- Fantastic driving experience (unless you use a logitech wheel or enjoy FFB in any way)
- Gameplay is excellent
- Vehicle selection is huge
- Very polished UI
- Voice acting is OK
- Beautiful landscapes, scenery, and road maps

Mediocre:
- Character models are basic
- Fortnite style dance moves are stupid and cringey

Cons
- The random yet constant crashing to desktop
- The lack of any sort of bug/crash report telling you why it crashed
- The clear fact that despite the push from YT creators like MKBHD with that useless '8K' gaming video featuring FH4.. that the devs couldn't be bothered fixing the CTD issue.

This is worse than Cyberpunk 2077. At least I have faith that CDPR will fix CP2077 (and have done a lot with patch 1.2) but I don't expect anything close to this will come from Playground Games.

I thought it might be my system so I did the usual test when I find a buggy and poorly made game.

1. Wipe entire system, reset bios to clear any overclocks, set GPU to stock clocks
2. Clean install Windows 10 via internet
3. Install latest drivers for graphics, motherboard, etc
4. Install Steam and download only the affected game
5. Shutdown and cold boot the PC
6. Play for an hour

Results? Crashed in the 4th race mid-corner about 20mins in. Reboot and it crashed about 30mins in.

It's not my PC. Considering it's a Core i9 10900K, ASUS RTX 3080 Strix, 32GB RAM.

Absolutely wonderful game let down by poor porting to the steam platform.

Edit (06/04/21) - Currently awaiting Update 34 with apparent fixes for crashing. Will update review if there's any change to the CTD issue.

Edit (07/04/21) - Update 34 released
Still crashing to desktop, just more frequently now. Stuttering has also become worse and lasts longer after initial load and rejoining free roam. Reinstalled drivers and game, no difference. 

Edit (14/04/21) - 1 week after Update 34
Remains as buggy as before. Will randomly crash 2 minutes into the game requiring a reboot or at a random point 30-90mins into the game. Both free roam and racing. No such issues with any other racing game in my library (Assetto Corsa, Project Cars 2, DIRT, etc)

Edit (11/05/21) - Update 35
Still just as bad. Stutter with the wheel, lagging, and online is so broken now. At least this gives me more time to focus on ACC and PC2

Edit (13/05/21) - Wheel issues
FFB is completely broken and steering is super loose with the Logitech G923. Works a little better with the G29. Don't get this game if you intend to use the G923.


Dev team behind this game remains to be a complete joke and a disgrace when compared to the devs for ACC, PC2, AM2, etc.",0
1569,"Forza Horizon series is the closest we have to a perfect racing game. Driving model is a blend of simulation and arcade (cars drive very realistically, but you still have grip when you brake in a corner and stuff like that), and is extremely engaging, because you ain't gonna win if you don't drive good. In fact, driving in this game is so extremely fun that driving around aimlessly is more fun than most racers out there.

And also you get like 750 or something cars to choose from, with the ability to fine-tune almost every aspect of them. A must-play for any racing fan.",1

- crashes

I would usually recommend buying things on steam because of the great customer support, however, I do not recommend buying this game on steam.",0

I had this on the XBox pass and it seemed to work perfectly with my Logitech G29 wheel. I no longer have the pass though, so I bought it on sale here.

The game ran perfectly in terms of performance but I had horrible trouble with my wheel. After an hour of playing with settings and watching setup videos, I got it reasonably controllable but then encountered massive input delays from the wheel when I entered into a race. I spent the next hour trying to fix this and found lots of people with the same issues, some saying the Steam version suffers from this. No one had a fix but lots of people were saying game patches introduced these issues..

Would be a real shame if we made people waste their time on unskipable cringy cutscenes all the time.
Or made some of those cutscenes literal adds, in a full-price game.
Or made players watch zany dances of robotic barbie-doll avatars, cause we need to show players more stupid crap we're trying to monetize.
Or made them sit through spinning roulette animations to make them artificially excited for getting a meaningless reward.
Or if we would focus on stupid Skinner Box mechanics so heavily that it's hard to find any real fun in there.
Or forgot to make the multiplayer maybe sometimes possibly work from time to time and actually let people play with friends without disconnecting them after race 2 out of 5 because oops something went wrong, please try again lol.""

This game is a MASTERPIECE!!! Thank you so much for releasing this game on Steam, Microsoft.
For real. This is one of the best open-world arcade racing game I've ever played. And this game is my favourite open-world racing game. (Please don't hate me, NFS player.)

The controls, graphics, car roster, soundtracks and the open world are PERFECT!
[spoiler] YOU CAN EVEN DRIVE THE HALO WARTHOG TRUCK IN THIS GAME. 
BOY, THAT'S JUST CRAAAAAAAZZZZZZZYYYYYYYY!!!!!!!!![/spoiler] 

There is a lot of stuff to do. It's not like that you will complete this game in a few hours.

I bought the Ultimate Edition of this game and it's worth the money, especially if you buy it on sale.
The DLCs are also worth to buy. The Lego Expansion and Fortune Island have separate maps. And they're also HUGE!

Unfortunately, I heard that Forza games won't last long (only four years). So if you want to buy this game, you need to hurry up. I heard that this game might get delisted this year because Forza Horizon 4 was released in 2018. 
It's a shame if you miss this opportunity to buy it. (Like I regret not buying Forza Horizon 3 on PC. X(
Ouch.)

Total and a message to XBox Game Studio/Microsoft:
Thank you so much for allowing Steam players to discover the world of XBOX.
I'm looking forward to play Forza Motorsport when this game come out in 2023.

But I have a question.
Could you please release your older games (Forza Horizon 1,2,3; Forza Motorsport, ...) on Steam, if it's even possible?
I'm looking forward to play those old games. ^^",1

1605,"To be fairly honest! I never thought such a game like 'Forza' which was destined only for Microsoft users (Xbox, PC and not PS) would be so impressive, because you see i was a PlayStation player in the past and i never knew the experience for PC and Xbox. 

When i became old enough to own a mediocre PC, i was not able to afford it on the Microsoft store, and 'if' i would've been able to afford it, it would have never run on my poorly built PC back then. So i spent days and nights working my ass off to be able to afford what i needed, this game was never my priority. 

But now that i am able to afford all the luxury stuffs i want, and gather dozens of games at the same time, it came clear to my mind that 'Forza' was something that if i didn't buy, my journey would have never been completed, because beyond all this work experience, hard times and luxuries, in the deepest of thoughts, there was still that little french kid which was sitting in a corner and dreaming about cars. 


So here we are, this game is so immersive to me as a dream come 1, and i would never seize to talk about it, whatever the age i will be or how old the game gets, the words will remain as positive as it has always been. Thank you for everything!

I, however, am sad to say that I cannot in good conscience recommend it in its current state: the game keeps crashing. At different intervals everytime but it WILL happen. To that, the only answer <we get is to reinstall an older GPU driver. Which I think it a lot to ask to your players, specially when you know the risks involved in ignoring software updates notably in terms of security.

This game will get a thumbs up when the crashing issue gets fixed. Until then, even though I got it at 35‚Ç¨ for a discount, it is so unstable that I feel like I was ripped off...

1632,"DISCLAIMER: although this review is a 'NOT RECOMMENDED' it does reflect my view of the game as a whole.

for the time i've played, this game looks, feels, and plays great. the only problem is that i have and have seen a lot of others have currently is the game bugging out and freezing every 15-20 minutes after an event. there maybe ways around this, but unfortunately i have not found a solution to this. 

besides the annoying crashes, this game is good. 7.5/10",0
1633,"THE MUSIC IS MAKING ME GO INSANE. Every race start skips music to a ""cool"" part to sync up with the start. Cool for the first 20 minutes of playing, absolutely horrible afterwards because IT'S ALWAYS THE SAME. Luckily you can disable that by turning the radio off. What you can't disable is the music coming from speakers next to tracks, which IS ALSO ALWAYS THE SAME PART OF THE SAME 4 SONGS. IT'S HORRIBLE. AND IT'S ALSO ON THE POST-RACE SCREEN, ALWAYS THE SAME STUPID MUSIC, TURN IT OFF ALREADY!

Also annoying are the stupid UI animations. Browsing menus or going in/out of menus takes hours of your life away because you have to wait for stupid animations or cutscenes, during which your input is blocked. Want to enter a house? gotta wait for a stupid cutscene of your car driving up there for 6 seconds, even though you've already seen it a million times!

I'd give a negative recommentation because all of that if it wasn't for the awesome driving experience. Very much fun with a steering wheel, a bit annoying with keyboard once you have faster cars. Graphics and details are amazing too Unfortunaly the above makes anything else than freeroaming around a shit experience.",1

1653,"This review is for Steam Deck ONLY, If you're playing on a windows PC, get the game. It is one of, if not the best racing game on Steam IMO.

If you have a Steam Deck, you shouldn't buy this game. Everything I say here applies to Horizon 5 as well, I didn't test that game as much but it had even more issues than 4. Probably could be comperable with more tinkering though since it's the same engine. 

Please do not believe the posts on reddit saying this game is perfectly playable on high settings at 50fps. Performance is all over the place and you will almost never get a stable frame rate no matter what settings you use and what FPS you lock it to. I use the medium dynamic preset locked at 40FPS, GPU clock manually set to 1600, and increased my UMA frame buffer to 2 gigs, and stuttering and frame drops are still constant. Increasing the frame buffer to 4 gigs did help but it made the Deck run 10 degrees hotter and the fans were on high constantly. Not to mention higher battery drain. This also didn't make the stutters go away, just slightly less frequent and slightly better frame timing. 2Gigs seems to provide an okay boost in performance without much noticeable downside. It's possible that a 16gig swap file helps performance but that's past where I draw the line for tinkering steps and I don't think it would help the crashing. 

And that's the bigger problem, the crashing. On every available version of Proton on steam, the game crashes quite often during loading screens. It hasn't ever crashed during a race which is a slight positive, but driving 5 miles to a race only to have it crash so you have to drive that 5 miles again can be irritating. Crashes after races also happen but it seems to save your progress before the crash so that's not as bad as it could be.  Using GE-Proton, the game doesn't seem to crash during loading screens, but it does crash during free roam driving, which is even more frustrating.

All in all this game is barely playable on Deck, and if you can help it I'd really avoid it until if and when a proton fix comes along. These issues also prevail in Horizon 5, so hopefully these games are on the radar for getting fixes, assuming it's even possible to fix them in the first place.

The only reason I keep playing is when it works well, it's fantastic, and no other racing game that's playable on deck comes close to the horizon experience IMO.",0

1678,"At the start it's a fantastic game. It hooks you right in, opportunities come in, bells and whistles chime on with every bit that you do. Your senses are just constantly stimulated. 50 hrs in and it still brilliant, the Lego and fortune island DLCs are really well built. 

150 hrs in the end is stating to get in sight and slowly this creeping feeling starts to come in that now it's becoming a grind. Started playing some PVP and all of a sudden I started hating it. Players push and shove, even go out of the way to kick you off course. Small mistakes like bumping into a wall are met with a slow down penalty - I'm slowed down already by the accident I'm involved in and the game goes on adding 10 seconds of you moving to a crawling 50mph.

200hrs most achievements are done. Nothing else is being announced. The late game shrouded in a saddening silence. And then the kicker - after all those hours you realise that the game is broken. It cannot be completed. I've checked the developers notes for known bugs. The page is 6 months old https://support.forzamotorsport.net/hc/en-us/articles/360001991068-FH4-Known-Issues

The current players have little to no hope that the game will be fixed ever, shunning Microsoft for lack of care for a game that is still sold a full price 4/5 years later. I was lucky enough to get it on a sale period. Abandonment of this game is eminent. The current announcements are now on a loop. There isn't any more involvement of the MS team caring for the game.

250hrs enjoying the last few crumbs of what is left to do. The superstar cards needed a bit of polishing, but it is evident now that the players don't care enough to get that far either. I've spent hours driving about whilst waiting for a Ranked drift adventure, never happened. The creative card is a poor attempt at sharing new creations. Good idea in concept - but a rapidly ageing one. Now its just a grind fest of sharing and unsharing pictures, car mods, liveries, and blue print tracks. Its not racing any more. I'd rather go do unpaid overtime work than this.

Its a shame. This game and its community have been let down so drily, unceremoniously, abandoned, as MS develops the next money grabbing title. The game is worth while, but the late game part is just disappointing. I, like many others will get stuck at 99% achievement completion. It is ironically fitting that the last achievement is called 'Encore?' with  a question mark, because I think I know the answer for that one. 

No

There won't be

Edit: The 'FH4 Known Issues' page has been updated with the following remark: ""Latest Nvidia driver causing game to Freeze/Crash (updating to studio driver or rolling back driver solves this issue) [12.1.22] Nvidia Drivers"" - Meaning you can't play the game properly unless you have old Nvidia Drivers. Wonderful, just wonderful ",0

1680,"It is an excelent game with excelent graphical capabilities. It has mostly different kinds of settings for controls which allows you to play as it is an simulator or make it so easy that even a todller could play it. Also, it is compatible with steering wheels like g25-27-29 and etc. Aditionally it has vast varienty of cars and car brands that you maybe have heard. Some of them are really ridiculous in a good way and some of them are fun to drive. I think if you buy this game on sale it would worth the money. If it was me, and it was not on sale i would buy Forza horizon 5 as it has more of what forza horizon 4 has and also i would buy forza horizon 5 because it has more player playing it.",1

1701,"Forza Horizon 4 is a great racing game that I feel ends up leaving you overwhelmed. While mechanically speaking, it is a great game, it's beautiful, and it runs well, there's a lot thrown at you that left me uninterested in the end. I'm kind of on the fence about reviewing this game because I feel so conflicted about it. Would I recommend it? Yes, while it's on sale.

First, let's go with the good. The driving mechanics are phenomenal. All the cars feel great. Whether you're driving a dirt track or a road track, it all feels awesome. You could potentially spend hundreds of hours in this game playing with all sorts of cars. In fact, the game scales to whatever car you want. Want classic cars? All the cars in the field will be the same class as you and also be classic cars. Want to race the fastest exotic cars? The race will change to have all exotic cars so everyone is on a level playing field. You can race exotic cars in dirt races, rally cars on road races, however you want to do it. Obviously exotic cars will feel slippery on dirt tracks but all the cars still have that great balance between arcade-y and sim racers.

The game is also gorgeous. It runs buttery smooth. I never noticed an issue with frame rates or graphical bugs. The game simply runs and looks great. I see a lot of reviews for crashing but I personally never had the game crash. The one strange bug is probably very unique and won't even affect most of you. If I played a game in SteamVR, closed SteamVR, and then eventually launched Forza Horizon 4, my controller wouldn't register. I always had to restart my PC after finishing a VR session. Very strange and very unique. If you don't even play VR, it obviously won't be an issue for you.

My issue with the game however is the progression and the fact that they just throw so much at you at all times. When you finish a race, listen to the AI talk to you about new events in the map! Oh, you don't care? Too bad, sit here throughout the conversation until we tell you you can play again. Every event you finish seems to trigger 3 or 4 more new events that the game wants to tell you about. The game is also open world. So when you unlock a new event, you can't just jump into it. You have to drive to the destination to start it. It seems like unnecessary busy work. I just want to race, not drive to a place in order to race. 

The progression also seems strange. I got the game at a steep discount and ended up going with the Ultimate Edition to get the DLCs. I'm glad I did because it also came with a bunch of free cars. The cars you buy with in game currency is so expensive you'll be racing a ton of races in the same car just to afford a new one. With the Ultimate Edition, I had access to a lot of free cars which didn't really hurt me but I shouldn't have to pay for the Ultimate Edition to feel like I can progress at a proper pace.

There's a lot of down time in Forza Horizon. Whether it's listening to the AI talk to you or driving from race to race, between the actual races. Racing games are a genre where I always try to 100% them, finishing first in every event, but I just couldn't be bothered with this one since it's so overwhelming with how much there is to do and how much downtime there is between each event. 

Did I enjoy playing the game? Yes. Mechanically and visually, the game is amazing. But there are a lot of strange design choices to try to keep you playing when it ended up pushing me away from more. Would I recommend it? Yes, but at a discount. I had fun for the time I did put into the game but I ended up putting it away earlier than I would have thought I would going in.",1

Show off races, story chapters, stunts chapter, forza horizon festival events, arcade game events and what not?

Gamplay is so smooth and you have way more control for cars. the settings r best. even a noob can play this game easily haha. 

If u r more of explorer try searching for the hidden cars or smash some bill boards or just enjoy the beauty of the game by finding the best spot of maps. still not enough? want to share what u saw? This game camera setting for screenshots are the best. lots of varitaion and filters it so satsfying . even i can be a photographer hahaha.

As for the crict, i have just 1 critic STOP GIVING CARS with every wheelspin. it miss the concept of grinding and buying the best car for yourself. wheelspins are good but they give away car waayy too often. it sucks since i like to work hard for a car i want. 

overall you can never get enough of this game. and yeah not to mention dialogues are entertaining too in cutscene or on calls.

Im not joking when I say that besides the map seeming less diverse than the forza horizon 5 map, I really dont see where anything can be improved, it just that good. I really didnt think this would be the game I got addicted to, but its just so fun and rewarding, I feel like anyone could pick it up and at least have a good time collecting cars and driving around the open world.",1

The customer service was not willing to refund the money. If I bought the luxury version, it would be equivalent to spending one-half more money, but in that case, it would be better to add 50 as to buy Horizon 5. However, I really like the ultimate version. No one's money is blown by the wind, and I don't want to spend more money.

If you eat the cake, there's another free cake inside.

If you breath normally for more than 2 minutes during your walk, you get a free cake for each second you were breathing.

If you cross the street, you get a free cake, and if you don't cross the street, you also get a free cake.

If you take the bus after your walk, you get a cake the size of a bus with other many cakes inside.

Imagine all of that but instead of cakes you have cars. That's Forza Horizon 4.

1840,"This is the first Forza I've played, the last one I've played beeing NfS Heat. Well, I can give you a little tl;dr in advance: its so much better than NfS heat in any way^^

Firstly, there is way more variety in the stuff you can do. There are different Party games, offroad, onnroad, a mixture off both, drag, showoffs, liveevents, campaign missions, pr stunts and track building.
Also there is a nice endgame with weekly challenges where you have to use different vehicles every time.
Other than NfS the AI actually is fun to race against and can really pose a challenge (mine were at Pro at the end, where I got a perfect mix of won races and races where I got beaten).

Behind the scenes is a crazy amount of simulation for the people who are interested (not me, but its still cool), you can see camber, tire pressure, tire tenperature and lots of more stuff I've never heared off)

There is also a lot of variety in the music, with many different music styles like rock, electrobic, pop, classic etc. All the songs are played via the radio which is a bice way to immerse the music into the game. The music and voicelines can get a bit repetetive though, so you better switch up the radio station every few hours.
Graphics are phenomenal, and you can set the FPS higher than 60 FPS which is great (not that I would reach more than about 80 at 4K Ultra settings ;P).
One thing about graphics that I don't like is the ultrawide support. Often you have black bars, some times even on all 4 sides of the screen. Luckily I switched to my TV anyways because this is a controller game, which is just so much more fun on a big TV screen :D.

Now let's get to the stuff I didn't like:
It crashes from time to time, especially when retrying campaign missions, where it loads for a minute and spawns you underneath the map. Also there are Ads, long unskippable video telling you to buy more ingame content. They disappear after the ""story"" is through, but are still pretty annoying. Also I wish I could choose my starting position, for B races, which you have to do in the weekly challenges sometimes, its almost impossible to win on short tracks, if you start at 10/12 or 8/12. (I think its bound ro drivatar difficulty, but I'd like to change that independantly)

Tuning and designing is great, with some crazy community designs, but I wish you could choose to not apply a design after buying a car. Now i have to buy the car, chose a design, go to the design manager and remove it again. Also selling cars not via auction would be great.

All in all I can say: phenomensl game, so much fun, so much variety, so good lucking, 10/10 would buy again.",1

1901,"As someone who has grown up playing a lot of Need for speed, this game is a huge upgrade in many ways. Sure, you lose the story and cops element of need for speed, but in return you get so much more content. It really shows that Microsoft is a much more interested in their player-base as compared to EA. This is probably the best instalment out of every horizon game.",1

1908,"Forza Horizon 4 is an amazing, anecdotal and extensive game with a class of formidable technical excellence!

The dynamic transfiguration of the stations is a differential that further complements the immersive capacity and the contents available to glimpse.

From beginner to newbie, and I guarantee you'll have the best experience possible from the series. :D",1
1909,Very very good game,1
1910,"You don't need anyone's opinion on how good this game is. Nevertheless, this is a great recipe for an amazing caramel custard pudding for you to enjoy while you admire Great Britain -

Ingredients -
1. 1/2 cups sugar
2. 6 large eggs
3. 3 cups whole milk
4. 2 teaspoons vanilla extract

1. In a large heavy saucepan, cook and stir 3/4 cup sugar over low heat until sugar is melted and golden. Pour into eight 6-oz. custard cups, tilting to coat the bottom of each cup; let stand for 10 minutes.
2. In a large bowl, beat the eggs, milk, vanilla, and remaining sugar until blended but not foamy. Pour over caramelized sugar.
3. Place the cups in two 8-in. square baking pans. Pour very hot water in pans to a depth of 1 in. Bake at 350¬∞ until a knife inserted in the center comes out clean, 40-45 minutes. Remove from pans to cool on wire racks.
4. To unmold, run a knife around the rim of the cup and invert onto the dessert plate. Serve warm or chilled.
5. Enjoy!",1

6. Sende blijnidir mende dalnidir(Meyxana- deyiwme)",1

Xbox players got this game 3 years ahead of PC players, but this game is still relevant, with great graphics and it is very fun to play. 
It has tons of content: starting with over 700 cars to choose from, over 100+ race courses, plus bunch of fun activities such as drifting, jumping and ""speed zones"". On top of that it has quite a few ""stories"" that allow you to explore different cars that you might not be your first choice. 
And the best part is the customisation and online content. If you want the best tune is S1 class, or best looking car - you don't need to spend hours trying to craft it, you can just search what other players created and download it in 3 clicks. After a while, as you get better at tuning or designing, you can share your tunes/designs with the rest of the players!",1

If you're unsure about starting racing games then i whole heartly recommend starting here, the game is very welcoming to new players and if youre motivated you'll definitly get really good at it (or you can just ram all the bots if you want to play easierly, the game doesn't judge lol.)",1

Some animals you can attempt to run over (But they hold very mighty power so Be aware...)
All of the V10 Engined Cars are done Majestically (Driving the Lexus LFA is sort of a life-changing experience)
There are massive amounts of Hills you can do glorious jumps over
The AI difficulty isnt Insanely hard

Depende del vehiculo que cojais vereis que el agarre no es el mismo asi como la estacion del ano y meteorologia del momento, y respecto a la progresion, despues de un par de horas jugando ves la de cosas que tienes para hacer y como vas a ir desbloqueando otras.

Si os gustan los coches (aun no siendo fanaticos de ellos) o los juegos de conduccion, este Forza Horizon 4 os va a volver locos. Yo no soy super fan de los juegos de competicion pero este tiene una mezcla entre mundo libre para ir con tus coches por donde quieras y multitud de carreras y desafios de muy distintos tipos (rutas, rally, carretera, campo...) para competir.

Respecto a los vehiculos, es una locura todos los que hay. Si ademas obtienes la version ultimate tendras unos cuantos desbloqueados para adquirirlos gratis, ademas de multitud de DLCs).

Ir con un M5 dando una vuelta o competir contra otra gente en tiempo real con un TT no tiene precio. Ademas uno de los modos online que tiene (que no he hablado de ellos) es un battle royale, en el que el circulo se va cerrando y tienes que ir mejorando de coche para derrotar en carreras a los demas contrincantes. Es bastante divertido y a mi no me divierten los battle royale en exceso, pero este esta entretenido.

I will say the designers and the challenges probably need some UI tweaks for future games, because I really like the complexity in car designs, but I just want to create things easily, not with as much fiddling as currently required. 

All in all, great game for racing, exploration and just customising what you want, from challenges to cars. 10/10",1

So, the game has a dynamic change of day and night, as well as seasons, players can meet other players on the tracks of ""their"" world. There are over 450 unique vehicles available in Forza Horizon 4.

Weather and seasons, in turn, greatly affect the gameplay - for example, on wet roads, cars behave unpredictably, which complicates control. Also, depending on the season, different game modes become available, including off-road, circuit racing and drifting. Also, players can improve and customize their cars in every possible way to stand out among many other racers.",1

2072,fun driving game,1
2073,"        First of all, I would like to say that as an American, I NEVER thought I would own this game, given that all the driving is done on the left side of the road, not the right side. I thought it would be a bit difficult to get used to it. My thought was correct, and it did take a while to get accustomed to driving on the left side. Once you've gotten past this, you have several things to enjoy:

A large map to explore (About 10 x 10 miles)

Plenty (as many as 420+) of cars to drive and tune to your liking

Fantastic optimization (I am literally running the game at 30-40 FPS medium graphics with an Intel Core I5 4th Gen Processor, GeForce GT1030, and 16 GB of RAM) In other words, you can run this game on a potato

A splendid sim-cade (Simulation Arcade) driving system, where the handling feels like a mix of sim-racing and arcade driving games.

Beautiful overall visuals (once again I am basically running it on a potato)

And So. Many. Damned. Races. You don't have to grind. The game gives you money. I could go on and on about how I have not had to do much of anything and was able to buy my favorite car during the first thirty minutes of gameplay. But, like every game, FH4 has its downsides.

Odd stuttering issues (they seem like a CPU Usage issue, which I can't do anything about, it's NOT the game's fault) 

Occasional issues loading stuff in (again, probably my computers problem, not the games problem)

Atrocious Force Feedback issues (Using a Gear/Cog driven wheel, I'm guessing that its the wheel at fault) Force feedback causes the wheel to sort of click (or feel as if it is being smashed and broken to oblivion) as the FFB does it's thing.

The Traffic AI are at the top of the ""Stupid-Ass Video Game NPCs and AI"" list. I followed the traffic around on the highway for a bit and not only did they crash into each other, they kept switching lanes for no reason at all, and completely neglect to look on either side when doing so, resulting in the crash of the player car as well.

So yes, I do recommend the game, seeing that all but one of the issues in the cons section are probably my own or my hardware's fault. But, I do strongly recommend buying the Ultimate Edition of the game when it goes on sale, free cars, credit bonuses, stuff like that. Do I know that Forza Horizon 5 has been released? Yes. Do I still recommend Forza Horizon 4? Well duh, its still a great game, buy it before the Devs take it away from the stores!

2078,yes,1
2079,"Playing this game for the first time, on the very first drive, it instantly put a smile on my face!!!! Not much that i dislike, its very fun, and theres always something to do!!! Not only that but this is one of the most smoothest running games iv'e ever played!!!! Its fun to experiment with cars and tune them to my liking. Also, its nice to play a chill driving game for once, unlike ""Grand theft auto 5"" you have total freedom and don't have to worry about that much nor are other players a problem, which is something i look for in a game. Also, theres TONS of cars and car brands to choose from and many paint jobs, you can even make your own! The one thing i don't like is you do need patience for when you unlock a new race mode because it automatically pauses you and goes right to the map, plus the talking from characters does get a little annoying, but its not a huge deal in the end. Also, i know this game is mainly for controllers, but just on my keyboard the controls are easy to get down. Performance wise, i get about 54-60 fps, this is running on an AMD ryzen 5 2500 U and Vega 8 graphics, originally i was playing with 12 gig ram, with no issues before i upgraded my ram to 32 gig. But anyway my laptop is about 3 years old, so if your laptop about that old and has decent ram and a decent processor it should run well. Also i noticed little to no lag at all, again a very smooth running game, the only place i notice a small lag spike is during the camera panning around your car while your in the garage, but its not a big deal. Would i recommend this game? Well if you like cars, drifting, enjoying the countryside while going 240 MPH, then I'd say i'd recommend it!",1

2129,One of the GREATEST GAMES I'VE PLAYED!!!!!,1
2130,"(28.12.2021) Great place to spend your free time.
I bought the deluxe edition after the Steam release. I recommend taking it (especially on sale only for $30), because it contains many exclusive cars that perform well in their class. My impressions are amazing. It is very relaxing, will not let you get bored (many different races, network modes and more) and will not force you to farm on cars - they will ""accumulate"" in the garage themselves. I liked the physics - almost everything on the map is interactive; graphics and optimization at height; large car garage; change of seasons. There are also 2 DLC‚Äôs with original maps.

According to reviews, the edition in Steam is more buggy than in MS.
Very disappointed with the network mode with its bugs, 10-minute ""fast"" movement, departures from the network mode, issue that can‚Äôt connect to Xbox live servers... 

And if we talk about it.. why we need to connect our Steam account to Xbox account? Then what is the advantage of the fucking Steam version?

There is no simple chatting with others (because it‚Äôs olny 4 customized prepeared answers), no in-campaing team-racing (because it‚Äôs impossible to find just a 3-men race, I don‚Äôt know why). 

Game have a well music, but IT CAN‚ÄôT BE fully turned off. It boring every time you have a race loading screen. The AI is bad, seriously, but only ‚Äúdrivatars‚Äù. NPC‚Äôs is also bad namely their animations and faces (it‚Äôs not a huge issue, it‚Äôs a racing game). From this we can understand that the game has a not-offensive kid friendly athmosphere and it is nasty.

In general offline game is pretty good, but online part not as good as we wanted. Devs not updating the game and don‚Äôt fixing this major issues they are engaged in disgusting FH5.",1

2134,"I gave it a thumbs up, but there is a BIG CAVEAT.

Pros: The racing and driving are really fun, the controls are fantastic, and it looks beautiful.

Cons: The game nags you constantly and will not shut the f--- up. Characters you don't care about are constantly talking to you even though you hate them and want them to shut up forever. The nags are so bad, they will completely interrupt you no matter what you're doing. You could be in mid-air in the middle of a sweet jump and suddenly the game pauses and takes you to a screen where a person you don't care about talks to you for five minutes about a thing you don't care about. Sometimes you just wanna open the map for one sec to set a checkpoint, but as soon as you open the map, some guy you don't care about takes away your controls and starts explaining all of the map icons to you like you're moron who has never heard of a video game before, or---I kid you not---it will sometimes interrupt you in the middle of driving to show you an unskippable COMMMERCIAL. You have no choice but to suffer ongoing psychic damage as you endure every inescapable moment of this. You can't turn any of this off or skip it. Even if you go into the options and turn notifications off, you will still---for some reason---receive them. I can't stress enough how annoying it is.

The driving is really good and fun, but the constant notifications and ads and online bullsh-- are so ungodly constant and annoying that it's barely worth it. It's enough to persuade me to NOT buy forza horizon 5.",1

2144,"This isn't so much my opinion of the game itself, more so about the hoops and red tape you have to get through just to get past the title screen.  After playing the demo, from the MS store, I was looking forward to a decent racing game for my G920 that wasn't super realistic, but still fun.  But i couldn't even get past the title screen with the stupid MS account link nonsense.  I don't like the whole process of having to sign in to another account, especially when i don't use it that often, and to my dismay, the game had a problem with my MS account and would not give me the option to re-enter my info, in the off-chance i mis-typed something.  Just the good ole ""There was a problem with your MS account"" error every single time i click the ""sign-in"" button on the xbox popup window.  But i didn't have a single problem when i first launched Halo: Infinite last week, so WTF?  None of the supposed solutions i came across did anything for me, so this game is going back into the void.  I really despise games that don't let you even start the game without verifying your DOB, phone number, mother's maiden name, and the name of the 4th grade teacher you hated when you were a kid.  Just let me play the damn game i paid for!",0

2188,"10/10 would go muddin' in a 2014 Lamborghini Hurac√°n LP 610-4 again

I love the open world and the plethora of race types. It's cool to see other people online driving around in the same world while not being forced to interact/race with them. Perfect for any introvert who enjoys people watching but doesn't like to be noticed.

This is the racing experience perfect for me. I can drop in for as much or as little time I want/have and it has a truly enjoyable open world to navigate. This will be the game that scratches the itch for a good racing game for a while to come for me unless/until Forza Horizon 5 gets a bigger discount.

EDIT:

Also, I wanted to add that the rewind system is implemented really well in this game. My first exposure to this was in Grid 2 which if I remember correctly limited you to 3 rewinds a race, this game allows you as many as you need (I haven't raced online). It's a nice feature to experiment with how you'd take a certain corner or section of a race. I love that I can rewind both in a race and out in the open world.",1
2189,haha open world racing go brr,1
2190,"This is the best racing game I have ever played. I played almost all the major racing game series except the CREW 
NFS, GRID, Burnout, Trackmania, Driveclub, BLUR... I try to remember the last time I had that much fun playing a racing game but I honestly don't remember. Old GRID game might be second best and BLUR might be the third one but this game is number one for sure.

First of all, the game never gets repetitive ever. Even if you play nonstop for the entire day, you can still find an exciting goal to achieve. Another race, another car to buy, houses, multiplayer, so much thing. The experience differ all the time so you never get bored.

Cars feel different and level matching AI is perfectly tuned. McLaren Senna has the fastest and the most controllable car I had so far but even with that car, your opponents are perfectly matched. So you never grind too much and overkill. Even with the more fun but less controllable cars like Lambo Huracan, you don't feel like you need a better car. You feel like you need to perform better to win. This is an impossible thing to achieve but the opponents are perfectly tuned and game reminds you to set the difficulty higher as you develop your skills. 

I have never seen a racing game with such a beautiful winter map. The snow looks incredible. I guess the last time I have seen a winter map that feels like it is Max Payne 1. Of course, every other season feels amazing but winter was my favourite. 

The car variety is mind blowing. 

There is so much thing to appreciate. I can't even remember all of it.",1

2245,"A fantastic arcade driving video game.

Imagine this - you arrive on a God forsaken wasteland known as Britain and participate in fast paced movement high speed events while trapped in a steel deathbox. Traversing this roadless post apocalyptic land is made easy, due to game providing you with over 700 unique vehicles, most of which for some reason sound exactly the same.  

The best part of the game is that it covers pretty much every driving style you'd want in this type of game. You can be a regular racist, a street racist, offroad racist, dirty racist, sideways racist, even a lego racist. Then switch up and do some speed traps or speed zones, where you just need to go fast through a point or a zone. Take out your waifu covered van and go jump off a ramp to set a high score or participate in user created mini events, most of which are basically go fast on the highway in the same fast red car. 

Also since it's the current year, this game has a battle royale mode, which is surprisingly well made for a car based video game. I hate it.

Eventualy you become a superstar racist, which translated from Britbongistani language, means you get a free paper wristband. That's pretty much it, the ultimate reward for the story.

If for some reason you grow bored of the badlands of ""UK"", there are two DLCs with new regions. Fortune Island and Lego Speed Champions. While Fortune Island is basically the same thing as mainland, but with a bigger mountain, the Lego DLC is one of the best things added to a video game. It's an island built mostly of legos, which looks fantastic and allows me to outrace sweaty tryhards in their Hotwheels cars, while in a Lego car.

With the pistol on my hip like I'm a cop (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Have you ever met a real nigga rockstar?
This ain't no guitar, bitch, this a Glock (woo)
My Glock told me to promise you gon' squeeze me (woo)
You better let me go the day you need me (woo)
Soon as you up me on that nigga, get to bustin' (woo)
And if I ain't enough, go get the chop
It's safe to say I earned it, ain't a nigga gave me nothin' (yeah, yeah)
I'm ready to hop out on a nigga, get to bustin'
Know you heard me say, ""You play, you lay, "" don't make me push the button
Full of pain, dropped enough tears to fill up a fuckin' bucket
Goin' for buckets, I bought a chopper
I got a big drum, it hold a hundred, ain't goin' for nothin'
I'm ready to air it out on all these niggas, I can see 'em runnin'
Just talked to my mama, she hit me on FaceTime
Just to check up on me and my brother
I'm really the baby, she know that her youngest son
Was always guaranteed to get the money (okay, let's go)
She know that her baby boy was always guaranteed to get the loot
She know what I do, she know 'fore I run from a nigga, I'ma pull it out and shoot (boom)
PTSD, I'm always waking up in cold sweats like I got the flu
My daughter a G, she saw me kill a nigga in front of her before the age of two
And I'll kill another nigga too
'Fore I let another nigga do somethin' to you
Long as you know that, don't let nobody tell you different
Daddy love you (yeah, yeah)

And if I ain't enough, go get the chop
Keep a Glocky when I ride in the Suburban
'Cause the codeine had a young nigga swervin'
I got the mop, watch me wash 'em like detergent
And I'm ballin', that's why it's diamonds on my jersey
Slide on opps' side and flip the block back, yeah, yeah
My junior popped him and left him lopsided, yeah, yeah
We spin his block, got the rebound, Dennis Rodman
You fool me one time, you can't cross me again
Twelve hundred horsepower, I get lost in the wind
If he talkin' on the yard, the pen' dogs'll take his chin
Maybach SUV for my refugees
Buy blocks in the hood, put money in the streets
I was solo when the opps caught me at the gas station
Had it on me, thirty thousand, thought it was my last day
But they ain't even want no smoke (no smoke)
If I had to choose it, murder what she wrote

But still, Forza Horizon 4 is the best outstanding visual style game you'll ever play in your low and mid range PC. It's so perfectly optimized that, there's barely any frame drop or lag. From game-play to sound, from stunning graphics to story series, you'll love it. Just buy the 'Ultimate Edition' in sale and you won't regret it. Even if you can't buy the Ultimate Edition, just buy the 'Standard Edition' on sale and thank me later. Ciao",1

The picture quality can almost reach the next generation. There are a wide variety of vehicles, the map is large and exquisite, and the vehicle operation feel is very suitable for non hard core driving game players like me! However, the only regret of the Microsoft platform is that I can't connect to the online mode, only one person and man-machine racing. I hope this steam edition can make up for my regret, and the brainless Ultimate Edition will start",1

Game has a lot of customization options for the cars it offers. 10/10 would fit in a I4 Motorbike engine, in a Peel P50 IRL if I could. Game has occasional glitches and artifacts, but again those aren't game breaking as much as Forza Horizon 5. Soundtrack gets boring after a while, Spotify or local music player integration would've been great, sadly it was lost to the older ages. Its funny how almost all games in 2000's and 2010's had it in some form or the other, but modern titles lack it.",1

2398,"I have no regrets wasting so much time on this. It's been a long time since I got so much enjoyment out of a driving game.

Driving and drifting feels awesome. Just chilling on a long road in your car, occasionally breaking some signs is amazing. Original map along with both expansions look great and have some stunning scenery. Changing seasons are a nice touch. Not enough falling leaves on autumn though.

Alas car customization is far from perfect only having couple new bumpers or a spoiler. That's definitely not enough for me comparing with a hundred years old Underground 2. You also don't really have any kind of progression here as you'll get a lot of hypercars after half an our of playing. No journey to the top here, sadly. The menus are a mess to navigate through and I can't count how many times I queued up for eliminator instead of changing a car.

Also the multiplayer is full with crying fragile children trying to do everything to throw you off the track and spamming ""Eat dirt!"" even in cooperative races.

Exploring the map though is quite a pleasure, even if the radio has only three songs all of which are remixes of one.",1

2422,"Overall fun game, but the fairly constant advertisements for in game purchases is extremely annoying. If the game was free you can advertise, but not when you charge full price. G29 support on this game isn't great, even old titles like Gran Turismo 4 feel more real with a steering wheel. This game was clearly designed for controller and you can really feel it with a wheel. 

Whoever decided to constantly advertise DLC inside a full-price game should be fired and publicly shamed.",1
2423,"Also played The Crew 2 for 50+ hours. FH4 has better driving mechanics, overall graphics quality, audio detail and event variety; however the map is not even close to The Crew 2's one in terms of size and decoration. Here in Forza you only get to drive in countryside, there are too few and very small urban areas whereas in The Crew 2 you have the entire United States. If you want to explore a vast open world using different kinds of vehicles (planes, boats, bikes...) go with TC2 and if you want a better driving experience choose FH4. Personally I enjoy them both, but FH4 feels slightly more like my cup of tea",1
2424,"I had a great time playing this game! Since I got FH5, I thought to myself that I'm actually sorry for FH4. This game showed me how the 1 driving expirience should feel. I hope you agree with me...",1

- Graphics
- Optimisation for PC

- London
- Legos
and the list goes on

Basically this is a must have if you like cars and want to drive them like a madman on the streets which you basically can't in real life. All in all - a solid experience. I still have tons of stuff to do and I keep coming back for more.  Eagerly waiting for the next part !",1
2465,"I mean, it's a pretty late review, but [b]Forza Horizon 4[/b] is amazing nonetheless. If you like racing games it's a must-have: it obviously [i]isn't[/i] a racing sim, it's more arcade-y than its [b]Forza Motorsport[/b] counterpart but it does hit good levels of realism through car tuning and the great graphics that run beautifully [i]even on older hardware[/i]. Plus Photo Mode is such a fantastic feature.

It's loads of fun to play on both controller and wheel, but know that the latter [i]does require some fine-tuning[/i] in the settings (for things like [u]Force Feedback[/u] if your wheel supports it), which you can get done in a matter of seconds so it's hardly a drawback.

I would've bought this game a lot earlier if I knew what I was missing out on. It's indeed a great purchase, though it might be better to [b]pick it up on a discount[/b] rather than full price if you're keen on having the whole Forza line-up in your library, since [b]Forza Horizon 5[/b] is coming in a few weeks (looking even [i]nuttier[/i] than FH4).",1

2548,"Purchased this game and it is great when it works. However, I experience frequent crashes at irregular intervals. The game may crash 5 minutes after starting or after 2 hours. I have spent multiple hours attempting to fix this issue only to find that this has been an issue for years. Due to troubleshooting the game, I've surpassed the 2 hour limit for returns and Steam has denied my request for a refund after exhausting all options via Steams' own community hub and the internet.

This is the only Steam game that crashes, so I know it's isolated to Forza. 

With Forza Horizon 5 coming soon, I do not recommend this game and sadly am very wary of FH5. I absolutely love the game (minus the crashes) but cannot in good faith recommend it to anyone.

2552,l really enjoyed the off-road racing events. The Road and Street racing events could defo use some punching up. Or maybe just a better organisation and presentation (my new player experience with them wasn't so great). Not entirely sure. Overall I think this has probably become my favourite racing game for now.,1
2553,"As a former Gran Turismo player, I absolutely love Forza so far. While the Forza Horizon series (I never played Forza Motorsport) still belongs to arcade racing, it reaches a perfect balance between arcade and realistic racing. It has a fair amount of reality, while players can still jump right in anytime, unlike car sim titles where people must spend time learning mechanics and control methods before they can play properly. This is the unique character of Forza Horizon and its greatest charisma in my opinion. I don't recommend the steam version when it comes to using a steering wheel, as I've had some issues with it already. 

So far I am really enjoying FH4. I bought the Ultimate edition as it's on sale right now. Even though its a little more expensive I do recommend getting it if it's on sale. As it's just getting the most out of this game for a cheaper price.",1
2554,I love it,1
2555,"When I first bought and launched the game on Steam, it was stuttering constantly (I already had the game on MS Store and there was no problems at all). But after couple of months they finally fixed the problem and now the game is running very smoothly. So, about the game itself:
[h1]Pros:[/h1] excellent graphics, a large map with many interesting places (+two DLC, which are also awesome), good optimization (except the unpleasant case), a large number of vehicles.
[h1]Cons:[/h1] A very mediocre soundtrack, in the previous games the soundtrack was MUCH better. In both competitive and casual game modes, there are no D or C classes. I understand that it's unlikely that someone would choose them, because who wants to ride on slow cars, if there's A/S1/S2. But driving through the forest or mountains (especially in the winter) in the S2 class is also quite stupid. Lack of any hardcore mode with all assistants turned off and damage on for all players. I remember the moment when in the FH 1 someone turned on the damage simulation and at the very first corner almost half of the players left after critical damage to their cars (and this looked very cool, because not only mirrors/spoilers/number plates could be destroyed, but also the front and rear bumpers and even the front wheels.
Overall, $15 for Ultimate Edition is more than worth it.
[h1]UPD:[/h1] The game has crashed several times already (25 hours played), stutter still appears from time to time, MP matchmaking is working weird (I just keep disconnecting from MP sessions for no reason). I would recommend to buy this game from MS Store.",1

[H1]So what's it about?[/H1]
Do you remember when you were younger and played Need for Speed II or Hot Pursuit with your friends (or maybe it‚Äôs just me getting old :p)? Forza Horizon 4 brings back that feeling but comparing it to NFS II would be a great injustice: hundreds of cars, there are so many activities to do, you can race in LEGO cars and the visuals are just beautiful. As you may understand it's my first Forza game and I'm just stunned by how good it is :-)

[H1]The good[/H1]
The visuals are some of the most impressive in any game I've played so far. The weather effects are so realistic and the level of detail is just another level. Of course, it would be boring if they replicate the whole country but still the regions that were selected are recognizable (I've been to most of the areas :-)). There are so many cars to pick from and you can modify them to your hearts' content. Almost every race can be completed with different cars so most of the time the game doesn't force you to use a particular type of car. I love that on the map you see other players and there are many online activities as well. And then we talk about optimization: it's unbelievable how well the game runs. There are many options available to adjust the difficulty so it makes it a game for everyone (except if you are into super realistic racing games). 

Then there is the auction house where you can buy rare cars, barn finds where you can find them and competitions where you can earn even more. There is so much to do I was never bored at all. Even after completing the game, it will stay on the PC to scratch that racing itch. 

You can buy a castle: do I need to say more :-)

The LEGO DLC is really good: it offers so much value and it so much fun to play :-). It is my favourite part of the game.

There a so many achievements: some are a bit tedious but it's a great way to discover more in the game. I haven‚Äôt completed them all as I have been playing Forza for four weeks straight but I will definitely come back in a few weeks or months.

If I have to pick one car it would be the Hoonigan Ford Escort RS 1800: it just a beast and will take just about anything you throw on it. However, there are over 700+ other cars to choose and with the ability to make designs and share them with others you will always have a unique car that suits your skills and experience best. 

[H1]The not so good[/H1]
Avoid the version on Microsoft Store and buy the Steam edition instead: I had so many problems with the Microsoft Store it is just not funny. Some people might find Forza not so realistic but that is not what it pretends to be. What bothered me were the replays: why can't I place camera's along the track and build a cool replay? 
And then we have the Playground games: CTF etc. works fine in FPS but in a racing game is just silly and not interesting or exciting at all. Some of the challenges like the photo one is quite tedious. I know, I know I don't have to do them but my OCD kills me if I don't ;-).

There are some bugs that stop progress: it seems the Star Cards are the most buggy - one of the challenges can't be completed in the current state (to have your businesses generate 2M). 

[H1]Summary[/H1]
I've been playing racing games since Test Drive I. This is the best racing game I have ever played. I highly recommend it even if you only have a slight interest in racing.

The game is very engaging because you can do anything with your car at any time you can tune it to go faster or do some nice drifts, by playing the game you can get some wheelsipns that drop cars, clothes, horn sounds, emotes, and the drops are ranked like legendary, common etc. The graphics are so so beautiful and realistic at times.

2-Even the game supports my steering wheel, the game doesn't recognize the wheel. I read a thread about it that they say if you have  microsoft store version, your steering wheel works well but if you have steam version, game doesn't recognize wheel. 
3- Also auction system is not refresh itself instantly, so you have to make an effort and have a luck to buy a car from auctions.
4- I can't turn off radio sounds volume. The most volume level I can lower down is 1, but I can still hear radio sounds.
5-(Rarely) When you are in race, half of your car sink into the ground or you have a fast car like Ferrari 599X Evo, its rear side sink into the road when you reach 200+ km/h speed.",1

i don't know if i'm bad at using a wheel or not because i cannot learn how to drive with a steering wheel in this game, it's hard to do some micro adjustment and so easy to slide out of control, would not recommend steering wheel for new players",1
2678,"One of the best racing games I've ever played. More arcade like than simulation as driving feels smooth and simple for anyone regardless of prior experience with racing games. You can customize your cars both inside and out. You can take something like an old clunker from the 80s or a van and turn it into something that can race against a modern lambo. You can paint your cars all kinds of colors and apply all kinds of designs, or you can pick from the thousands of liveries made by the community, some of which range from basic flame jobs and stripes, to memes and itasha.

Gameplay is set in a semi destructible open world in Scotland with races varying from street racing to offroad. You have a gigantic selection of cars like Nissans, Raris, Hummers, Chevys, etc. Cars are obtained pretty easily through events, leveling up, or buying them with in game currency obtained from playing. DLC cars are optional as most cars can be obtained through gameplay with only a few DLC exclusives as exceptions. There's also two DLC expansions that give you a creepy island to explore and a Lego themed world which are also good.

Overall I loved this game, and it's been the closest experience I could find to Gran Turismo 4 with even more stuff to do. Time flies fast for me whenever I play this and that's a good thing because this game never feels like it's dragging on for me. My only complaints are that the soundtrack is kind of bland and there's a few glitches, but nothing serious.

Recommend this if you want an easy to play racing game with a good challenge and tons of customization that won't bore you after only a couple of hours with it. 

Side Note: Yes, I did Itasha a lot of my cars if you're wondering.",1

2683,"I should probably preface this review by stating that [b] it's probably ""too late"" to get into this game now[/b] considering that the next game comes out this November. New content isn't coming to this game anymore, but it's still technically supported and reruns of old Seasonal Challenges are being done until 5's release. After that, who knows.

Next come this game's major flaws:
1. Bad, stupid AI that only remains competitive by using traction hacks. Increasing difficulty doesn't make them smarter, it gives them better traction hacks. Oh and the ""Trial"" event type forces you to race a team of AI on the highest difficulty with a team of your own composed of usually-quite-stupid players.

2. Bad, stupid meta and balancing where maybe a handful (25, maybe?) of this game's hundreds of cars are competitive in multiplayer against competent players. And it's only that much because there are different race types so it's more like 5 meta cars per race type. In addition, all of these cars have to be AWD swapped with specific engine swaps (usually) to be meta. No variety at all.

3. The main multiplayer mode, Online Adventures, is bad and stupid for a variety of reasons, not least being it only gives you races for a limited selection of car classes (usually A and S1, the 2nd and 3rd top classes so F you if you like slower classic cars) and at least in my case is also absolutely obsessed with giving you Cross Country events instead of street, race, or rally events.

4. In addition, those Cross Country events include a bad and stupid race type called ""Freeroam Rush"", which is basically being forced to drive from the finish line of the first real race to the start line of the second, desperately hoping you don't hit trees doing cross country at top speed. They're supposed to be a ""find your own route"" fun type of activity, but the fact that the rushes always start and end at the same place means you need to know the best route (which in some events means [i]turning 180 from the start position[/i]) or else you get DNF'd by the 30 second timer that starts as soon as the first guy finishes (who knows that route and finished way before you). Even more galling, they also include these events on Rally races and [i]used[/i] to include them on Street and Race events, despite those cars not being built for Cross Country or even offroading at all. They're the worst instance of terrible game design in the game, I think.

5. The environments in this game are very samey. Nearly the entire map apart from the roads is green farmland or fields flanked by brambles and trees, and split up by short stone walls (that at least act more like styrofoam when you ram through them, cause otherwise cross country would be impossible). They mix it up with an orange field flanked by rocks and some regions with a lot of trees, plus a mountain, a city, and a beach. There's also a pair of alternate zones locked to DLC, one of which is a recreation of the main map using LEGO and the other of which is an island with extremer weather. Next game is improving on this, though.

6. I don't personally have the right type of ear for this, so it's more of a your-mileage-may-vary criticism, but the engine sounds are apparently pretty trash. They're also making a big show of improving this in the next game, so at least there's that.


Now with 6 big issues you'd think this would be a negative review. And I guess this is where I complain about the lack of ""maybe"" as an answer for whether I recommend this game. Here's my conditions: seeing as I bought the game on sale and I feel like I've got my money's worth, I would recommend this game only if you don't mind the game being ""dead"", you can get it at a similarly discounted price that I did (40 bucks for the mid-grade edition), and the problems with the game don't bother you compared to what you can do.

Which is driving in an open world with a huge cast of cars, doing challenges and racing other people or the AI (again, provided you don't mind the problems with doing that last one).",1

I know and shut up, Forza Horizon 5 is beautiful and everyone knows, but you just said you are not planning to buy a better graphics card? Its basically the same game with same control and physics mechanics like previous Forza Horizon entry except with the beautiful graphics that you cant achieve on decent specs. Even this game still cost like ass, but ill bet you Forza Horizon 5 is gonna cost twice. Safe your buck and buy this one, even its still not perfectly un-optimized (recent update it fixed most) in steam version than windows, but its steam! It discounts regularly than greedy Microsoft store!

Things to keep in mind: This steam port is still having issues with steering wheel plug and play for most people, if you planning to buy just for steering wheel, buy the Microsoft store instead

Im using Logitech MOMO Racing, an old tech but clearly listed compatible, probably steam's shitty controller input setting you can try turning off see if it works (for some yes). For now, i dont wanna say they will fix anytime sooner...

Edit: Buy Forza Horizon 5, because their map design, vehicle sound design was improved alot, fuck this game, this poor game ain't gonna recieve any fixes",1

My only gripe is the advertisments when I go to play the game. I didn't pay money just to be slammed with un-skippable ad's. Thankfully it's a rare case for me and doesn't happen often.

2753,"Worth my money!
Overall is a fun experience, haven't tried the online races yet but the forzathon events are my always go-to if i want some multiplayer action.

Cannot judge its visual yet since i cannot play on highest settings without sacrificing lots of fps, but i play on medium and that is pretty much good and ballanced on that settings.

But still, i had some problems to point out:
1. The car still going full speed even if i did not accelerate it and it did not shows any sign of deacceleration, the only way to stop it are by crashing or pushing any of the brakes (or both) hard enough but this did not guarantee it would stop the car right away or made it deaccelerate

2. Sometimes the game freeze for no reasson (or the worst case which only happened once to me are all screen went black). For this one im not really sure is that my laptop specs issues or not because im still running with a single ddr4 3200mhz 8gb ram stick, my laptop has a pretty good CPU and GPU (R74800H and GTX1650 Ti) so those may not the case, during gameplay i only open discord on background (or sometimes spotify) so background activity not the case either. Thankfuly it could be stopped by simply quitting the game (alt+f4) and booting the game again, it does not happen occasionally. (In case of anyone wondering what laptop am i using, it is Asus Tuf A15 FX506II)

But despite of those problems i got, overall it is a fun experience and as i said before, worth my money",1

2777,"The game is in a perfect line between arcade and simulation. If you don't want to play simulation games or just bored of  arcade such as NFS and willing to be more realistic, here is the perfect choice. I bought the game in summer sales as Default Version but my advice is to buy it as Deluxe Edition since it literally has eveyr DLC and way cheaper than buying them seperately. DLCs add more hours to the already long gameplay and makes it even enjoyable and easier with the free cars you can get.
If you buy Default Version tho, I suggest you to buy Welcome Pack which will boost your starting hours very well. But don't worry, FH4 literally spams you cars every hour. I only played 6.7 hours while writing this review, I have been following the game since it's release, I got like 46 cars and I only paid money for 3 or 4 of them.
I suggest you to buy this game and play it with yout friends, don't worry the radio makes it enjoyable even though you are alone.",1
2778,Very good graphic. Waited this game to be on sales and finally got it,1
2779,yes.,1
2780,"This game is worth every cent. Best game ever! Realistic AF, works like butter!",1
2781,"If you  consider buying this game take a look at all the crashes people get. It is the same for me,  I play Assetto, Project Cars, Dirt Rally 1+2, WRC8, all without any issues. This game will just crash and there does not seem to be a fix, looks like the MS team is in denial about it, sounds familiar, doesn't it?

I will now contact FH4 support asking for a solution, if I don't like the answer I will refund this game immediately. I will not pay 44 ‚Ç¨ for a ""supreme edition"" which dies out on me in live races or joy riding the map.

Oh and one other thing. FFB settings suck too, if you are a keyboard slasher or a controller kiddie, feel free you gonna have a lot of fun. But for me, as a wheel head, this is not really optimal. 750 degrees instead of 900 degress, only small, not well explained options. The driving feels weird, like in races there are certain corners, you will always get trouble steering through, no matter what, feels like it is sort of ""programmed"". Also the breaking seems odd. You will get used to it, but it falls totally short compared to Dirt Rally or WRC8.

It shows that this is a game made for kids with useless sh*t like clothing for your avatar (which never leaves the car). Lengthy loading screens with your avatar in front of your car, dancing and sh*t. No wonder this game crashes, it is just unecessary and takes more time to load and fills up the buffer of your GFX card, just plain stupid.

The landscape is awesome, the variety of cars splendid, if it wouldn't crash I'd def. recommended it, but as of now my motto is ""HANDS OFF"". FH5 will be around the corner in november lets hope they learned from their mistakes. Well, probably not, there will be enough kids who will buy this for their xbox (where it does not crash, obviously).",0

This game runs like trash on most computers for no apparent reason. High-end PC's are struggling to get over 100fps in this game, and this somehow can not be fixed. After doing all the research I could online, I haven't found a single case that has been solved. The recommended and minimum system requirements for this game is completely inaccurate, I myself have above the recommended requirements to run this game but I can't reach a stable 60fps on lowest settings. This doesn't make sense to me.

If you have a top-notch PC, that can run every game on this planet with max settings and a stable framerate above 60, then this game would be great for you.",0

The game play is perfect for any person who loves car/racing games. Although this game is a literal do what ever you want, race who ever you want(except regular civilians), and drive whatever you want(except for tanks and larger/military vehicles including jets, bikes, and boats). I don't want to accept this but i have to let it out tho...There Are Still many bugs and glitches, that i honestly cant even comprehend, i have found so many within the city and in little towns even to this day there is like 20+ bugs and glitch i have found just surrounded by the map, anyway there aren't really any racing glitches, except for driving at a certain speed and just stopping instantly even within races but it doesn't bother me because IT IS VERY RARE TO HAPPEN, as in like less than .5% chance of happening because its never happened to me and i have been playing the game ever since it came out, and especially the other glitches surrounded by the map are actually ""FUNNY"", i find the glitches and bugs as another adventure looking for more and more ways to break the game, and its no bother to me so i suggest to fix the glitches that are some what messing up peoples games but keep the ones that are hard to find yet still funny in a way just to try and make people laugh and share with their friends :). That's really all i have to say and for anyone who has read till this end i suggest to stop what u r doing right now and try this game out, its free on Xbox live ultimate and make sure you have 100 GB worth of space because right now it takes i think like 50 plus something like that and there are still more updates to come and i'll leave the rest for you to find out :)",1

The first time I heard it I was a bit confused, thought I heard something wrong but a few mins later the A.I. GPS and other NPC's continued to refer to me by my real name. I love this feature.

The starting cutscene is something best to see first from your own experience, I'm not going to tell you anything but I 100% loved it.

-Car customisation is great. 
-Changing seasons and weather is amazing.

Cons:
-Stutters are such a pain (in Steam version) and borderline irritating.
-Drivatars are broken AF.  Their physics are broken. Drivatars magically jumps, respawns anywhere. They are not reset if they miss checkpoints. Corners don't slow them down especially at Pro and Unbeatable difficulty like they are stuck to road. And an Audi TT RS can beat Koenigsegg Agera in a drag race. Yes that much broken.
-Economy could be better. You can straight away get S and X rated supercars which I think should be based on level progression.

2856,"Admitted, the graphics is very nice, and I assume the number of cars (better: vehicles) is also amazing.
However, the game is very annoying. First time you start it, you have to go through a 5 minute intro 'race' to even get to the menu. Unskipable.
Then you come to a very limited menu, where not much can be done. You have to follow the 'gameplay' to enable things in the menu, which is very annoying. And interrupts the game play very often. One barely plays the game consistently, there's always something to interrupt. New menu options, new features, etc, all mid-drive, so while this runs, your car crashes into a wall in the background. Even ads for DLC packs. All unskipable. It's unbearable. Made me get a refund that Steam nicely rewarded (despite about 2.5h of playtime, I really DID want to like the game and thought these things would stop at some point).
Gameplay itself feels very (and I don't mean this disrespectfully) console game like. If you want a driving simulation, I did not find this the right game. Colin McRae, etc felt much more realistic, even 10 years ago (graphics aside, maybe, those really are amazing).

The game is also advertized as a open world driving game (e.g. like Test Drive Unlimited), but while this is technically 1, it really isn't. On the map, you can only set your navigation system to events, not random bits of the road, making going somewhere 'nice' pretty random. You basically have to just drive from one event to the next (and until just before I had enough there was always only one event available, so not even that you had a choice in), that's as 'open world' as it is.

The game also clearly isn't set up for a steering wheel. Options missing, steering is way too sensitive in the beginning. Even when turning it down, it's hard to drive in a straight line. Not even the steering angle you see on screen fits what you actually do. Force feedback on my steering wheel is laughable, and menus in the game still need to be used with a keyboard (or the settings are SO hidden that I didn't find them).

All in all, I expected MUCH more from this (quite hyped) game, but after 2.5h of the above, I have had enough and uninstalled it. Can't wait for Test Drive Unlimited Solar Crown.
If this was a star system, I'd give it 1 point for graphics and selection of cars. Nothing for the rest.",0

As a a gamer who has never had an Xbox, only played PlayStation and eventually PC, it was really nice to see that Forza Horizon 4 had come to Steam. This was definitely one of those exclusives I was like ' I wish that was on PlayStation'. I don't have much interest in racing as a sport or really in general but I do enjoy arcade-like racing in games, like Burnout Paradise, but I had to give this a try when it had made it's way to Steam. I know this franchise has a reputation and I was really eager to try it out (but not through Windows Store because no). I bought the Ultimate Edition of the game when it was on sale around January 2021, so I don't see any 'unskippable ads' that people have reported. It's a shame that they have incorporated this feature into the game if it is 1, but I won't let it degrade my perspective of the game.

[b]Graphics[/b]
Absolutely stunning. They make the UK look like somewhere you actually want to be. There's not a bad word I can say about what it looks like and it's clear why its ahead of some of it's competitors without even feeling the game. The way it looks when you drive through water, through dirt paths, when you destroy a brick wall on a drift, is just memorising. It's one of the best looking games that I have in my Steam library, along with RDR2. I run it at it's highest settings on a 2060 SUPER.

[b]Gameplay[/b]
As I mentioned at the start, I don't do car/racing games so I don't have anything to compare this to, but when I'm playing, it feels good to drive any car. Drifting corners feels smooth, especially if you hit them in the right spot. Picking a car from a huge selection and then driving it around roads just feels nice to do and that's without going into any of the events. You lose yourself in the game just by doing this, and that's what games should be doing. The world feels packed enough with content and exploration and I've barely played the game yet. I like the variety of things you can do, speed challenges, jump challenges, the barn finds, it's nice. The game has PS5 controller support too which is what I use to play, but the buttons are mapped to an Xbox controller. Some of the game's normal cutscenes are an absolute pain though, could do without in some cases. 
I've played a short while with friends who have it on the Windows Store and it's fun to play with them, but I feel I can still have the same experience even if I wasn't with them. I'm not sure whether that is a good or a bad thing really. I didn't buy the game to race against people online (I'm simply not that good enough) so we have been doing co-op races which have been a delight.

[b]Sound[/b]
The radios are a nice touch to the game, sort of how EA manage to put an amazing soundtrack to every terrible FIFA game, except this game isn't terrible. The songs add to the element of you casually cruising across the map and keep you entertained. The sounds of the world are slightly droned out by this, but obviously you can change them around in the settings. 

[b]DLC[/b]
I've not played Fortune Island yet, but I have really enjoyed the LEGO expansion so far. It's brought a different style to the game and gives it that 'arcade' feel to me as you're put in a LEGO map. The cars that I received as part of the DLC did take away that element of earning cars, but at the same time, I like having a list of them to choose from, so it's not bothered me. I'll update this section as I delve further into both expansions.

[b]Verdict[/b]
I'm currently writing this in the Steam 2021 Summer Sale, and it's worth the price. It's amazing map, events, and driving gives it full reason why it's the best driving game out there and no developer is going to take that title away from them. Yes, the in-game ads must be a shot in the chest, but I don't experience that so it's not for me to say. It's the one exclusive for me where Microsoft absolutely trump PlayStation, and I'm fine with that because I have access to it on here! I'm excited to see what Forza Horizon 5 has to offer and trust the developers completely with their next installation.",1

AWD vehicles that handle as if all 4 wheels are covered in oil forget driving anything RWD as when you accelerate it just spins its tires and fish tails until at least 3rd gear, this is not an isolated vehicle brand or model its all rear drive vehicles, NPC racers that suddenly get a second wind during a race and rocket past you and speed off into the distance their car mysteriously hanging to the road like its on a rail.

To arcade like for my tastes it feels like a modern day Crusin USA but Crusin USA was fun and so was Crusin World this however is not cars feel so odd to drive like their floating constantly and sliding about like a Hovercraft which is understandable to a degree as there is a Hovercraft in the game and i think they got a little confused and based all the cars handling on the Hovercraft aswell.",0

Interested in cool, fast, customizable cars?
You love terrible friends lists?
Got money to blow?
Do you like fun and engaging driving mechanics?
GET. THIS. GAME.
It's really good single player as well as with friends, but there is some issues.

STORY:
Why are you looking at the story section? It's a Forza game...

GRAPHICS:
The graphics are quite good in my opinion and the atmosphere is very nice. Changing seasons look amazing.
Visual damage on cars is lack luster.

ENEMY A.I.:
The A.I. is actually relatively competent. Harder AI's for team matches will actually try to crash into you, to ruin your day. Easier A.I's are still really fun to drive against.

CAMERA:
First person can be REALLY bad...
Cracked windscreen, hilly roads, fog and night time can make first person very challenging.
As for 3rd person perspectives... it's standard... it's good.

Single Player:
There is an insane amount to do single player. Dirt racing, cross country, drifting, stunts, street racing, weird business missions. This alone is worth all your money for the base game.

DLC:
Lego world is hella fun and I totally recommend that one. Building your own lego house, collecting weird, alien, lego artifacts, driving around in silly looking lego cars. Totally worth the money
Treasure island features THE BEST drifting course in the game. This alone is actually worth the money if you love drifting. It's also really nice, because you make a crap ton of ingame cash in this DLC.

Multiplayer:
Playing with your friends is fun, but the desync issues make it very awkward, when someone just teleports left and right of the road. 
Seasons bring in a ton of things to do and every type of event like drifting/racing/rally can be driven in ranked as well!
The friends list is god awful, since it's using the XBOX thing... really don't like it. Could be way more intuitive, to get to the friends list and invite your friends. But once you are in a convoy (party/group), the convoy leader can set up all kinds of races that already exist, or create custom tracks. 
Pretty good!

Bugs:
When I got the game, it was crashing every 2-3 hours, but recently I haven't had any crashes. Props to the devs! Other than that, there is no bugs, that I can tell.

Car variety:
This game has more cars than you will ever drive in-game.
Old-timers, supercars, hypercars, SUV's, hatchbacks, sports cars, formula drift cars, racing trucks, off-roaders, pick-up trucks etc. etc. etc.
This game has every single one of my favorite cars and more!
LOVE the variety!

Car Upgrades:
Tons of options for engine swaps, drive train swaps, car stance, spoilers, turbos, superchargers... etc. etc. etc. 
Like it!

Car tuning:
I personally don't really know what I am doing with tuning, so all I can say is, that it appears to be way too in depth for me. You can change everything on your car tune, so if you know something about fine-tuning, you are going to like this!

Car sounds:
This could really be better. V12's all sound the same and in general the cars sound like they are from an early 2000 title. Needs improvement!

CONCLUSION:
It's amazing. There is so much to do, so much to see, so many cars to buy and to tune for different things, the driving feels extremely nice.
Definitely recommend!",1

2985,"Split/Second, Wreckfest and now, Forza Horizon 4, join my number #1 racing games list.  

If you were to ask me out of those 3 aforementioned games which is number 1?  I would answer they all are.

You see, Split/Second has the best explosive course layout modification, with tactics and timing(as well as driving/drifting/drafting ability) being key to victory.   When you time a building explosion in a multiplayer game on the leader and you steal victory.  Those moments that make your soul tingle, that's why you love video games.  There is/was nothing else like it.

Wreckfest, on realistic damage has surviving a race as well as driving skill to win.   In multiplayer it can be pure chaotic fun.   There is/was nothing else like it.

But Forza Horizon 4 has none of those features.   The damage at most consists of scratches and dents.  A rear wing detachment at most.  The buildings can not be exploded on the opposing players.   

So why do I rate Forza?

The joy of driving.   

You can race circuits, off road trails, street races, drag races, stunts, but you can also explore. You can hunt treasures.   You can sight see.  You can just drive anywhere, anytime.   Fast or slow as you want.

The countryside is beautiful.   The cities are detailed, and the beaches with the ocean is simply enchanting.   Although you can not modify the area and track routes , you will notice the conditions change with the 4 seasons.  

The vehicles are mostly real world, but there are Lego vehicles.   You can buy, tune and paint a Toyota Supra to look like Paul Walker's for example.   The customisation is detailed and satisfying.   

Solo, Multiplayer and Co Op is executed flawlessly by Microsoft.   It is the benchmark on how multiplayer game play rewards winners and losers, team play and solo play.   A lot of smaller companies like PGI could learn a lot from this.  

So the positives ;
Forza lets you drive your car without the worry of fuel, tyre wear, gridlock or police.  You just get to enjoy driving.
Graphics on a high end PC are some of the best for a driving game.  Dynamic Rendering at 60fps with 4K.   So beautiful.
Multiplayer in all modes done right.   
Variety and customisation of cars is incredible.
Soundtrack(s) and engine effects are great.    Classical music too.   Or none, if you like the music of your motor engine.
The Special events where you race against Jets, Trains and Hovercraft.  There is nothing else like it.   
Fortune Island add on lets you be a driving treasure hunter.  
Lego Speed Champions add on lets you play with lego without the mess and the pain of steeping on that 2x4 piece.   

No real negatives but just some things that may be important.  (Nitpicking really)
Controller or steering wheel recommended
No VR support
Older game so pricing could be a little better.
But it's still worth it, however I do recommend the Ultimate pack as the add on's like lego and fortune island are really good.
Lego Speed Champions are the 6 stud scale, not the 8 stud scale like the current lego kits.  As I mentioned, an older game.  
A good internet connection is required to have fun and be competitive online.

In Summary ;

Forza Horizon 4 has good Car-ma.  (ahem)




This has been a gold standard review by Mr D One.

2993,"Fun if you like racers, campaign is terrible and voice acting is terrible but the gameplay is fun",1
2994,"I like driving games, however, I am absolutely rubbish at them. Forza Horizon 4 is the first driving game that I haven't spent my first two laps zig-zagging down the track, rage quitting, and uninstalling. A driving game that I can enjoy and even improve my skills at. My only complaints are that the radio stations can get a bit repetitive, and the occasional no reason crash to desktop.",1
2995,"Crashes once an hour, sometimes more
Edit: Appears this only happened to me because of GHub and my G920 racing wheel. Works fine on keyboard, not sure about controller but, wheel users beware",0
2996,"Amazing physics, great game!",1
2997,"Sorry for my bad english. I know its mass. but I want to write my opinion. 

First I force to myself to like this game. Graphic is wonderful, physics is work perfectly but there is a ""Problem"" which is  I cant be the part of this game.

why are we drive and whats the meaning.  I remembered the old race games. I left only when I needed to eat or s..t. 

How can games come this point.

okay there is a lots of car in this game but this is meaningless. 

We spin the wheel then I have lamborghini. 

My opinion is game is Boring  and I dont like it. 

If I have a chance I refund it right here right now.

3009,"This is literally the best racing game so far. At the beginning I wasn't really fond of this kind of games, but I decided to give it a try. Best decision ever. I have been playing this game since I bought it, and after 120 hours of playing it, I still have championships to play, things to unlock, challenges to complete, places to discover, etc... And I haven't even started with the post-game content (DLCs)
This game has a lot of content and it's not repetitive at all, you can explore the maps by your own, you can compete in rally races, road races, etc... (there are a lot of different modes and you have to level up them all if you want to unlock the different achievements and awards), you can also play car minigames like capture the flag or zombie invasion, etc...
The map is amazing and has a lot of different places to explore, and each week the season changes (I mean summer, autumn, spring and winter). This allows you to replay the content and complete the events that you have already done in a new season. Each season changes  dramatically the gameplay and the events.
And the cutscenes and animations are ABSOLUTELY astonishing. Also during the gameplay you will have to find some spots, barn signs, etc... to complete certain challenges, which forces you to explore the maps. And you will also freak out with the music, now I only listen to Forza Horizon soundtrack on my daily basis xD
You have also a story mode that you can complete. Those are short races with a specific goal, ( the story mode has a lot of chapters like this)
And finally you can also play some online events, rankeds, etc... and I spent a lot of hours pushing myself to beat the players.
The game may seem a little bit overpriced, but it's definitely worth it. As I said at the beginning of this review, is the best racing game ever.",1
3010,One of the best car games,1
3011,"[h1]5/10 - A fantastic game marred by horrific optimisation[/h1]

[i]Note: This review reflects opinions as of the FH4 Series 36 Update.[/i]
[i]This review may be edited if the development team handles concerns reflected in this review.[/i]

[h1]Pros[/h1]
[b]+Graphically Stunning[/b] (Lighting, visuals, etc. are stunning)
[b]+Repeatable Gameplay[/b] (Enough diversity in gameplay to keep player interested)
[b]+Seasons Mechanic[/b] (Creates a fun alternative every week with lakes freezing over, traction changes, etc.)
[b]+Solid Implementation of ""Gambling""[/b] (The wheelspin for rewards are provided at a reasonable quantity)
[b]+Beautiful and Diverse World[/b] (With glorious views of Edinburgh, the Lake District, etc., the views whilst driving are fantastic)

[h1]Cons[/h1]
[b]-Horrific Micro-Stutter[/b] (This game has a constant stutter throughout gameplay regardless of graphical settings)
[i](Specs are Ryzen 3900X, 32GB - 3600MHz, RTX 2070S - 1935MHz, 1TB MP600)[/i]
[i]Note: whilst not a solution, I did find that disabling g-sync reduced the stutter from full-on stuttering to a micro-stutter[/i]

[b]-Routine Crashing[/b] (Another complaint, this one being a serious one, is the periodic crashing that happens every 30-45 minutes, the game will visually freeze with audio continuing.)
[i]Note: this has caused me to continuously lose progress as I have noticed it routinely happens after race wins where the race will no longer be recognised as completed on restart.[/i]

[b]-Engine Audio[/b] (A minor complaint but worth mentioning, some higher RPM engines sound very poorly sampled almost describable as an auto-tune effect)
[b]-Race Wheel FFB[/b] (Force Feedback within this game feels very off, racing feels considerably harder with a wheel than a plain controller, so work needs to be put in here.)

[h1]Summary[/h1]
Gameplay-wise this game is fantastic. With a diverse map, more cars than you could feasibly ever drive, and enough races to keep you entertained for hundreds of hours, this game always manages to impress.
Nevertheless, where it all falls apart is the awful optimisation. My opinion on the game diminishes, knowing that I cannot get invested in the game with the lingering thought that at any moment, the game could crash.

Therefore, my final recommendation is that if you genuinely want to play this game, for the time being until further developments are made, pick up this game on the Windows Store instead of Steam, where stability is supposedly much better.",0

3019,"The racing experience is amazing!! driving over all cars exploring beautiful scenery, collecting  cars and becoming a Horizon Superstar in historic Britain feeling ecstatic!!! I adore ever sec. This is The best racing and most robust game in the series of forza horizon

3021,"A lot of cars and tuning, recommend for people who really love to tune their car",1
3022,top,1
3023,"I adore this game.

It‚Äôs a really good one. The amount of content that the game amasses is just unreal, you‚Äôll never run out of cars to try out, seasons are ever changing, and if you‚Äôre ever tired of roaming around Britain, there‚Äôs Fortune Island and the Lego City thingy.

But seriously, even in 2021, if you‚Äôve never tried any Horizon games, I highly recommend this game. The amount of content is magical - but it doesn‚Äôt come with it‚Äôs backdraws.

I‚Äôll need to get this one out, the gameplay is kinda bland. Yes it‚Äôs fun, but for almost the entirety of the game, you‚Äôre gonna be doing the same thing over and over again until you get the end, just with different cars and scenarios. The difficulty spike is also nonexistent. If you just wanna get to the end of the game, you just need to put some time in, you‚Äôll eventually finish the main career of the game. The real challenge only comes when you wanna own absolutely everything and be an absolute completionist.

And with that being said, being a completionist myself, this is a really fun game. There‚Äôs a lot to see down at Britain, and even more so in the expansions, the map is fun and honestly, put on some music and just drive around. In this tough times, it‚Äôs really nice to be in a virtual world and drive around in a sports car down winding British backroads, because then again, it‚Äôs an easy game - no need to stress over money and honestly just play at your own pace and how you like it.

It‚Äôs a nice game, almost sweet.

Until the game crashes that is.",1

My 1.2 hours ""play time"" has been spent trying to log in to my Xbox account on the sign-in screen.  I'm fed up, I posted on the Discussion Forum.  If no one can help me, I'm getting a refund.

I never rebuy games, but this is one I knew would be worth it, and the DLC is been pretty. Hundreds of hours of fun for car lovers of all skills. If you have any remote interest in cars or racing, pick this up!",1
3063,Nice,1
3064,E,1
3065,"If you like simulators but think they're too hard, but don't like arcade racers because they're too easy then get this game. It feels very much like a game that was created to allow you to have the experience that you want. 

Difficulty settings are all adjustable, from the cars physics to the AI. Cars are unlocked randomly so you'll end up with super cars and poopy cars. You drive what you want. The AI will match your car's tier. 

I haven't been entertained by just driving around on the same roads for a very long time. There's definitely a huge amount of content, the multiplayer is fun although I would like to see more party games rather than the 3 or 4 that's there. The ""battle royal"" mode is pretty fun and there's player made ""challenges"" which can also be interesting to play. The singleplayer has a few types of races from drag racing, street racing, off-road to crazy exhibition races where you [spoiler]face off against a jet[/spoiler]. Overall, it is a very fun arcade racing game. 

However... 

Microsoft really f***ed the DRM on this. It wont run if my anti-virus is active, something I've never experienced with the 700+ games in my library. Or even any games over the years for that matter. I've experienced about 5 give or take CTDs, which isn't too bad but this isn't a Bethesda game. There isn't a community that'll fix it. Online connectivity has also been a pain in the ass for us. Sometimes we'll just get network error which requires us to disconnect and reconnect to our access point. Something I've also never seen before. The game itself doesn't really 'start' until about 4-8 hours in. You can't play online until you're level 20, so don't expect to pick it up to play with friends on the same day. 

With that being said, I'd still recommend this game. It's definitely fun and I'm not even half way through so entertainment per currency unit says this is a good time waster.",1

3161,"This is an excellent game but the steam implementation is one of the worst I've seen in a long time. The game is riddled with random bugs, glitches and crashes.

So my recommendation is to buy this masterpiece of a game from Microsoft store and never touch the steam version.",0

3252,"Well, I have played Forza on the XBox before, but this is really the definitive edition. I am 61, so I have seen a lot of the older cars when they were still common on the streets, and it is especially fun to drive those whom you always admired but could never hope to drive. My first car was a 66 VW K√§fer, in brown, and it was also one of the first cars I bought and repainted in game. 

Since I've been to the UK quite often and spent some quality time in Edinburgh and in the Lake District, this was an added Bonus. Right now my favourite car is the 356A tuned to 400 points with exceptional handling and decent speed and acceleration. When I looked at the final specs they were nearly identical to my beloved SEAT Cupra I drove for a long time.

4 weeks in: While I still like the game ittself, after one week Online access was gone, and I have tried everything on the Web (Teredo, etc,) but Nada. In addition my Logitech MOMO wheel is not recognized at all, so I have to play with a Gamepad. Regarding these two MAJOR criteria for a racing game I withdraw my recommendation.",0

1. This is a 3 year old game and yet they're still charging people $60. $100 if you want the ultimate edition. To me, that's not reasonable. Luckily, I got this game on a sale for $40 which I feel is more reasonable. This game should be $39.99 max. 

2. You can tell the devs didn't do too much to port this game to steam some of the functionality when it comes to interacting with the Microsoft Store just simply doesn't work. And this game, at least for me, crashes sometimes. I've played this game on GamePass (PC) and it didn't crash this often. It's especially frustrating when the game always likes to crash while I'm in a race about to cross the finish line. 

When the game goes down in price and maybe when the crashing stops, then I'll recommend it.",0

I played the game for awhile when I had xbox gamepass. I was excited to play it again when I saw it released on steam, and just waited for a sale, because lets be honest, its a good game, but it isnt new anymore. A $60 price tag for the base game is a bit ridiculous, so I ended up buying the ultimate edition for the sale price (abt $55). Anyway, it took me a few days to download, since i needed to keep pausing since my bandwidth isnt the best. After finally finishing my download it creates a new save. I looked all over google and couldnt find an answer. It was then I learned that the steam edition is not cross save, even though I had to log into XBL. I figured it would be by default, since other Microsoft games like Halo MCC and Sea of Thieves are crossplay. So now I need to return it, buy it on the MS Store, and then redownload it since the MS Store is not very good with identifying already installed games.

[h1] TLDR: IF YOU HAVE NOT PLAYED THE GAME ON XBOX OR THROUGH THE MICROSOFT STORE AND DO NOT PLAN ON PLAYING IT THERE, YOU COULD BUY IT HERE. IF NOT, BUY IT ON THE MICROSOFT STORE, BECAUSE IT IS THE ONLY WAY YOU WILL BE ABLE TO SAVE BETWEEN PC AND XBOX [/h1]",0

3329,"[b]The game I've been searching for...[/b]

After spending the past couple of years wasting money on the newer NFS games, as well as The Crew 1 & 2, I've finally found the arcade racer experience I've been craving ever since my nostalgic days of NFS:MW and NFS:U2.  The other franchises just don't have that ""hook"", and in the case of the Ubisoft entries, are too full of predatory monetisation strategies for me to feel good about playing them.

After less than 2 days, I've sunk 7 hours into the game which may not sound like much, but my fiance had to literally tear me away from the PC last night in order for me to eat and hop into bed (damn millennial lower back pain). 

I've barely scratched the surface of what the game has to offer.  I was expecting a well-rounded single-player experience, and then they suddenly reveal that there's competitive AND co-op multiplayer?! Like, holy shit! I never really bothered with Forza games because the rest of them looked like racing sims that were just too hardcore for me, but this game... if I'd had known how good it was gonna be, I'd probably have bought an Xbox just to experience it.

Being a first-time player, I've not had the same woes of others who have come from Xbox and not been able to carry over their progress.  That really sucks because there's simply so damn much to do.  Cross-play is pretty neat, but... the price tag.  Holy crap the price tag.  I bought the Ultimate pack on sale and it was still almost $90AUD, and from what I can tell this is a game that is not a fairly recent release (at least not recent enough to warrant a brand new AAA game price).

tl;dr - fuck The Crew 2 (and Ubisoft), fuck the new Need For Speed games, and embrace Forza as the new champion of modern arcade racers.

3332,"It's a vehicle playground that trades a little bit of physics realism to emphasize the funner side of driving. I got 30 hours in before I started doing donuts in parking lots waiting for the next live event. They really should do the live events more often, because its the only real thing here that gives meaning to playing in the world with other people. Creating events and waiting for other people to join just doesn't do it for me. The live event feature is good though. The events themselves are whatever, they work. But it's quick, painless and players just have to hit one button to get in.

If you like grinding get the base game. If you like loot, get the ultimate edition. Either way its Forza racing in an open world with other real people, or solo with fake real people.",1

Is the game fun?
Absoloutely. Nothing is better than drag racing a minivan.

However if you want to play with friends then go buy the game on the windows store. The steam version constantly crashes when you try to join a convoy with your friends. Outside of joining a convoy the game has been running fine for me, it's just frustrating to have your game crash everytime you want to join your frinds.

3344,"I played this first on Game Pass and absolutely wanted to own it, but couldn't because of it's ridiculous price in the MS Store. Fortunately the Steam version has regional pricing in my region(India) and it's 1/4th the Store price.

Coming to the game, it's still the amazing Forza Horizon 4 and straight up, one of the best racers I've played. It scratches that NFS itch, while also being miles ahead of those games. 

Performance wise though, the Steam version is nowhere near the Windows one. It struggles to maintain 60 FPS in places on a 1660Ti at 1080P, something the Windows version had absolutely no issues with. It also crashes quite a lot. Sometimes in main menus, sometimes in gameplay and sometimes while exiting too. I do trust MS as publishers and expect the devs to fix it and bring it at par with the Windows version and meanwhile, I'm willing to look past the technical issues and have a blast, because the game is straight up incredible.",1

But my thought's on the game i would defiantly recommend you atleast give this game a couple minutes of you're time. i promise this game has actually has surprise me how much just the change in the season can make it feel so much more intensive for the driving experience you will go through if you play this game. but im seriously impressed how much they put in so it donest just feel like your playing a updated previous version of Horizon.,1

-The best music in any game ever

However, for people returning to the game, especially those who thought it's better to buy the game than to play it via the Game Pass, it's massively disappointing that it doesn't support cross platform saves. Your progress from other platforms WILL NOT carry over to steam and your progress here (if you have the patience to play all over and make any), will not carry over either, even though you have to link your Xbox account to this. These include events, cars, houses, credits, liveries, blueprints, etc. As of writing this review, almost a month after the official release, Microsoft has not said anything about fixing this either. As much as I love this game, it hurts for me to return this, especially considering I sold off items from another game to get this and lost 15% to steam tax

Also, since a lot of people have listed this, The Game is expensive for a 3 y/o port, although it was reasonably priced at just under $20 in India. This may vary region to region.",0

If you want to buy this game then go with the standard edition (if you don't have much budget) or else the ultimate edition (if you have the budget) is the best option, deluxe edition is not value for money.

3380,"Was a bit bummed out when I was looking forward to this game launching on steam, then was shocked at their euro VS dollar pricing of the game. Decided I wasn't gonna touch it until sale. Well, literally one month after launch on steam, I was able to pick up the ultimate edition for 45 euros off, which to me put it at the perfect price for what I wanted to pay for it.

Happy with what I have played so far, other than some lags in really strangely simple cutscenes (loading pre race) the actual in game performance is perfect even on my 7 year old gaming rig at high 1080p settings, honestly was pleasantly surprised seeing peoples concerns in regards to performance with much more recent setups. Game seems really fun too, and I can't wait to progress more through it as a first time Forza player.

Honestly really glad I got the game, I'm happy to be playing it now, and my favorite thing about getting it for this price is that I get the last laugh at the fanatics who were adamantly defending the game launching for 100 euros who are now well past their refund window and are now complaining. To all those buffoons, this is the discount price that a 3 year old (but still current) game should have launched at on steam.",1

Game loads to menu, when pressed continue it shows the loading for few seconds with the rotating circle, when the game about to show in the screen Crashed to desktop, no errors, nothing

When the internet is disconnected

The game loads to menu, pressed continue, and after few seconds the game loads as expected!
After few minutes (5 minutes max) the game again crashes to desktop.

I'm not really a car person; most of the jargon goes right over my head. That's why I find it odd that I enjoy the occasional racing game. Note that I say ""occasional"" - a game has to have a certain something, like a sense that you're part of a larger world, and not just a race track. Need For Speed (2015) is one of my favorites for that reason.

Forza Horizon 4 is built around this idea. There's no racetracks like in NASCAR or something; FH4 *is* its world, and this time, that world is in the beautiful UK. Southern Scotland positively bleeds color, and you get to experience its splendor year-round. Summer and winter are no less colorful than bright, flaming autumn, and the ongoing Horizon festival boasts special activities particular to each season. Any kind of racing you can imagine - and some you might not have imagined - can be found somewhere, at some time. And that thing I said about a larger world going on around you? Take a break from the festival and buy a house. Several beautiful homes are scattered around the map, offering you a place to chill, browse your garage, tweak your cars, and even change up your look. Oh, that's another thing - FH4 offers a selection of character avatars, so you're not just a car like in most racing games. You're a person, and the game treats you as such. You can unlock clothes as the game progresses as well.

And with the cars themselves, the variety is ridiculous. There's well over a hundred (I don't know how many, honestly) cars to collect, buy, or find abandoned in out-of-the-way barns. And countless ways to tune them. FH4 features more depth and detail than I personally have ever seen in a racing game, offering you the ability to buy and tweak suspensions and differentials and transmissions and...honestly, this stuff confuses me. But if it confuses you too, then take heart - FH4's gearhead community makes their builds available for download, so if the game's (helpful but confusing) graphics and stats and adjustments make your head spin, then you don't have to wade into it - you can get builds straight from the pros.

The community is another unbelievably huge part of the game. There's levels and rep for anything you can imagine, from different kinds of racing to photography, open world exploration, collecting cars, designing decals and paint jobs, designing events, you name it. So it's not just winning races. All kinds of people - even artists - can shine. And you can gain XP doing what you love.

FH4 is a triumph in open-world game design. There's always something new and fun going on, and always people to experience it with. Or you can go it alone. You can always go it alone if you want. And in the end, that's how you know an open-world game truly shines - if it's as fun to play by yourself as it is with friends.",1

3512,"The good:

Great racing mechanics

A variety of tracks, from mud and dirt, to regular asphalt

The driving experience on said tracks feels great. In other games it may get a bit slippery when wet, but Forza does a great job at altering the feel when doing a mud course for example

The open world is engaging and well thought out

A fun, albeit very corny story (seriously, can I be this protagonist? Walks up to a festival and in 1 hour gets two free cars, a movie role and a free house. Lucky bastard)

Good amount of cars, and diverse

The bad:

Price. I don't feel terrible for paying $60 for this, but it's a bit high

Some crashy stuff. Not anything game breaking like others have described. Some of the cut scenes are choppy and in 3.5 hours I've had one crash. It's not too bad now and it'll likely only get better

Unskippable ads. This is the most egregious thing for me. At random points throughout the game, such as after races, you will get an ad you cannot skip asking you to buy the DLCs. They usually last a minute, but it's extremely annoying. I get about one of these per hour of gameplay so far, and it least it's an ad for their own game and not some third party product but ask me how I feel about it after 20 hours and it may only get more annoying. I already paid 60 bucks for this, I don't want to see ads. I guess if you shell out $100 for the full edition you can enjoy an ad free experience

Overall a fantastic racing game with interesting and engaging mechanics, a wide array of experiences and a lot of cars to enjoy. But it shills its DLCs to you and will crash on occasion, despite the $60 price tag

3529,"Seeing an Xbox exclusive game make its arrival on Steam is a splendid thing that has happened unexpectedly. I bought the game three days after the game's release date on Steam. Below is a list of my advantages and disadvantages. Thank you to everyone for your spare time in reading my review!

Pros:
[list]
[*] Abundance of vehicles to choose from
[*] A large variety of activities to perform
[*] Active community
[*] Cross-play between Xbox and PC players
[*] Tremendous rewards (e.g. Collecting cars is similar to collecting playing cards)
[*] No microtransactions. Pay a fortune for this game, accrual of in-game items is not a grind fest.
[*] Well optimized (Runs high to ultra with my GTX 1660 Super)
[/list]

Cons:
[list]
[*] Minor sound bug in the introduction*
[*] Matchmaking is slightly buggy at the moment
[*] Cursor could occasionally disappear from Steam's overlay*
[*] Price tag for EU region is ridiculous (70 euros for Standard Edition according to EU consumers. Ultimate Edition costs approximately ¬£30/$40 in my region)
[*] No cross-saves as of now. (Hoping this comes for veteran FH4 players)
[/list]

[i] When making a decision of minor importance, I have always found it advantageous to consider all the pros and cons. In vital matters, however, such as the choice of a mate or a profession, the decision should come from the unconscious, from somewhere within ourselves. In the important decisions of personal life, we should be governed, I think, by the deep inner needs of our nature. -Sigmund Freud [/i]

3536,"Amazing game with stunning level of details but here's the things they could change to make things better.

1. The Intro is screwed - Audio bug for the intros where no audio is played
2. Transitions are laggy - Compared to the Microsoft Edition, the transitions are super choppy during load times and only on steam is this issue found which is due to poor porting
3. FPS Spikes - There is a lot of FPS spikes in the steam version compared to MS Edition
4. Price for a game this old is too much - Yes the game is awesome and still looks fresh but when Horizon 5 is around the corner, the price is kinda high, hope to see it less in the upcoming sales.
5. Random Crashes were only found on the steam edition for me atleast compared to well optimised MS Version.

Other than these things the game's perfect! - Definitely a must play and must have, hope to see these issues fixed in the upcoming batch of updates <3",1

3558,very nice n peaceful game,1
3559,"So, this review is mostly focused on the skepticism and bad reports on the Steam version of this game. Regarding the game itself, to put it short, it's as good as everyone has been saying it is. As one of the world's most casual racing fans, this is the most fun I've had in a non-kart racer since Need For Speed Underground 2. For the asking price (RM95 in Malaysia), it scratches the itch of every kind of racing game just enough, when all that ran through my head was ""I want game to go vroom"". This game definitely lets you go vroom and has been for 2+ years, and now that it's on Steam I can finally get in on that.

First off, a lot of people have been complaining about the asking price. Again, it's RM95 in my country so I personally can't complain, I paid about that much for Gears 5 which I also loved but didn't get nearly as much playtime out of as this game seems to offer. Yes, you can pay tuppence for Xbox Game Pass and get full access to this game and many others. Yes, depending on your country, the asking price to buy this game outright here can be absurd for a game that came out in 2018. Whether or not it is worth fully owning the game on Steam is entirely up to you, the game doesn't seem to be any thinner for content since its original release and I personally justified it with Game Pass not being available in my country, my personal affinity for owning games as opposed to subscribing for access, as well as my subjective value for RM95. It's a big game that I was honestly ready to pay RM200+ for on Xbox One and nearly bought the console for it. I can't tell you what your money is worth, that is entirely for you to decide.

With technical issues, the thing is there were some really silly hurdles to even get in the game. It didn't work right out of the gate, with the game refusing to launch no matter how many times I verified it. Some people reported turning off Steam Overlay worked, some said turning off Discord Overlay, some updated their drivers, turned off MSI Afterburner or RivaTuner, or even the Xbox app in Windows 10. My fix came from first turning off BitDefender, then ultimately deciding to exclude the Forza folder so I can keep my computer protected. It's 2021 and I still don't understand games not working with protection software, but here we are. The game runs flawlessly otherwise, and the Xbox Live integration works about as well as it did for Halo MCC and Gears 5 (honestly, Xbox Live has been a non-issue for me on PC since GFWL stopped being a thing, and even then it was never gamebreaking for me in the days of Gears 1, Fallout 3 and Street Fighter 4 so YMMV).

A few hours into the game and now I'm running into absolute random crashes, with no clue as to what causes them other than them mostly happening if I dawdle in menus (i.e. pausing to go to the bathroom). The game freezes for about 20 seconds then closes to no fanfare or error message. Upon light investigation, I'm not the only person with this issue (even on the Microsoft Store version), but it doesn't seem prevalent enough to be a common widespread complaint.

Regarding performance, I'm running an RTX 2060 Super with a Ryzen 7 3700x, and the 110fps I'm getting on 1080p Ultra feels warranted. There are slight microstutters which I understand are also somewhat common amongst users, but it's not frequent enough to be remotely annoying, and it mostly happens in transitions like the victory screen once you cross the finish line or when you start a new race. Honestly, it feels far more than I can possibly bargain for for how it looks (this game is probably my only reason to upgrade from a 24"" 1080p monitor hah).

So I don't know, there are people that complain for just about every game. All I'm able to tell you that with my personal regional pricing, for RM95 and 10 minutes worth of hoops to jump through, I got one of the biggest, best racing games according to many, and the first game to make me care for the genre since 2004. Especially when there are other more recent racing games that cost 3 times as much that offer maybe 10% of this game's content, I'd like to think it was pretty worth it.",1

Anyways, it's a simple game. It's an open world driving game where you drive cars really fast. If you like cars, you'll like this game.

3593,"Okay, I am now going to change my rating for the FH4 because I was finally able to get it fixed (no thanks to MS Support tho, they really are the worst!). So my problem was that I was rocking the latest Windows 10 Insider Preview Dev Build which doesn't run the game at all. So all I had to do was downgrade the windows to 20H1 and voila, the game ran! (Its easier said than done tbh as you have to take a ton of backup since your data gets erased). Now I will write a full fledged review for the game.

Forza Horizon 4: Shittier on Steam? Not by Much

Okay so the version MS has released on the Steam edition has a few caveats which I suppose you guys know by now but I am still gonna reiterate them all:

i) No save transfer from MS Store version to Steam and vice versa (A really huge deal breaker for some, but not necessarily for all)

ii) High Price for a 2 year old game (Dude wut? You play a game by its age or how much fun you have and the quality gameplay it provides? If you want discounts, just get a damn key from someplace else. Also, its not something happening for every region, only in the EU apparently)

iii) No impulse trigger support unlike the MS Store version (I really hope it arrives soon because I really loved the implementation of it in this game and it makes the game feel a lot more immersive)

iv) Some stuttering/lag/not launching issues (This is something I personally experienced and I can tell you, its not a fun thing to debug a game for over 3 days on a stretch when it should be a plug-and-play experience. I beg MS to fix all these issues on the Steam version ASAP).

v) Shit ass car sounds (Tho that's the case in both editions, but seriously tho, they are really generic sounding and even Crew 2 has better engine sounds)

But other than these 5 caveats, the Steam version is exactly the same as the MS version. Same excellent graphics, same excellent car handling physics, same excellent game modes and multiplayer (yeah the multiplayer is quite decent, stop b**ching about it). I would highly recommend you guys to pick this game up to play wherever you want. It does go on sale on the MS store sometimes but if you like to keep your library organized like me, go ahead and buy the Steam version. You will not regret that decision at all (unless like me you also face launch and crash issues :P ). So yeah, this game gets a hearty and full recommendation from me.",1

3621,Oh my god they finally fixed the stuttering. The game looks gorgeous now!,1
3622,"It keeps crashing randomly, I've tried numerous things but I guess its just my computer, or some bad interaction with another program. Regardless I won't let that say that I haven't been having fun with this game.

I think racing games, or car games in general aren't for every one, but this game is definitely one I would recommend for some one who isn't much into cars yet, but wants to be. It contains some of the most iconic, and beautifully rendered cars in history. They are nice to look at, and have a lot of attention to detail. 

If you are looking for a better racing experience coming from GTA or fivem, this is a great intermediate. It still has some arcade style to it, and is less of a 'racing sim' and more of a Racing sandbox. 

If you are running a wheel, it can be nice but isn't necessary and in many cases you will have an easier time on a controller. Also some cheaper wheels like the g29 or g920 don't play well with this game out of the box, and require some tuning to get right. 

I recommend it in general. This is a pretty wholesome, simple and sweet race car game. For kids, or bigger kids alike. If you are an artist, you can really express yourself with the cars as your canvas as the in game designer is extremely fun and can produce some stunning results with time.

If you are are really into cars, the tuning can really dial in a competition car, rally car, dragster, or make something completely wild and funny. Plenty of YouTube videos teach you how, and what does what. 

My only complaints are the instability issues I've been having (with a beyond needed in spec computer). Besides that, I cannot gripe with anything beyond what's in the game.",1

Yes, that's the whole literal quote, verbatim.

~23h later still no actual patch out.

EDIT: SEVERAL DAYS LATER, STILL NO PATCH. It's almost two weeks, still not a single patch. Tomorrow I'm refunding, my time is running out for when I can still do that.

If they actually manage to make this game at least on par with their MS Store version in the refund window of 14 days (which is like, ~6 days away, and with their glacier speed it does not seem probable) I will update the review, since the actual game is really good. Just not the Steam version of it.",0

3638,"ah looks like i played 900 hours of this and still didn't post a review. It's the 2nd most crashie game I played (after Forza Motorsport 7, and yes I was not a fool to buy Cyberdunk, so 2nd most or may be 3rd if we count infinite loading screens of Fallout). If though I played 900 hours of this I wont have recommended this to anyone before FH5 came out, now this feels like a gem. of course it too was crap on launch in xbox but they launched on steam like few months before FH5 to make some last minute cash and be able to sponsor awards for FH5... it got some award in ""Sound"",  it seems the Judge never drove a car in life. Anyway back to FH4, it's good, decent after infinite number bug patches, it's not great with a wheel, i somehow managed. The content is good, the Dirt tracks in DLCs are really really well designed, if you like dirt rally, it's actually a good game. The Porsche especially are awesome in dirt like in IRL. And you get the IRL rally liveries made by the community. The tracks in FH5 are 3rd grade, FH4 I recommend.",1

3668,"I love this game, but...I can't give it a positive review.

The core gameplay loop is the best I've ever seen in a racing game- you're *constantly* rewarded for just existing basically in the game's open world. It's so fun and so satisfying to rack up combos while driving around- really gives me that Pro Skater vibe to it all. 

The adjustable difficulty is really good too, especially the wording- at the end of the day, it's all just a bonus! that's really good and rewarding! more devs should take this approach to game difficulty.

However- a big draw to this game was the online experience- whether it's just driving around with friends, or doing events and seasons together!

This is where the game falls short for me.

From just trying *five separate times* to do an Autumn season event, or just getting randomly disconnected while in the open world- the online is just kinda awful. 
Not to mention some of the seasonal challenges either not working properly or *having someone just clip through a wall during a Playground Games event, which caused my entire team to just quit out.* Screw you.

Again, this is one of my most favourite racing games of all time- but it's because I love the core game so much that I have issues with the rest of it, and that drags the experience down.

Not to mention the framedrops and CTDs, lmfao.

Wait for a sale.",0

3676,"Game crashes due to ram usage. I have 16gb and no issues with any games i play. After some searching i learned that this game apparently doesn't cash out your ram data so once it builds up the game just crashes. They said this was an nvidia driver issue but it is not, because i've already tried that.

 So, obviously, no fix coming...

It's a fun game besides being very difficult to play without 3rd party programs to clear your ram for you. I usually also have to full restart my computer just to get the game started, along with clearing my ram. All this and my computer is above the recommended specs. Very disappointing because I waited years to finally be able to play this on a decent setup and it really is hard to enjoy with these huge issues.

Edit: Now 2 weeks have passed and apparently the developers are aware of the games current state and that the game is basically unplayable for many Nvidia users. Their ""solution"" to fix this problem is to tell people to downgrade the driver to an older version.

THIS IS NOT A SOLUTION !!!

There are people that own a RTX 40xx card who have paid a lot of money and don't even have the option to downgrade the driver since it is incompatible with the latest generation of RTX.

3688,"TL;DR it's a mostly enjoyable sandbox (in the most literal sense of the word) open-world racing game that gives you a lot of cars to play around with, but not many things to do with them. There's not much goal nor greater purpose other than to get cars, customize, and drive them. Possibly a nice entry game if you don't know much about cars.

This is my first Forza game and my first impression wasn't great, the things that keeps pop up in my head as I play are [i]""is that it?""[/i] and [i]""what am I supposed to do now?""[/i]. The game feels very directionless. The main reason for this is, rewards for the players are very generous (this is neither a good nor a bad thing inherently).

Sense of progression is non-existent because you can have cars for the fastest racing class in the first few minutes; players barely got any extrinsic motivation from the game because the usual motivator, the rewards, have less significance. Pride and accomplishment for getting a car you want is diminished when you didn't even put any effort into getting it. It took some time for me to warm up to the idea of treating cars as if they are cheap [strike]hoes[/strike] toys that you swap around all the time with no lasting commitment or bonding time with.

The generous reward is a double-edged sword, and the other side of the blade is just the plain old more variety for you to try, this is where the sandbox aspect comes in. To truly enjoy this game one must bring their own intrinsic motivation to drive the car [b]you[/b] want and do whatever [b]you[/b] want to/with those cars. The game hands you so much freebies, your choice are only limited by your own desire (or some BS artificial scarcity the game has for Toyota cars). It's very much a [i]""you make your own fun""[/i] game.

There are various events and modes that you can do in the game if you want to do them for some reason, they exist pretty much solely for you to test out different cars. There's also these NPC quests that are basically the highlight of this game for me, because they have goals, balanced difficulty, and a neat little story to boot (80% are cringe inducing, but compared to the hollow emptiness of the rest of the game, it is an oasis in a tenere).

Personally I much prefer straightforward games with decent progression, goals, actual challenge, activities and rewards that doesn't feel pointless, and the likes; but games like this have it's place and I'm sure it appeals to many people (it could be you!) 
It is most likely made to be more accessible for people who aren't as into cars, thus not knowing what they want from the start and can experience first hand numerous vehicles to find the one they clicked with.",1

its better than 5 for lots of reasons:

(played ~30 hours of 5 on xbox through gamepass, ~40 hours of 4 through gamepass before buying through steam, i like owning my games!!)

- at least for me, britain is FAR more interesting to drive around than mexico purely because I like the aesthetic more, makes me feel like im clarkson, hammond, or may in top gear.
- seasons! so well done and provide so much more variety than I felt was offered in FH5
- in general, having more content, being an older game with more time for fixes, easier to run, etc.

3704,I usually don't play racing games but this is hands down of the best racing game I've played in past 2 decades and first open-world racing game that was easy to understand. It is visually beautiful and wonderfully functional at the same time. I'm enjoying it even with just 25 hrs in. I'd advise you to lower the difficultly level just one notch below average if you are new to racing games for starters and are finding winning difficult. The map is very easy to use in this game as compared to games I've encountered before this. The race route gets marked on screen-HUD thus making it easier to navigate. The terrain is beautiful and controls can be customised. The cars can be tuned and many people have made presets which can be purchased for credits. All in all if you are new to the racing genre and have a decent PC-Laptop you should buy this game's ultimate version for the best racing experience one can have.,1

3717,"As someone who doesn't play racing games a lot, I have to admit this game is very impressive. Gameplay, sound, open world, the huge amount of cars you can choose from, everything just feels right.
If you can, get the ultimate edition while it's still on sale and you have around 50 hours of playtime save (and you probably won't leave the house for a few days).",1
3718,"The Good:
- Game graphics are quite good.
- Handling physics are decent.
- Upgrades and tuning are plenty.
- Cars are also plenty.
- Money and cars are not too difficult to get. 

The Bad:
- Overall content is quite underwhelming as I finished the game sooner than i expected.
- Upgrades and tuning is where you spend most of your time on.
- Crashes and bugs are not too uncommon.
- AI (drivertars) are pretty bad and glitchy especially playing with friends in a convoy.
- Drift content is almost non existent.
- No option to turn down in game music to 0 and the workaround for this is to turn on Streamer Mode which does not even save after you close the game, pretty dumb if you ask me.

Conclusion:
Even though i mention more bad than good, get the game on sale or a heavy discount. Would recommend to those who likes a blend of casual to competitive racing. Fun game to play with friends especially.",1

3721,"Pros
- Awesome graphics.
- Lots of freedom to go where you want, many terrain pieces are destructable so you can drive through them.
- Lots of things to do e.g. collect cars, complete various race types, complete stunts, pvp, co-op, tune cars, paint cars, seasonal quests with great rewards, get achievements, level one of the many disciplines etc.
- Great ""Rewind"" system where you can rewind a piece of the race to correct a mistake.

Cons
- Atrocious interface with way too many dialogs, way too few info on the screen, way too much whitespace, way too large fonts, no context menus, no tooltips, way too many pictures, way too few shortcuts etc.
- No chat in multiplayer so coordinating something is not possible. Very strange as many things in the game are ""multiplayer"".
- Keeps asking to link XBox and Steam accounts even if you don't want to. It is playable without linking them tho.
- Intro not skippable, mandatory 20 sec wait each time when starting the game.",1

3731,"I‚Äôm not sure how many people will be reading this now that 5 is out, but I‚Äôll give it a shot anyways. Forza Horizon 4 is the only racing game I want to play. Sure there are some other good racing games out there, but this one takes the cake for me. Once you get past the boring opening tutorials, the game really opens up. The pace is so relaxed, so you never feel like you have to keep up with missions and all of that. I can just leisurely drive around the huge world, smashing into stuff and taking awesome screenshots. And if you have crazy OCD like me, you can turn off car damage so your sports car always looks new. There‚Äôs a nice diversity to the locations and the seasons are definitely welcome. You can race in the pouring rain in spring, and slide around on ice in winter. I do wish you could change them manually, but it does feel more realistic the way it‚Äôs set up. Unfortunately I wasn‚Äôt a huge fan of the radio stations. Being into modern rap, I found it hard listening to the Blockparty station that favored old-school hip-hop over the 3 good songs. If you‚Äôre into EDM there‚Äôs plenty, but any other genre and I suggest playing your own music. It really adds to the experience when you pull of sweet tricks when you have your fire mixtape going in the background. These moments make me want to make cool videos, but unfortunately it‚Äôs tricky. The only replay mode is for official races, which feels limiting. If you have a friend operating the drone cam it‚Äôs great, otherwise you‚Äôll be stuck. The actual races are good fun, with multiple difficulty modes depending on what you want that day. I liked being able to turn it down when I just wanted to chill. I‚Äôm not sure how many people will actually do all these races, but there‚Äôs definitely a lot to choose from. All the choices can actually get annoying sometimes. While screwing around, I was often spammed with voice lines trying to get me to race or find an abandoned car. I DONT WANT TO, LEAVE ME ALONE! As for the cars, they feel great. There‚Äôs plenty of different ones to pick, from sports cars to station wagons. I suggest buying the ultimate pack if possible as it gives you lots of options out of the box. Otherwise it can take a bit to unlock the cooler ones. Overall this is the chillest racing sim around, with a huge world and forgiving physics. If you can put up with a few nagging issues, you‚Äôll love it.",1
3732,"Without xbox client this is best open world best car game, Microsoft Xbox is really shit, I told that because when you try to connect with friends to paly it online its not easy. even after connect to convey there are so many bugs. But this game is good for play ''solo play'' because It has music that make you feel comfortable while playing. This is really good game to play for solo player. But remember x box client and overlay is really shit",1
3733,all can i say is that im not regreting for buying this game,1

3736,"When I purchased Forza and started playing it for 7ish hours or so, I was expecting it to be an arcade racer. Major publisher and super sized production budget. But when the basis of your game relies on racing. One would expect that the car driving experience would be top notch with believable car handling mechanics. Yet each race plays out exactly the same when racing with the computer. It's like cars are racing on rails. The same standing outcomes happen every single time you restart a race. The game is so easy at times that you either finish first with the difficulty setting that you're in or it is too hard in the setting a notch up and you'll always finish last. You try and follow the computer cars ahead of you taking bends and corners in the road at the same speed that they are going and they don't slide, fishtail or drift - as if they are glued on track rails. Frustrating racing experience. So I find myself switching between average and above average to balance certain race events.

If you can look past the aggressive AI drivers and annoying influencers crap being forced on you at every second. You will find an enjoyable game. Just take it as it is and expect to do things with cars that are totally unrealistic in real life. Think Fast and the Furious, but go up a few notches, lol.

Has 700+ cars - street cars, trucks, supercars, hypercars, classics, rallycars etc. Lots of race types ranging from street races to rally, to dirt races, to drifting. On to of that there are 4 weather seasons that change every week, and with that are constantly changing seasonal races and challenges.
And DLC brings even more content, altough DLC may be a bit pricey.
Is based on Forza racing sim games, physics are quite good, you actually need to slow down on corners. Car customisation is limited but enought, Car tuning is also cool.
Since its an open world game, you actually can crash out of most crash barriers and into bushes, as opposed in most other games where barriers create invisible wall that protects your car.

3778,"Graphics: Visually fantastic. Very few bugs, and in a lot of ways, we're nearing photo-realism here. This is a fantastic game to screenshot, and is visually impressive in all sorts of in-game weather and lighting conditions. Not much else to say here.

Audio: Car sounds are very impressive, but could be a little better. The engine and tire noises themselves are great, but a little more detail and variety would be appreciated. In other words, some cars share the same V10 noise, for example, when they don't in reality, but in situations like these, the inconsistency is believable enough to not really be a bother. I know FH5 does a better job of this, though. The soundtrack is worth a mention as well, as there's a large variety of music split into ratio stations, with good radio DJs. but they can get old after a while.

Gameplay: Driving physics are solid for a sim-cade. I find that the game feels best with a controller, and using one to drive really fast cars is much more forgiving than in the Forza Motorsport games and most other sim-cades. FH4 is still compatible with a wheel, and it's definitely usable, but since I'm used to using a wheel with iRacing and other simulators, it doesn't feel quite right to me, and doesn't add enough to the experience for the extra hassle to be worth it. That's largely personal preference though.
As far as content is concerned, the variety in cars and car customization is fantastic, and I don't think you'd find the same anywhere else. The map is very large and filled with collectibles and contains many great features and areas. I do wish there were more on-road events and races, considering that's what the majority of the cars in the game are geared towards, and I didn't enjoy the extra ""story"" events and 10-mission-sets enough to warrant so many, but that's again personal preference.
Multiplayer is fantastic, and very seamless. It's great with friends especially, and I've more of a positive experience with the versus multiplayer than I originally expected. The battle royale mode they implemented is surprisingly good as well.

TL;DR: Crazy amounts of content, and overall a really great gameplay experience. Extremely approachable by casual car enthusiasts, and very enjoyable for someone with more a racing sim background as well. While the Ultimate Edition (which I recommend) pricing is pretty steep, when the game is on sale it's absolutely worth it for anyone that's at all interested in cars and racing.",1

3793,"Quite frankly one of the best games I have ever played. I started playing the series with Horizon 3 on Xbox One X back in 2018 and ended up going through this on both Xbox One X and now PC. This game is absolutely incredible and there is so much you can do in this game it's absolutely insane! The racing is mesmerising to say the least, the controls feel absolutely perfect with many options to tune your controls to your liking. The graphics are absolutely astonishing, one of the best looking games I have ever seen in my life with a huge amount of attention to detail in the world and vehicles. There is so much content in this game you'll literally never get bored with it. It has one of the most impressive soundtracks to a game in recent years, full of rock, pop, EDM, classical and hip hop songs to your liking (Greta Van Fleet's Safari Song is awesome!) Plus you get some meaty expansions with Fortune Island and Lego Speed Champions that will continue on the fun of this series.

This game honestly continues to amaze me even with the Steam release. I only have a couple of gripes with this version though, specifically game options not working at all like turning ANNA (The GPS) off doesn't do anything and is broken, and the fact that the reveal of your barn finds are null grey cars. But in all honesty, most of my gripes are nit picks and don't effect the high level of quality of this game. 

PLEASE NOTE that you should buy this game now while you still can. Every year another Forza game gets delisted meaning the digital versions essentially become lost media and this unhealthy practice of delisting these beautiful and amazing games means a huge loss for game preservation as a whole and I seriously wish the developers and Xbox Game Studios would stop this practice and just continue to renew the licenses every year. Not renewing the licenses is ridiculous and everyone should get a chance to experience this game.

Either way, this is one of the best games of the 2010's. An instant classic. Even people who don't play racing games will love this.",1

3827,Nice,1
3828,This awesome game is Amazing.,1
3829,"Ok in all fairness I have to change my review as a number of changes have been made over the last few months I've had the game.

TLDR: Unskippable ads seem to have stopped a month or so after my initial review. Game crashes are far less frequent but still there. Cheating - well that is still there in great numbers. Would I recommend the game? Maybe. I wouldn't convince anyone to buy it but I wouldn't put anyone off from trying it either. 

Longer Review:
It really is a gorgeous looking game. The races have enough variation to keep you interested, and the malleability of the landscape is impressive. You can literally drive everywhere on the map, with small and medium obstacles crumbling as you crash through them, and only larger buildings/trees stopping you in your tracks. 

The game isn't suddenly perfect, the below summarises the negative side of things which has greatly improved vs my initial experience:

[b] Adverts [/b] - Still not thrilled they push the expansion packs but I can at least skip them now if they crop up. In the past they were forced and you couldn't skip them.

[b] Cheaters [/b] - Every single leader-board is filled with literal thousands of users with impossible stats: TG speed run in 5 milliseconds; Drift challenge records 10 million points exactly in a few minutes; Jump distances cover nearly half the map; Yeah no. It is insane to think that these ""achievements"" get onto the leader-boards without an easy insta-ban. And for a racing game this is extremely easy to fix with simple measures and limits - but the devs don't seem to care. Gone are the days when you could see how you stack up against others globally - now it's just a fight between cheaters as to how outlandish they can get. 

[b] Rigid Presets [/b] - There are an extreme number of settings and customisations - so it was nice of them to allow you to download popular ones for cars based on the community, but forcing you to go to the Festival site/Home to apply a tune/buy a car is a bit annoying and breaks the continuity of a racing series if you realised you need a different car for an event that you have to still purchase and modify. Teleporting a car to you however is fine?

[b] Handling [/b] - Look it needs more refinement for sure. Is it better than modern NFS titles? Absolutely. Is it hard being better than modern NFS titles? Not if you have more brains than a banana.

Overall I'm extremely hopeful if the next installment tones down the DLC adverts or at least allows users to skip it until they are interested; if it clamps down harder on cheaters; and it allows better flexibility for customisations without having to return to the Festival site/Home. 

My dream is that this really takes the fight to the NFS franchise because we all know it's stagnated badly over the last few iterations.",1

3831,A great driving game with the tons of cars and customizations.,1
3832,"Free roam and multiplayer is very good.
There are shit ton of cars and more shit ton of events/stories/collectibles/stunts etc.
Designs for cars are great (I mean vinlys and such).
Customization is meh but there is tuning which I never touched but there seems to be a lot of options. You can use other people's tunes/designs/challenges/races so you aren't losing much by not touching creative parts of the game.
Cars feel good to drive and doesn't feel very arcade(arcadish?arcady?) and there are options to simulate a realish experience but again I never touched it.

A great experience overall.",1
3833,what a great game,1
3834,I accidentally started driving on the left side of the road in real life when I shouldn't be. I'd rather crash in-game than in real life so I'll continue driving on the right side of the road in Forza Horizon 4.,1

3839,"It's a great game with so many cars and lots of fun with friends however the multiplayer matchmaking is a disaster, and there is no real progression system it's more like a sandbox so you don't get the satisfaction of unlocking new cars and content the game just throws cars at you.",1

3851,"1. Graphics - they are so beautiful your eyes will feel relaxed and comforted looking at the screen,
You won't have ever seen such graphics in any game, they are just outstanding plus dynamic rendering is offered in graphics settings so no matter how bad your graphics card is, the game will give a playable fps.

2. Music-  Soundtrack is great, and there is a lot of variety because it has multiple radio stations with different genres of music to suit your taste.

3. Cars- a lot and lot of cars to play from, from off-road to super cars like the buggati this game offers them all

4. Driving mechanics:- great physics and handling offered, it's realistic but fun at the same time . 

5. The world:- there is a lot of terrain variety from muddy roads to highways to mountain driving to coastal driving, to stunt jumps.

6. Season:- seasons are the cherry on the topping of this cake, they are so well animated and alive that even people who don't care about them will really start loving changing seasons. The style of play and the terrain and ground slipperyness also changes with seasons just like in the real world and rain and snow graphics along with the autumn yellow orange leaves all are gorgeous.",1
3852,"I think you could pretty much take my ""The Crew 2"" review, word-for-word, cross out all ""Crew"" references with a marker and write ""Forza"" and nobody would notice the difference.  But that's good.

So it's a car porn game.  We're not talking super-detailed handling models or anything, just a game with an open world and a lot of cars.  If you're the sort of person who knows the difference between a Z4 and a Z4 GT3, or goes, ""Cool!"" if there's a Lotus, well, then this is for you.

Also coop, which is nice.

This game's plot didn't make me cringe in the same way that The Crew 2 did, but it's not exactly going to be winning any prizes for writing.  Look, there's people doing races, and you race the races, and you get money and put more vroom in your cars.  If you want more plot, I donno, maybe an evil car killed your orphan parents and the only way to avenge their deaths is by, uhh, racing cars really hard?

Anyway, seriously, it's a fine enough example of the genre.  I'm satisfied.  I'll get some mileage out of it with my wife and we'll drive goofily-painted cars around for awhile until the next distraction comes along.",1
3853,"Forza Horizon 4 is nothing short of fantastic. With a host of content, backed by a fantastic roster of cars that tread the fine line between arcade and simulation perfectly. While the amalgamated UK may be a little too pristine, not completely reflecting reality, it's such a stunning and enjoyable place to race around that any issues are washed away in the utter fun you're having. Forza Horizon 4 is, without a shadow of a doubt, the pinnacle of the series and arguably the best racing game you can buy.",1
3854,"So far I've found it to be an open world racing game.  If you're into that kind of thing then this is for you!  If you're looking for a more traditional racing game then this title might be best served on the back burner.

FH4 runs at 100+ fps on ultra, the stuttering is not FPS lag, but something I can not control by upgrading my PC.

If you are a turbo boomer or your drooling 9 year old self ended up playing Korean/Japanese(?) racing MMOs like Drift City and/or Need for Speed World like I have, you will find that the Horizon games incorporate their charm except without the ""freemium"" microtransaction-laden experience.

 They tell you its your fault, something on your end, even though you went through every fix from their support pages.

Worst of all, they tell you its fixed... yet still no one can connect.

In conclusion:

They should fix their existing games before pumping out new ones... being a typical greedy company making half completed games. This game is basically updated abandonware at this point.

3923,"On one hand fh4 is a greatly immersive racing game with an enormous amount of cars and tracks to choose from and you might enjoy it a lot if your purpose is to play it offline. 
On the other hand, its a broken game that is left to get rotten in steam. I had the purpose of playing this game online with friends when I bought it however the game is so broken it is almost unplayable. These are not the problems only I have, I have checked everywhere on internet and the situation seems to be the same for hte most people. When you try to start online races, or ""quick adventures"" the forever taking loading times greet you, at that point you have to accept waiting 20 minutes for a 3 minute race and then waiting another 20 minutes to fast travel you to the next races location which is taking out all the tension and ambition out of the game. Even if you are calm enough, not all the other players are and you end up with half of the lobby leaving the game even before the race begins, and the half of the rest will leave when they make one small mistake during the game. At least there is another game mode, which things like leaving are not tolerated right? NO, players can leave ranked games without any consequences, at least no one minds the consequences. Teammates leaving ranked matches is not the worst thing tho, the thing is even if you win the tournament all by yourself (which you will probably do if you are good enough) the match does not give any points because somebody left the match, which makes the whole ranked system broken since almost every match takes forever to load and half of the games start after some people giving up waiting. On top of all this, my rank is somehow the victim of a common bug, which is inside the ""known issues"" of playground games long list, and it does not update, it does not matter if i win, lose or even leave the game intentionally, it does not affect so I am stuck at one rank forever. If ranked matches do not affect my rank than what is the point of playing ranked? 

There is even more, all of these multiplayer problems well known by the publisher are hidden by making new players play a 2 hour introduction (takes more or less 2 hours) that makes them lose their right of returning the game. Smart move, making customers sure that they will not be buying anymore games from them. Even though it is fun playing this game when it rarely works properly, it is not worth paying that much money into an almost 3 years old game which still has more bugs than cyberpunk and makes it unplayable is a pure waste of money and joy.

3944,"Im a big fan of arcade racing game. Used to play all the Need For Speed games, Burnout series, Midnight Club, MotorStorm, Split/Seconds, Blur, The Crew, you named it, I played them all. But I have never own an Xbox before so I never try Forza Horizon even though I always heard big praise.

Until today, I finally try it and Im blown away!!!. I have to say without a doubt that Forza Horizon 4 is the best arcade racing game. All the games I mentioned above is not even close to FH4. From the graphic, performance, car handling, variety of stuff to do in the game, car lineup, everything is perfect!! I dont think I can even come back to play other arcade racing game after trying this.

Whenever Forza Horizon 5 comes, if its not on PC, then I will probably get an Xbox for the first time. Its that good!!!",1

3949,"This game has the shittiest matchmaking and ranked match style I have ever seen. First of all nearly all of the dirt races are actually asphalt and it is fucked up.  You are entering with your team of 6 and you are locking first and second row but opponent leaves the game and because opponent is 1 person even if it is 3rd it wins the game. What kind of idiotic point system it is ? just fix the point for every possible places like 1 st 1000, 2nd 900, 3rd 800. And even there are only 3 players give them these point. So when some rager idiotic kid who can't drive leaves the fcking game it won't steal our victory. Another point I am reaching league 7 but when I enter next race it show league 10. I am again entering league 8 but it show 9 what the holy fuck is that. This game really test my nerves. Even if I became first with my talent it still give me shit",0
3950,"That's absolutely the most classic and iconic racing game across all the platforms since it was released, however the optimisation of this steam version of Forza Horizon 4 is terrible. Low FPS, shattering and crash that you probably encounter while playing this game will not appear in another version that is downloaded from the Microsoft Store. Although several patches have been released trying to fix a range of issues, the game still contains significant problems that affect your gaming experience. It looks like a newly developed game rather than the one that has been released for almost 4 years. Hope the developers could continuously patch the issues and bug and create a better experience for us soon. By the way, if you already own the game at other platforms or stores, it's not recommended to purchase this at steam as cross-save is disabled that means you could not transfer your progression to this version.
[08/Apr/21 edit] After the latest patch, the game seems more likely to crash, although stuttering is sort of reduced.  
[11/Apr/21 edit] The game will quit automatically by itself after 2-3 hrs playing. So I will not recommend you to buy this until these issues are fixed. 
[17/Apr/21 edit] The latest update has significantly increased the experience. Stuttering is significantly reduced and fps is more stable.",1

3965,"Yeah, got several things to say about the game.

Gameplay 9/10 :
Free for all, whatever you do you increase your level. Even if you just loitering around the map enjoying your ride (or messing around). Gacha system is good because you get the chance by accomplish something, not because you pay for it. Race is pretty well balanced and got many difficulty level. Tuning is great, i love tuning and testing my car (and accidently gain a few level without progressing much). Many many cars and each one of them is unique. Collision is pretty bad tho, there is almost no collision/ragdoll effect in this game. You can't jump over indestructible walls because there is an invisible indestructible wall on top of it.

Customization (8/10) :
Great, my only complaint is just i can't directly get an image from outside source to become my vinyl. I need to trace it with applying decals one by one. very time consuming and tears consuming.

Control 7/10 :
I don't know but this steam version is worse than xbox version, sometimes it won't response when i press some button.

Environment (10/10) :
Great view, England's outskirt is beautiful.

Sounds (6/10) :
Nothing interesting, the radio channel were boring, still got some classic music is a plus lol.

Bug (Funny/10) :
I love this game's bug. Kinda annoying but funny.

Overall, I enjoyed this game a lot. Able to play with my friends is great experience.",1

3973,"This is my first entry to the Forza franchise and.... wow. If you love cars, do yourself a favor and get this game.",1
3974,"I like it a lot, but honestly it has crashed like 8 times already, I didnt even have Cyberpunk crash that many times.. Worst part about the crashes, 1 happened right after a wheel spin were I won 2 Gold items, a very cool car and a bunch of credits, and a 2nd one right after I did a SWEEET combo, with a BIG multiplier. I was gettin really excited to see a big number, especially with all my time in Leaf Blower Revolution lately, but alas, another crash right as I stuck the f#@king landing.

I am sure a patch is imminent, but for real, very bummed about the losses, and potential future losses. Especially for a 3 year old game that is STILL full price,  =(

Edit: since then, about 10 more hours and 3 more crashes. Its so nice to drive a nicer car than mine though still. The dilemma.",0
3975,Great game for anyone looking to have some fun blasting around an open world replica of UK. It's the perfect blend of arcade like gaming and realism.,1
3976,"Easily the best racing game of the last decade. Open world and races are great. Now that its on steam, it works better too. Nothing bad about it.",1
3977,"It's a really well polished arcade/simulator racing game, leaning more towards the arcade feeling especially because many races are driven on a public roads with other non-racing cars on it. The game is set in an open world where you drive to a start of an event etc, like eg. Crew 2 or Burnout Paradise.

There's really not much to say about it that wouldn't already been said dozens of times on this page, or in any other review - or even in the marketing trailers. I just wanted to add my thumbs up to counter the angry non-deserved downvotes here.

---

Note about current overall score: Most of the ""do not recommend"" reviews on this page are just giving thumbs down because of the high price for a 3 year old game, or because you can't transfer your progress from Windows Store platform to Steam.

Personally I wouldn't go straight to downvoting a game because of either of those, but whatever. Pricing can and should be commented on, but I'd rather leave it out of the review ""score"" - if it's a good game, it's a good game. Everyone has their own limit on how much they're ready to pay for a good game.

For now, it seems like the game is easily worth the 70‚Ç¨+ price tag for me - I don't really care if it's a 3 year old game if it's still great.",1

So whoever is reading this topic I have finally solved the issue for my end and it came by contacting xbox support and telling them it was happening in multiple games. A little background that may be helpful for anyone doing research.
My NAT type was open and server connected in xbox networking (had to hit fix and check again sometimes)
In device manager/add legacy hardware there was no microsoft teredo device but I did add one labeled ""TAP Adapter V9 for Private Tunnel""
IP Helper and Xbox Live Networking Service in services are automatic and running
Window Defender Firewall is on
So here is what finally did it for me:
First I had to go into my router and disable UPnP and enable DMZ
Then Window + R and search msconfig
Deselect the Load startup items
Go to service tab and check ""Hide all Microsoft Services""
Select the disable all option and hit ok
Restart PC
I do not know if this will work for you but it works for me and I will edit this if I run into any more problems. If it does not work I would recommend contacting xbox support but do not say it only happens in Forza Horizon 4 because then they will send you to Forza to support a ticket and get nothing solved. Plus xbox support has 24/7 chat which is easiest. Hope this helps anyone going through the awful problem I was.",1
3984,"It's just good, clean, fun arcade racing. Loving it so far (Ultimate Edition). I don't play racing games very often - Burnout Paradise is the last/only one I've ever mastered back in the day. I do like having one in my library though for when the mood strikes and I'm glad I went with this one. The Lego DLC is great, haven't tried the other DLC yet. Runs like a dream so far. No complaints.",1
3985,worked fine for 2 or 3 hours and now it just crashes whenever i try to enter the game after the start menu.,0
3986,"Most of the poor reviews are due to save carry issues and the fact that it's 2 years old and still a full price game.

If you like cars and driving games, FH4 is hands down the best game for it. While there are some more realistic games or other games more catered to certain types of racing (F1, Rally, etc.), FH4 is all around the best driving game out there. Excited to finally see it on STEAM!",1

3989,HAHA car go vroom vroom zoom woosh brrrrrr,1
3990,"For now a big negative. Aside from being insanely overpriced with many DLCs NOT included in the Ultimate Edition.

Many modes and coop options, sadly AI is overpowered in higher difficulty as always. 
Lego A-Class 900 AI vehicles just out speed my X-Class 999 car on acceleration, can't catch up the whole race yet beating best times - still getting 2nd or 3rd.... AI vehicles are made out of rocks, they don't move a bit, but ram you car away like it's paper.


This game is couple years old, yet lacks proper optimization for pc. 
Stutters, fps drops and unnecessary high ressource taxing. Turning settings down or up doesn't change a thing. My pc can handle this game on maxed everything 144 fps on WQHD. Yet i locked my game on 72 fps and this trash still stutters here and there - even on lowered settings.
Alongside with many crashes (for me while being a while in the auctionhouse browsing around, crash every 5 minutes)


Prices are a mess, when good cars are cheap AF and oldtimers are one of the most expensive vehicles. You need atleast 20-40million to get one good car for every season & every type of car. Grinding money is forced unless you're fine with placing top 5 at max.

You need to write down a whole list of which car to use in which season/weather. 
It's insane to me how much you have to either remember or note somewhere. 
I always have a whole spreadsheet pulled up from long time players, to follow which car to use in what kind of race / what kind of season.


Tuning offers good amount of tweaks, although requires hours to put into. 

Definitely not worth the hassle, looking for preset tunes from other users is the way to go. Sadly not much are around and some good ones from years ago are deleted.


Manual saving is not possible. You have to force saving with entering or exiting your houses or finishing races. Lots of things are forced online. 

Game is cluttered with unnecessary collectibles (boards).

Fast travel costs money and requires lots of collecting to get lowered. 
But it will never be free, not even as ""VIP""....haven't seen much of my VIP benefits yet.


Decent game, ruined by greed for money, forced online content, paywalling cars/DLCs, ressource taxing anticheats that aren't even necessary for a game like this...i'm good. Might grab the FH5 for some cheap $$ on a keysite. But this game pretty much asks me to get uninstalled.",0

I suggest anyone considering purchasing this look at the sticky where it list all the programs that should be disabled or uninstalled to avoid the issue I had.  This is a partial list......

Logitech G Hub
MSI Afterburner / Riva Tuner Statistics Server
EVGA Precision
OBS
Xsplit
Discord
MacType
Warsaw Banking App
Wallpaper Engine
A-Volute Sound studio
Nahimic Audio
Sonic Audio

I'm running Afterburner, Discord, Logitech G Hub......no clue which if any of those was causing the issue but if a game conflicts with common software running on many gaming computers then I think a refund is in order.",0

Not rec for 5700XT users. Caused my PC to hard crash many times even with clean windows install during plane intro scene :'^)

(Same with FH4 which caused my PC to shut of 6 times before refunded)
Note: Also tried a multitude of additional solutions and components are well above spec
https://forums.forzamotorsport.net/t/horizon-5-shutting-my-pc-down-totally-shuts-off-help/535668/63

UPDATE: Was able to get passed the plane drop intro without crashing by doing the following (Unsure what exactly fixed the problem):
Install on my boot drive (C)
Set both monitors to 1080p (One was 1080p, the other 1440p)
Play it on the 60Hrz 1080 monitor
Set everything to Low
Lock the framerate to 60
Uninstall Logitech G software
Uninstall Logitech Capture
Disabled Radeon screen recording
Shut down voicemeeter
Set default input/output devices to my headset

After completing that and doing another mission or 2 to open the world up ive been able to:
Put my monitors back to their default settings
Enable voicemeeter
Run the game at higher settings though still locked to 60
Moved it to my other drive
Reinstall Logitech capture and G hub
When in Discord I have to run it on medium settings or else risk crashes.
It now runs fine however at times can still crash and so far has done a hard crash twice.

I bought this even though I have it on Xbox/Windows Store so I could play it on PC while still leaving the console available for use for family sharing, and play it with the people I live with.

Normally I can play all of my games on windows, even Game Pass PC ones, without it affecting the people using my family sharing on the console.

Not Forza though, for some reason while playing this Steam purchased version of the game I get signed out on my Xbox, stopping family sharing from working. And then inevitably signing back in kicks me from the game on PC.

That doesn't even happen when I play actual Game Pass games on my PC while using family sharing on the console.

Otherwise I love this game, but the entire reason for my purchase was to NOT use the game pass version and be able to play it together, so until this seemingly Forza only restriction is gone I cannot recommend buying the steam version.",0

Wheel support is wonky out of the box, but I've got it tuned to an enjoyable-enough state.

This UX is awful.
If you buy a car pack, you need to go to your garage, go to the shop, filter by price, navigate to the 0 CR tab, select a car, wait for liveries to load/select a standard paint job, wait for the game to save, watch an unskippable cinematic, press back to go back to the menu with the store. FOR EVERY SINGLE CAR. If you buy any of the higher edition versions, in my case the Ultimate Edition, you'll probably need to do this like 50+ times.
I tried a macro, it didn't work. Guessing the game intentionally blocks stuff like that for anti-cheating reasons.

Also crashes occasionally.

Sometimes it'll lock to 30fps @ 4k when you have vsync on. I think it might only be if you launch via Steam Big Picture though.

Great selection/massive amount of cars.
Amazing looking.

4085,"""Car go vroom, and fast"" is what my friend said when I played Forza Horizon 4. But in all seriousness, they aren't wrong either.

There are a lot of cars - like really a lot and also there is so many things to do, you'll (probably) never run out of things to do in FH4. On the first day that I got this game, i clocked in around 8 hours, and that is very rare for me because I'll probably get bored after an hour or two. There is seasons (the whole map changes between the 4 seasons, giving advantage to certain types of cars - that do well in dirt or snow), and events that lets you win currency and awesome cars too!

Still not convinced, yeah I was too at first, until I clocked in my first 4 hours and realized that this game is a lot of fun - even without friends!",1

4116,"I found the performance, graphics, and gameplay acceptable and entertaining. However, all the NPCs and character avatars come off as obnoxious wankers. Seeing them dance around during loading screens gets old quick. This sets a tone of being more of a kid‚Äôs game rather than a kid friendly game. 

If you didn‚Äôt purchase all the expansions the game reminds you with 2 minute commercials and in-game menu reminders.

The real issue is that the online functionality is horrendous. The experience is not smooth compared to what we‚Äôre accustomed to in modern online titles. When playing online the open world stutters every few minutes. In addition, load times for online events can be 2-5 minutes long, completely unacceptable. Due to this I regret purchasing Forza Horizon 4. If possible, check it out on Game Pass.

This was my first experience with the Forza Horizon series and will likely be my last.

4124,"This is the first Forza title I have played, so I cannot compare it to anything previous, but having said that, this game is simply a blast to play, I love the mechanics of it, the graphics, the gameplay, the car customization and the amount of vehicles you can even choose from, and I love that they included some Mitsubishi vehicles like the 95 Eclipse in a FREE DLC pack! I'm a huge tuner fan and the Eclipse is one of my absolute favorite cars, so to see that I can use that car in game just makes this that much better for me.

I enjoy the racing genre a lot and from games like Need For Speed, Grand Tourismo, Initial D, among others, Forza has earned THE top spot from me, this game is just a lot fun and I'm hoping to eventually only increase my fun level with this whenever I can get a racing simulator setup. I know I'm late to this game, but if there's others out there like me who has been putting off the Forza series, I encourage you to go ahead and give this a try, rather you wait for a sale or pay full price, just get it. I paid full price and would gladly pay full price again.",1

[b]Rating: 9.5/10[/b]

At last, I can totally reviewed this game for positive review after making a negative one. This is probally the best arcade racing I've ever played besides NFS series.

[b]Pros[/b]

+ Stunning and beautiful graphics
+ A lot of manufacture cars to collect
+ Awesome gameplay, including the PvP
+ Great content with such updates
+ Would play this games all over again
+ Changing seasons with different rewards

[b]Cons[/b]
- I found the price is over 70 Euro in most countries, but not in Indonesia, which is pretty unfair
- Terrible game optimization, especially at first date launch

4144,"Very addictive. There are many more activities besides racing, and almost everything that you do is rewarded (even when you hit roadside objects), which then compels you into playing more and more. Quite accessible for casual players yet still challenging for dedicated gamers. Very beautiful graphics. However, the map is much smaller than The Crew 2.

PS: It's a semi-simulation. Use a steering wheel if you have one, so you can feel the physical forces acting on your wheels. Otherwise you might often lose control of the car.",1

I would not recommend this game at this time. If they patch the startup issues, I would consider re-purchasing.

UPDATE:  I'm changing my recommendation of this game with a caveat. There are still issues with the game. It does crash, but so far, for me, it has happened after 2-3 hrs playtime and only at transition to cut scene. (at that point I'm ready for a break anyway)
The startup was a nightmare, but the solution in the long run was very simple.

4192,"Personally, I did not have any fun with this title, but I can see why others would be. I've always only played arcade racers, from mario kart to more realistic titles, but this game's feel falls far outside anything that you'd be used to with arcade racers. The simulations of how each car drives is very interesting, but falls outside of what I'm used to, and it generally felt extremely hard to control anything, no matter what difficulty/assist or car settings I changed. 
In addition to that, the game seems to have a *lot* of baked-in music, which could be a serious issue if you stream, or even moreso if you really just want to listen to your own tunes. It's utterly impossible to turn off the music.
The only thing I really liked about this at all was the customization. The editor is incredible, and you can tune your cars to do just about whatever you want, and you can make them look just about however you want too, with incredibly in-depth appearance customization.

If you're a realistic simulation fan and you enjoy racing with such things, customizing your rides to hell and back, and listening to what the game throws at you, this is most certainly the title for you.

If you come from a background of arcade racers like Mario Kart, even to things like Burnout, this title may possibly rub you the wrong way. Exercise caution when jumping in and see if it feels the way you want it to.

If you have the same tastes as me, this game will be unsatisfying, frustrating, and will only provide some nice eye candy as you trick out your ride.",0

4212,"Okay, I have been looking forward to the day this title would come to Steam, since I am not a big fan of the Microsoft Store and love to have (most) of my games in one spot.

So now the day finally came and I am happy to be able to play this game the way I want to and on the platform I choose to.

At least I would be happy if this game weren't suffering from so many stupid flaws and bugs that seem to be exclusive to the steam version.

The state of the game on steam is somewhat comparable to the standard of a game that has just been released and is missing a ""first day patch"". Basic stuff like multiplayer invitations/convoys don't seem to work. There is a huge problem with the communication of this game and the (apparently mandatory) XBox App on Win 10. Also noone explains to you how to get this game working. This is a big let down compared to other titles like GTA that also requires third party software (aka a launcher).

Also the crashes. Don't get me started on those. They happen at random and usually in the least opportune moments.

All of this would be kinda acceptable if it weren't for the fact that this game has been out on PC for several years now and is basically in the process of finishing its life cycle. From what I have heard the next iteration of this series is around the corner.

To add insult to injury, this game is way overpriced for a 3 year old game.

I cannot recommend the steam version in its current state and I am hoping the devs behind will fix all of these unnecessary issues quickly. If they manage to do so until April, I am willing to give this game a thumbs up, because all things considered, it is amazing and now it finally came to Steam.

Now do your work devs.",0

4218,"This game is very good, the realism in the scenery is beautiful, the cars and their tunings are very customizable, and there are lots of events for multiplayer or solo experiences.

LIKES:
It's everything you want in a racing game: lots of events, challenges, and fun! The game is visually beautiful, including the change of the seasons, so even if it's the same map you get to do different things in different seasons. You can change your car's setup depending on the challenge or the season, and can get great setups from other players. There are challenges that are ""businesses"", in which you complete a chapter and then get credits the next time you login. For example, you can own a taxi, a delivery, or a car improvement business and if you get 3 stars in each of their chapters then you get profits. The multiplayer is amazing, you can see the ghosts of other players in the open road, can challenge them or ask them to join your convoy to take events/races together. Every single playing mode is fun; I bet I haven't mentioned them all, but this game is worth it.

DISLIKES:
The seasons are from Friday to Thursday, and sometimes I don't have time to finish all the season challenges. Maybe it's a personal problem, so you might do better than me. Also, you can't import images or logos to decorate the cars, so any realistic vinyl design you see is made by hand by other players, so appreciate their work.

I love that there is always something to do in this game, and it doesn't get repetitive; it took me 80hrs to post this review because I was having soooo much fun! You definitely should get it if you wanted the fun of NFS and the realism of Grand Turismo, plus with a great non-invasive multiplayer.",1

4225,"I've only had this game for three days and I can already say that this is one of the best games I've played, and that's coming from someone who doesn't usually play racing games. Starting with the graphics they are absolutely stunning for a game like this, the attention to detail on the crashed cars and the fact that your cars can actually interact with the space around you instead of just crashing instantly is great too. The soundtrack of the game is also some of the most well put together I've seen, from how the radio practically goes away when your going through tunnels to how it muffles when you go into the menu really gives you a feel of the effort the sound designers put into this. You also have radio hosts for each of the 5 (I think) radio stations who chat with the people listening and announce events that are going on in the world. The map, don't get me started on the map, it has so many different locations each with painstaking detail put into them, I feel like I'm traversing the map for the first time each and every time I drive across it. Now onto the gameplay because even if everything else is great a game can only be as good as the content in it. Your never gonna run out of things to do in this game. In the beginning before you become a horizon driver you already have access to most of what the game has to offer. You have Road, Dirt, Street, and Cross country racing, all ran by amazingly voice acted NPC's and many various campaigns you can do. Once you become a fully fledged horizon driver (About 6-7 hours of gameplay in) you get access to even more thing to do including but not limited to, multiplayer parties, #FORZATHON an event that lets you do various different minigames to earn rewards for the #FORZATHON shop, the battle royale gamemode; a race where you try to knock as many players into the ""storm"" as possible, and many other things that I don't have time to cover. If you do all of this and still aren't satisfied then you can settle on collecting, customizing, and optimizing cars for different, weather conditions, race formats, and styles of driving. Now onto the downsides of which I could only find two, those being the price and the fact that it occasionally crashes, I personally think that the price is the lesser of the two problems because you will totally be getting your moneys worth, now the crashing on the other hand really needs to be fixed, I'm not sure if its just my computer or what but I have lost about a half an hours worth of customizing my car to one of said crashes, causing me to totally restart I was able to recover though and I only lost 30 minutes so I'm fine with it.

It's been a month (April 2021) since i purchased this game and recently got 2 or 4 updates since then but, the game is still constantly stutters which is [U]UNACCEPTABLE[/U] for a racing game because it will ruin your pace on the track/road, atleast that's a really dealbreaker for me i don't know about others, and of course not to mention the game will always crash in a random moment.
Assetto Corsa with CSP+SOL mod and Project CARS 2 which is more demanding in general is actually more stable than this game so yeah.... that's sucks.

So in my advice wait for the game become stable first, wait for a discount then buy this game.
Will update my review if the game's actually become playable or stable for me. 
For now i give it a negative review first.",0

Still, you must do this correctly 20 times before you are scored to determine if there has been some error along the way. Then you must try again 20 more times. What fun.

4285,"A really compelling driving game with excellent graphics and nice gameplay. It runs smoothly on most hardware. It features changes in time of day, weather, and even seasons with tons of races and exploration both online and offline. It also has a huge selection of cars (almost 700), more than I have seen in any other game. You can also customise almost every aspect of your car from paint, to suspension, to engine, to tires.
The only thing I don't like is the music. I did not find a good selection of rock/metal in the game so I simply turned the radio off.
I really recommend this over FH5 for now, especially because this one is almost entirely bug-free. Also, this is more in-touch with reality compared to The Crew 2, so there's no switching between vehicles on the go. In fact, you only drive cars, no boats, no planes!",1

4287,"Impossible to get bored.
Getting bored of racing? Just drive around and do tasks.
Getting bored of driving around? Hop into a drift car and drift around.
Getting bored of drifting? drive through fields and woods and break stuff.
Getting bored overall? Take a break and design your car.
Getting bored of your favourite car? Tune it.

No motivation to win a race on a track you dont like? You don't even have to be first place to progress.
Need some action? Do stunts.
Wanna challenge yourself? There are drift tracks and speed cameras to beat your own scores.
Driving around not knowing what to do? Check the live event where you drive with others to win at tasks collectively.
Still getting bored like a b!t‚Ç¨h? Go do custom challanges / races with crazy custom tracks.
Still need motivation to play this? You constantly unlock stuff and win things, that'll give you enough dopamine for dead brain.

Now, the game is completely unplayable, even after creating a new admin profile on my PC and doing a clean 5 hr reinstall. 

Wheel is also completely broken on this one game specifically. Come on Microsoft, its a racing game. Maybe wheel and shifter support would be a good idea..?",0

4311,"Probably the best car-collecting and free-roaming game. Note that I haven't played FH5 yet.

The amount of cars available is insane, the sounds and handling feel different enough, the customization is pretty awesome and the map is big with a lot of variability.

The content and objectives are generally pretty addicting and push you to play to unlock stuff. BUT, the ""story"" and general game design feel is junky. It can definitely be overlooked though, since the amount and quality of the provided cars is amazing.

I am missing two major things, and I could very easily crown FH4 as the best racing game I have played:
1. Racing SUCKS. (lol)
The car handling is too arcade-y, and the wheel support is very lackluster.
2. The game is missing some track racing. It is basically road or dirt racing, but I would love to see some real-world asphalt tracks (e.g. F1) or some rally stages! Especially rally would be amazing, since the handling would most probably fit better on the gameplay of FH4.

On the minor side, the soundtrack is also pretty bad, with only some of the songs on the ""radio"" being of my taste. I would love the ability to have a custom radio station, since I mostly had to go with the Classical radio station for my chilling rides, or with radio off for racing.

Overall, the game is amazing. Buying the Ultimate-super-duper edition is essential since it adds two pretty big maps, new objectives and cars. A sale of 50% (or more) is absolutely worth it, since the pricing is pretty steep.

An easy 8/10.",1

A developer post a trouble shooting guide on how to fix the issue (its a lengthy list) Which wants you to disable a lot other applications to include OS programs, delete programs and reinstall reprograms. I'm sorry but when you have paragraph's of conflicting software's, its a huge turn off. I have requested a refund at this time and i highly suggest anyone who wants to get the game either go though Microsoft directly, play it on an xbox or wait until they fix the issues but who know how long that will be cause almost every company is using the new excuse ""due to covid-19"" So good luck to anyone who decides to get the game

4338,"Unless you are masochist, avoid at all costs.

It won't even let you start the game unless you have a Microsoft account. If you don't have it, you have to make one, otherwise you can't play the game. If you try to make one, you have to give it your email address and personal data. Then it sends you a verification mail and code, which you then enter to proceed. But no, it's still suspicious, so it wants you to go through a series of mindnumbingly idiotic tests created by a person who is obviously mentally sick and malevolent and wants you to fail those tests no matter what. You have to rotate images it gives you to a correct position. However the images are mostly of completely inrecognizable objects and shapes that make no sense, so I don't get it how any human being can figure out how to rotate those images to whatever is the right rotation. And you have to do three of these rotating images in a row without a single mistake, otherwise you have to repeat it all over again. I am a graphic designer with 20/20 vision and after 17 tries I could not even figure out what these shapes are, let alone what their correct orientation is. So it gives you an alternative. It will let you download some audio files, and then you have to determine which one of the songs played is the ""saddest"". Again, three attempts and not a single one can fail otherwise you have to repeat it for eternity until you get it right. However, the ""download audio"" button doesn't work so it won't download any music so you can't determine which song is the ""saddest"" and you can't lucky-guess it three times in a row.
So I'm basically locked out of a game that I paid full price for, because I can't pass some ridiculously obfuscated tests, after being accused of being a robot.
So I'd say, the typical customer experience one should expect as usual when being stupid enough to purchase anything from a cancer of a company that is Microsoft.",0

4340,"Forza Horizon 4 is a good racing game for people who don't like racing games.

That might sound appealing to a lot of people & from all the positive reviews there is obviously an audience for this type of game. FH4 does a lot of things well, the production quality is high, there's a large variety of cars, a large open map to explore, the physics/driving model is good for an arcade racer. The problem comes down to the races themselves and the lack of incentive to do well in them. The races are short and have been designed to cater to an audience that want instant gratification with very little commitment. This results in a game lacking depth in what should be it's main area of gameplay, this is somewhat countered by a map covered in events (such as finding barn finds, jumps, breaking signs) all designed for people who again aren't interested in the racing itself.

This game will appeal to a lot of people, however if you're after a racing game where you're looking to put in a bit of effort to learn tracks and improve your racing ability look elsewhere.",0

4354,"This feels like a kid's racing game. The racing itself is fine, although as a past Gran Turismo driver I find this title a bit of a letdown on that front. Everything else about it, the presentation, the sorta story you're shoveled, the ""need"" for ""influence,"" the seasons, even the radio DJs - it all reeks of trying too hard to register with a very specific and very immature audience. The reward cars come with almost no effort. Races to use particular cars are hard if not impossible to find. When tuning, either I can't test particular builds or I haven't figured out how to test particular builds - either of which should be obviously in the game. I feel like adjusting car mechanics should have a way to either see what changes or feel what changes through driving. Neither option appears to exist without leaving the car modification screen. 

It all feels very casual. It feels like it took ingredients of good racing games and piled them into a colorful, noisy package that gradually drops dozens of cars in your lap with no call to use any of them.",0

If the old game, which worked fine on gamepass for pc for several years and huundreds of hours (ultra/high settings), now cannot handle low settings on a better computer on steam, why would I consider buying fh5 from steam at all? If you're mainly on steam, honestly don't bother with any forza games, play them from gamepass. Get a game more like assetto corsa on steam. At least it works, multiplayer actually functions properly, mod support, real tracks, etc. At least right now, this game is not worth the hassle even for people who have 3080s and above. I love forza horizon, but a lot of players just notice that the little problems add up and make it just a disgusting disappointment. for a game that came out over 4 years ago.",0

4384,"The developers spend more time designing dances and bloody gloves than actually making a long and enjoyable game. Some tracks are mostly impossible to have a clean race at, since they will eventually put a puddle on a bloody curve just so you can either loose a clean race streak or lower the difficulty. I spend 200 hours on Forza Horizon 2, and I didn't quite finish. The map was big and there were different tracks for the same part of the map. This one here it is shameful that to this day they charge you the money that they do, for a game that if I didn't know about it, I would say it was still on beta, with tracks (specially on the DLCs) that it is clear no one ever tested them before going public. The obnoxious talking no stop is unskipable, the reward can be a bloody honk (the which I never see anyone using and it has the same use as if Formula 1 game would have one). ""You can make your own avatar"" Who asked for that? I payed for a race game, not a bloody The Sims on Wheels! Most rewards you get is for building your character the which it is not what I was there for. Just buy GTA V, because at the very least you can race, there are more options of cars, and you can also shoot something.

4395,"Great balance between arcade and sim, with a decent and varied reward system that keeps you coming back for more. The simulation is good enough for you to get a feel for the many types of cars you can try, but it leans enough on the arcade side to be exhilarating. The rewards you get along the way provide incentive to keep coming back. More cars, more outfits, more funny horns. This is a great racing game.",1
4396,"[b] Long Story Short: The game is good but the UI and the narrative is pure garbage, filled with stupid nonsense.[/b]

[b] My rating: 7/10 [/b]

[hr] [i][b]Explanation[/b][/i] [/hr]

I like arcade racing games. Fast cars, quick corners, compete against friends, feel the thrill of speed in an open world setting that's my thing. While FH4 ticks almost all of my boxes, I would like to talk about something else, [b] The UI [/b]

The menus of this game are super confusing. Specially if you're someone who is just getting started, you will find yourself overwhelmed with menus after menus after menus (menus never end eh!) with very little to no explanation for each of them. Even after spending like 20 hours in the game, I still feel confused. I couldn't find any [u]""information tab""[/u] in the game that lets you review what each menus are for.

When I was a few hours in the game, I tried to get some new cars, figured that it require ""backstage pass."" I didn't have enough backstage pass and the game instructed ""you need to be a roaster driver to earn more backstage pass."" Now, how do I become a roaster driver? No explanation. I had to ask another player to figure that out.

Now, regarding the UI. There are literally 1000 menus in the game. Each menu contain 500 sub-menus which contains more garbage inside. Seems like the developers cannot streamline anything. You can't expect nicer UI and organized information from a Microsoft owned developer anyway.",1
4397,"Before i played Forza Horizon 4, i had a small wee-wee, no friends, no girlfriend, depression,and absolutely no life. These things haven't changed, but the game is pretty good.",1
4398,"great open world racing game. But ""online adventure"" mode is loading too long",1
4399,–ë,1
4400,Worth it !,1
4401,"It's a decent driving game when the POS actually decides to load, but usually you can't even get in-game at all since you're just frozen on a black screen. Not until AFTER the developers spam you with the unskippable intro videos of course, we need to get those in beforehand right?. When you finally do get the trash to boot up fully, you'll have kissed half your day goodbye, as you'll have wasted it waiting for this garbage to load. 

Once you're in the game proper, prepare for the unskippable cutscene spam and crappy music. Don't waste your money on this tripe, not even at a discount. Go buy GRID instead, it's actually worth paying for unlike this rancid pile of filth. One last thing, i read someones review saying the game was 'surprisingly well optimised' before i bought in to it, don't listen to that moron. It's not exactly cryostasis level unoptimised, but even when turning the settings down from ultra to medium, the game is still trying its best to fry my GPU, despite the FPS being locked to 60.",0
4402,better than nfs,1
4403,"Just get it, don‚Äôt think about it. Click buy and enjoy. 

In all seriousness I haven‚Äôt bothered reviewing any other game across multiple steam accounts but this one deserves it. The map is beautiful, you don‚Äôt even have to enjoy racing, just driving around will kill several hours. The races are nice too, I don‚Äôt think they have as much intensity as NFS Heat did but the visuals and overall smoothness of the vehicles more than makes up for it.

I‚Äôll admit there is a bit of FPS drops/stuttering when changing scenes but it goes away pretty quick and it does not take away from the experience at all. My only regret is not getting the ultimate edition. 

It‚Äôs really a must buy if you‚Äôre a fan of racing games",1

I encountered the following problem - Beyond the title screen my Xbox controller would not work, unless you count the Xbox button

So I don't think everyone is having this problem but me I need to play with a controller and not a keyboard and, again while this doesn't seem to affect everyone with the whole Cyberpunk 2077 furore, this is unacceptable and I'm very disappointed with the game.  I have spent more time trying to troubleshoot the game (of which I am still trying), than I have enjoying the game :(",0

The graphics look great, even at the lowest settings. The mechanics are great, the sound is awesome ((Each terrain has its own sound + tyre sound + Engine sound). An immersive experience!
Ton of cars, customisation options and a friendly community!

4506,"The game looks great, and I'm convinced that the open world is a great idea for a racing game. With that being said, there are too many small and big gripes that keep Forza from being a great game.

There is next to no progression. You unlock cars and races, sure. But what's the difference between one race and another one in this game? But what's the point of unlocking yet another car, when you get all types of cars including supercars very early in the game anyway? It's not like you can collect them all anyway, since some are hidden behind paid DLC and others behind achievements that would require you to devote your life to the game.

The game wants to shower you with content, with a clear emphasis on quantity over quality. Some of that content is just plain unenjoyable (hello drift points!). But what's even worse is the constant paid DLC wall. I don't necessarily mind DLCs, when I don't get the feeling that they're being forced on me. When you're looking for another car to get in the game, the ones locked by paid DLC are there with the others. On the map, you have events appearing that are locked behind paid DLC. Even worse, you sometimes get unskippable video ads for paid DLC. I'm also slightly irritated by how the game also tries to force multiplayer down my throat.

Finally, I want to stress two immersion-breaking issues. The first one is that the steering wheels in the cockpit view in game only turn 90¬∞ on either side (180¬∞ arc total). If you're playing with a steering wheel controller, there's no visual indication of how you are turning the wheel beyond those 90¬∞. And yet turning your steering wheel further than 90¬∞ actually has an effect on how sharp a turn you're making. The second one is the broken sense of speed. The speedometer tells you that you're doing 180km/h on a small country road, and yet it looks like you're driving maybe 80km/h max. The speeds displayed are absolutely ludicrous, but it feels nowhere that fast.

The final issue that I want to point out, though it is rather minor, is how corny and cringeworthy the dialogue is in this game.

I'm still looking forward to trying FH5 to see how many of these issues have gotten better (or worse) because there is great potential in that game.",0

The menu system is confusingly designed + the car build is not clear, sometimes when looking at it, I don't know how to build the car.

I haven't been able to access anything online in-game for a week now, which is like half of the game's features. I can't complete daily goals, use the auction house, share and download tunes, nothing. Forza's tech support is absolutely atrocious, and they will simply close your ticket without even responding to it. Even a ""we're aware of the problem and are working to fix it"" would be better than nothing, but they won't even admit the problem is on their end.

I bought this game specifically to play with a wheel, I'm sure it plays fine with a controller but thats not what I want to play it with. This is almost as bad as codemasters and what they did with Dirt 5. Why would you knowingly release a racing game thats 2 years old without proper wheel support? I don't know, but I can't play this game as is so I can't in good conscience give this a thumbs up. My issues with my fanatec setup are the same as everyone else, shit just doesn't work. At one point it seemed like my clutch and gas were stuck in the incorrect axis, and whenever I tried to remap my controls it would automatically assign it to a random button. Now after the first patch update my pedals don't respond at all, gear shifter still doesn't respond, but at least my wheel turns? No force feedback though.  The 85 minutes I've played in this game were me troubleshooting my wheel, then using a controller to get past the intro because you can't skip the opening cutscene, then trying to troubleshoot after I've made my character and chosen my car.",0
4540,Fair price for the bundle,1
4541,"Best Racing Game Ever, PERIOD!!!!!!!!",1
4542,"Would I buy it again? Yes.
Would I buy it again for full price? Hell no! Wait for discount otherwise not worth it.

The game is well made, racing is fun and graphics is cool.
But the price tag is horribly high for this game. And if you don't buy all DLCs together with the game be prepared to see an advertisement for missing DLCs everywhere you go. It's so extreme that some events from DLCs are appearing on the map and once you arrive there it tells you to buy it. Sometimes advertisement appears after you finish the race and it can't be skipped. This would annoy me even in a free game... can't believe such s**t can be in a game with 70EUR pricetag.

Another very bad aspect of the game is it's singleplayer. The concept is just so extremely dull I can't believe this everytime I start the game. The whole point of this game is farming influence points (which basically just means ""points"" but influence sounds cooler I guess). These points are rewarded for everything you do in the game. You don't have to win a race, you just have to... finish it. Yes right, not kidding, this racing game is not about winning it's about ""doing something""... no matter what. I managed to qualify myself for an event by simply driving around and destroying things like trees, walls, greenhouses... (because even that earns you points and not just a few). Sometimes you also get a car for free or some other crap for free. And if you are still too lame to earn something (which is basically impossible as long as you are able to press ""W"") there is some kind of spinning wheel or whatever which earns you extra random crap just for free. (sometimes free car, sometimes cash, sometimes some cosmetic crap). So basically whole singleplayer is just designed for the biggest losers in the world => because here you get rewarded for being one.

Forza Horizon 4 is an amazing game.  Its so amazing I don't mind the price and I have no issue starting over.

Long pauses (sometimes more than a few seconds) when finishing a race or transitioning to a cut scene.  Stutter in cut scenes.  Stutter with Dual Sense, stutter with XBox Elite S2.

4553,"The game itself is a masterpiece, best arcade racing game you can find in the market, BUT after the last update 3mo ago the game is full of bugs and crashes, you can't join your friend convoy without crashing, sometimes the game get stuck in the loading screen before and after the races and the devs doesn't seem to care cause forza 5 is just around the corner. U can check the community, majority of posts are about unfixed bugs.

So if u don't care about restarting this game, cause u will be doing this a lot just go for it",0

4556,"""I bought a th8a shifter and it works on Assetto Corsa, Dirt Rally 2.0, etc... When I try to map the gears on FH4 it is undetected. Gears are detected in the control panel and the drivers are up to date. Not sure what is happening but it is pretty frustrating."" - From a user on Reddit, I too have this exact same problem and many others as well, I have seen posts about this even from when the game first came out! If you have a handbrake or shifter you will not be able to use it as this game does not support multi usb function. Quite annoying  considering this is a racing sim. Not to mention the TMX isn't even supported for a cherry on top. I honestly was really hyped to play this and blew $100 on the ultimate edition but it ended up being just to use a wheel with no force feedback and no accessories.

TL:DR: Any other sim is better than this due to the fact you are unable to see a list of devices (shifter,handbrake) and input them as needed, only your wheel (':",0

4575,"How to relax after the hard day:

1. Start Forza Horizon 4.
2. Turn off the in-game radio.
3. Choose one of the *enormous* amount of (not only) Japanese cars available in the game.
4. Turn eurobeat on.
5. Get rolling!
6. (Optionally) Join some racing events to win more Japanese cars or whatever suits you better.

Jokes apart, this game is a must-have for an automobile geek like me (and I'm an average one). But be aware that it's not that refundable: 2 hours is about half way through the first season, meaning the game doesn't show you a fraction of what it is at this point. So choose wisely!

P. S.: Whoever in the development team thought it's a great idea to loop the music, so it doesn't change during the race, was horribly wrong.",1

4578,"It's been a while since I play a good open world racing game. This one certainly brings back the classic feeling of open-world racing game, I rack up so many hours in just two days of playing! Totally worth the money even without discount.


P.S I have no idea what people are talking about crashing and stuff, but my Forza runs fine with minimal issues and lags",1
4579,very beautiful,1
4580,"I would put this as a neutral review if I could. The core gameplay with the cars and races themselves is incredibly fun ; absolutely no complaints there. The open world touch helps tie everything together as well -- I used to explain that Just Cause 2 was my favorite ""Get from Point A to Point B Simulator"" because the best part of the game was setting a random waypoint on the map, spawning in whatever vehicle tickled your fancy at the time (there were some good mods that let you airdrop vehicles in JC2 like the devs worked into the official JC3 game). Forza Horizon 4 scratches the same ""Get From Point A to Point B"" itch (cars only), but adds a lot of other fun unlockables on top of everything else.

So why the 'neutral' review? Because outside of the core gameplay with cars / races, it feels like literally everything else was an afterthought. Will try summarizing the things that legitimately just made me angry while playing the game:
(1.) I use a wired connection to my router and get ‚âà300Mbps download and ‚âà 260Mbps upload. That should be more than okay to play the game, but still constantly get stuttering and see cars pause in place and then slingshot forward while playing online. Assuming most of this is done serverside, so my own internet speeds may not factor in admittedly.
(2.) The main menu / GUI is the most atrociously-designed / horribly-laid-out menu I've ever used in a video game. And there's no way around needing to use it all the time. Even at around the 10Hr playtime mark, I still sometimes had to flail around in the menu before I found the area that had what I was searching for.
(3.) There are far too many unskippable cutscenes in between events and when areas of the overworld map are being unlocked. If you don't have certain DLC, the game occasionally plays advertisements in the middle of the game that you purchased for said DLC. Never should a non-free-to-play game EVER advertise in the middle of its game.
(4.) The Super-7 'challenge editor' -- which is the track editor that players can use to create custom objectives and then upload for other players to attempt -- is a fantastic concept that is completely ruined by its horrible implementation. Like I wasn't even planning on creating a bunch of challenges, but I wanted to try it at least once. From that experience, I can guarantee I will never use it again. What I've found out:
...(4a.) Your challenge is 'locked into' using whatever car you were driving when you opened the 'Super 7' menu. After you're done creating your challenge, there is no way to designate the car from your garage that you want other challengers to use if they come across your upload.
...(4b.) Similarly, the 'starting point' of the challenge is locked into the exact location your vehicle was at when you opened the 'Super 7' menu. There is no way to move the starting point after you've started making your challenge.
...(4c.) You set the 'ending point' of the challenge by selecting a point on the FH4 map GUI, BUT the ending point 100% HAS TO BE on a paved road or a dirt road. This means you can't create custom off-road challenges, which is astounding to me because a huge part of the game are the ""Cross-Country"" races which are exactly that -- across the open country NOT on paved roads or dirt roads.
...(4d.) When you 'pindrop' the cursor on the map to choose the ending point of the challenge, the game just sort of guesses what you were aiming for. And if you're picking up on a theme here, it is impossible to change the 'ending location' of the challenge after it's placed.
...(4e.) 'Waypoints' -- another huge feature of the game (to force players to stay on an intended route) -- CAN'T be set for these custom challenges. So the devs clearly understood why these are useful in the core game, but didn't think that they would be useful for the custom challenges? It's baffling.
...(4f.) There is literally no 'Save' feature for your custom challenges. You have to suffer through the horrible editor all in one sitting (good luck), and nothing from your custom challenge will save from that sitting unless you upload the challenge at the end.
...(4g.) And I don't even think I need to say it at this point, but: no, you can't edit a challenge after you've uploaded it ; nor can you load an existing challenge as the starting point of a newly-created challenge ; you start from scratch every time.
(5.) Online Adventure: This is the unranked online group play (PvP). I dunno if Microsoft / Xbox Game Studios just gave up on their servers or something, but I have yet to finish one of these because the loading times at the start of every successive race are (without exaggeration) somewhere between 15-20min. And you have to do, at minimum, (3x) races to finish one adventure.
...(5a.) I bought this with my cousins to play multiplayer co-op in a small group, so I wouldn't normally care about Online Adventure, but the weekly 'challenges' / 'quests' (whatever you want to call them) apparently force you play Ranked Adventure, which you can only play if you get to 'Level 3' on the Online (Unranked) Adventure.
...(5b.) There are car rewards that are locked behind getting to a certain percentage-completion of the Weekly 'challenges' / 'quests', so when you factor in everything above, it's a pretty frustrating situation.
...(5c.) Just Google search ""forza horizon 4 online adventure load times"" for a sense of what I'm describing.
(6.) When searching through the list of your auctions placed in the Auction House, there's no way to reorder the list (where sorting by 'time ending soonest' would be ideal...). Instead the game locks your list of auctions in chronological order of when you placed the bids without an option to re-order.
(7.) For online play, you can't selectively mute the players that are in your session, so you'll often get stuck with someone with a hot mic blasting obnoxious music in the background and you can't mute them specifically. Another option that is very obviously needed and should have been straightforward to implement, but completely missed by Playground.
(8.) On the topic of muting sounds, there is no ""mute"" option for the in-game music (which isn't amazing...). The game settings have a ""music"" volume slider that goes from ""1"" (lowest) to ""10"" (highest). Like why is there not a ""Volume 0"" option for the music? Why is the lowest music volume setting ""1"" and not ""0""? Also, the music volume slidebar is ONLY tied to the radio station music that plays while driving ; it does NOT mute the obnoxious music that plays during loading screens.
...(8a.) Again, there are no options to mute (or even turn down) the music during loading screens. At least for the radio station music, you can change the station to ""OFF"", but the game doesn't save your Radio Station preference to ""OFF"", so every time you get into a new car, you have to cycle through stations before you get back to ""OFF"" again. It's like the devs/publisher wanted to force you to listen to the music just because they had to pay licensing fees to get it in the game, regardless of whether you enjoy it or not.

Verdict: Forza Horizon 4 is a fun game, and I will probably continue to play it. I think it could have been a 10/10 game if the entire development time wasn't spent solely on the cars. Everything in the game BUT the cars feels like a complete afterthought the team slapped onto the game just so that they could market FH4 as having 'all of these exciting new features that previous Forza titles didn't have', as a marketing campaign that looks goods on paper. This game is simultaneously both fun and painful. I think all of the negatives take it down to a 6/10, hence the 'neutral' review that I wish Steam would have let me give it.",0

just driving around town is worth enough to buy the game :D

4586,"[h1]Tour de Forza of Racing![/h1]
For years i had heard about the Forza series of racing games. For years I had heard about how they were pushing the boundaries of the racing genre. With their Motorsport series neck and neck with the best of the [i]Gran Turismos[/i] and then came along the Horizon series whipping dirt up on EA's now sad state of [i]Need for Speed[/i] titles. I had waited long and hard for the day that they'd finally drop on my doorstop (√† la Steam of course) so that I'd finally soak all that virtual motor oil in and hit the pedal to the metal. 

Immediately upon the introduction, I was put in the seat of the action driving multiple types of vehicles across multiple seasons with absolutely astounding backdrops and a mirage of vehicles beside me whilst a jet would whoosh on by to a pumping soundtrack. Heart pounding, Blood rushing. Eyes watering. I was ready for more of all this baby! 50 hours later and I still feel the same way at times. 

Simply one of the best racing experiences I've had in a long time, it's not hard to understand why the series has grown to be iconic and legendary as it has now in a relatively short amount of time compared to NFS or the GTs. The driving just feels so tight and satisfying, you're able to fine tune everything to the most minute of details. Car culture aficionados are going to have a ball just tinkering around with the 752 !! Cars that are available to them , all customizable and ready to be played with. Social features integrated into all of this so fluidly, you're able to upload all your kits and share what you've done, it just works as they say. 

The environment, set in a condensed representation of Great Britain, is beautiful with of course lots of countryside to drive around as well as smaller regions and cities such as Edinburgh, the Scottish Highlands, Ambleside, Cotswold etc. I do wish there were bigger urban environments to mess around in but the Horizon series has always been known for their fantastic outdoor, country still adventures so no complaints. The dynamic seasonal system at play here is a superb addition as well, adding variety to the game and really making it feel as though you're in a real environment and world. Can't help but mention as well that the music selection is fantastic and I thoroughly enjoy coasting through the game, all chill, just listening to the tunes - it's therapeutic even. 

I haven't spent much time with the games' multiplayer features however the couple of rounds that I have spent in the Eliminator (racing battle royale) were supremely fun, challenging and especially satisfying in edging out opponents and such. I did have regular disconnections to the games' servers for whatever reason even with my gigabit connection, so that soured me a little on experiencing it more but otherwise I still had a lot of fun!

Forza Horizon 4 is the pinnacle of arcade racing titles and honestly with Forza Horizon 5 out now, I still implore everyone to give this title a go as well. Give 'em all the $$s. Can't wait to experience more Horizon Festivals across the globe!",1

I've tried this for several hours now. The real challenge (and actual good rewards) start after 5 repetitive races, about 4 of which will either be a small strip near the horizon center or one paticular motorway. Then, due to PG's & MS's goodwilled nature, you will be graciously given 3 attempts to beat 2 races that are actually different and actually difficult. Whoever greenlit this deserves to lose their job. Oh, and the rewards are an exclusive car and an exclusive ticket. In a 100‚Ç¨ game. I'd expect that of Asphalt or Dirt, but this game?

4614,"[h1][b]Welcome to Forza Horizon 3-- Err, 4![/b][/h1]
 Oh god. Forza Horizon 4. Good fucking christ, this game. I'll be honest, I've experienced games that give me whiplash every so often. Never once has it been a racing game. I've played Forza Motorsports 1, 4 and 6 (Hated the ass out of 6), and every Horizon title so far.

Of the Horizon games, this is easily the worst. Allow me explain why. As usual I'll start with the nice stuff first and gradually open more and more of the ass cheeks of this game until all the shit comes flying out like the Fukushima Reactor Plant.

[h1][b]It's working! IT'S WORK-ING![/b][/h1]

So, the first hurdle to overcome is naturally making sure the game works. I have a BEEFY PC: Radeon RX 5700 XT, Ryzen 7 3700X, 64 GB DDR4 RAM... And for some reason, it would crash if I set the aliasing too high, which was a little weird. Outside of that, it runs smoother than better on a pancake.

The racing... Actually feels great. Street and road races feel wonderful, Rally races feel like a blast in an all-wheel drive, and Cross-country courses are a relatively good romp too. However....

[h1][b]I think that robot is CHEATING.[/b][/h1]
The AI are... Schizophrenic at best. I regularly race on Highly Skilled. For some reason, if you're ahead enough of the pack, they'll suddenly got HYPER-competitive and rubber band toward you like they're set to Expert. Don't worry, I'm about to get to the difficulty too:

[h1][b]WHY AM I HAVING SKILL ISSUES!?[/b][/h1]
So, let's start off with... Okay, fuck it, EVERYTHING.

So first, Drivatar (Opponent) difficulty:
New Racer
Inexperienced
Average (Minimum difficulty for seasonal championships in the Lego Speed Champions DLC)
Above Average
Highly Skilled (Recommended difficulty for base game Seasonals)
Expert (Recommended difficulty for Fortune Island Seasonals)
Pro
Unbeatable (Standard difficulty for all Trial races)

You can also turn on and off various driving assists, such as the Assisted Breaking System, setting the steering to whatever you like, Turning off Traction Control and Stability Control, Setting your shifting from automatic to some CRAZY shit like manual with a clutch, Setting your driving line to be only visible during turns when you're going too fast or removing it altogether... You get the idea. Hell, you can even turn on damage! You can have it be cosmetic or, just like steering, set it to simulation. And lastly, there's a Rewind system, which was introduced in Forza Motorsport 3.

I run with all the driving assists off with automatic shift and a full driving line. It's nice to have those perks. If you're wondering abour Seasonals, allow me to explain...

[h1][b]PREPARE FOR ILLINOIS.... IN ENGLAND![/b][/h1]

... Okay, it's the United Kingdoms, but still. Anyway, Forza Horizon 4 introduces seasons as its newest mechanic in the game. Each weak the season changes. And every four seasons, a new racing series starts up: Summer > Autumn > Winter > Spring. In that order. And if you're worried, fret not, the DLCs are affected by this rule too.

Spring, Summer and Autumn can basically all be held in the same category whereas Winter is in its own little place like Horizon 3's Blizzard Mountain. Not too many people like snow in racing games, and I don't blame them. I for one have a weakness for offroading, and Winter makes offroad races a TON of fun. Now back to the seasonal bit...

Seasonal Events. These have been introduced in Horizon 4 to dramatically increase the game's longevity. And it works, surprisingly! You usually have One four-chapter car challenge worth 100 Forzathon points (I'll explain those later), A photo Op challenge, 7 daily Forzathon challenges that unlock with each day (and expire if you don't get on top of them fast enough '=_=) The Trial Race (Team of players versus team of Unbeatable level Drivatars), A playground games event (Basically PvP. You don't HAVE to win to get the reward), 3 Seasonal PR Stunts (Danger Sign, Speed Trap and Speed Zone), 3 or 4 racing championships, and occasionally, a Seasonal Showcase, which is fairly neat-o. But I'll get to the FUCKING showcases soon enough, I have some shit to say about them... And then finally, Monthly Rivals and Online Adventure.

[h1][b]The Showcases... Oh god no, the Showcases...[/b][/h1]

I. Fucking. Hate. Horizon 4's. Showcases. The first one you get is the worst of the five. A giant-ass hoverboat you have to actively contend with. See, the problem I had with the showcases is, because I'm usually pretty good at the game, I'm always ahead of the pack. ...In Horizon fucking 4, that can bite your fragile asscheeks off and send you into a livid rage during most of the Showcase events. The first one especially. See, I can't explain the bullshit with words and do it enough justice, but in my effort I shall try anyway. For some reason, the boat seems to push objects away from it whenever they get to close... Problem with that is, it's an enormous fucking penis in the way that often obstructs you, and if you're in the path it's sliding around toward, prepare to lose the race. Over and over again. Seriously, FUCK the hoverboat race. I hope that thing goes to the River of Styx and never escapes. It belongs there, truly.

There's better, but the review would be too long if I went into detail unfortunately.

[h1][b]FINAL BOSSES! OH GOD![/b][/h1]

Well... Not quite final bosses. More like ultimate races you can unlock for each category: Road Racing, Rally, Offroad, Dragracing, and the favored final boss every Horizon fan can never get enough of since Horizon 3: The Goliath. A single lap around the entire map.

[h1][b] WHAT ABOUT THE DLC!?[/b][/h1]

The DLC is... In a WEIRD fucking place for me. I guess I'll start with Fortune Island first, though.

Fortune Island is fun as hell. A rally racer and offroader's wet dream. You can gain a net-total of about 8 million credits here, assuming you don't have the cars you need foir all the riddle challenges. As well, the map itself is just fun to go hogwild on. It has two final races, a Goliath and Gauntlet style race. Not much else I can say. It's fun... A lot more fucking fun than the Lego Expansion...

Lego Speed Champions... Lego. Fucking. Speed Champions... The concept didn't sound appealing. The execution made me want to commit defibrilator-ribcage. The requirements made me want to go on a fucking crusade with the Imperium of Man to destroy all the heretics and xenos. Let me just... Fucking preficy LSC with this: EVERYTHING is mandatory to unlock the last race. And yes, even the Bonus Boards. Doesn't sound so fun, does it? Just wait until you do it. For me it felt like slogging through Warframe, but I already had I wanted to start. Horrible alternative radio, fucking cars made of legos... I hated it. A lot.

[h1][b]Clothes! Yes... Clothes.[/b][/h1]

Yeah... Clothes. Fuck me crying, clothes. What in hell do clothes have to do with a goddamned racing game again? I don't know, but it's pretty offensive. I'm going to address this shit right now. The clothes pretty much clog up the wheel spins. Getting clothes or emotes for your character equates to getting nothing to me. Even garbage from a landfill is a better award than clothes from Wheelspins.

[h1][b]Was it THAT bad!?[/b][/h1]
Honestly? No. It wasn't that bad. The WHIPLASH was that bad. Over all, Forza Horizon 4 certainly isn't a bad game. In fact, despite the ass-ripping I've given it, I still highly recommend it to people curious about the franchise who missed out on Horizon 3. The racing is fun, the car variety is truly insane, and despite my misgivings toward Lego Speed Champions, it DOES have some good race courses in there if you can find them. My favorite's at the bottom-right section of the map.

All in all, I give Forza Horizon 4 a 6 out of 10. It could have done better, but easily did more than good enough to keep me playing for a good while. A shame Horizon 5's racing wasn't good compared to its awesome... Everything else. Damn.",1

Negative reviews are whining about 2 things, the price and the fact that existing owners don't get it for free/discounted on Steam.

As far as price goes, ya'll could have waited until there was a sale. They're also not forcing you to purchase the game on Steam if you already own it on the Microsoft Store, So why would you expect a free Steam version or a discounted version?

Turns out there's this thing called TEREDO which you can find if you search for Xbox Networking in windows. Teredo sits under NAT type and randomly, the NAT type decides to tell you that Teredo is unable to qualify. What does that mean? It means you paid 60 GBP for a single player game with limited progression due to a Microsoft Server issue that they are incapable of fixing.

And yes, I've tried all the possible fixes (there are quite a significant amount of polls and threads opened just search for TEREDO is unable to qualify FH4) and guess what? All their replies are going around in loops telling you to do the same things over and over again - insanity!

TL;DR - If you buy this game, although its graphically nice and works quite well with g29 etc, you may have an issue with Xbos Networking where Teredo is unable to qualify which will instantly make your game into a single player limiting the content you can play.

4688,"It really hyped you up at the start but as soon as you get into it, it becomes a really mediocre racing game.

In singleplayer, there isn't really any sense of progression as you get hypercars extremely quick due to the lootbox system. Thankfully there are no lootbox microtransactions but it's an irritating system as it's unironically your primary source of income and cars.

The multiplayer is legitimately one of the worst I've experienced from a AAA game in recent memory. The various seasonal gimmicks (slipper fall, slippery winter) as well as a system that doesn't allow you to choose the race type (can't specifically choose if you want to do ranked circuit racing, can get dirt racing and offroad) can be super irritating if you just want to race without gimmicks. Ranked matchmaking forces you to play for 30 to 1 hour in one sitting, which can be a huge issue given the instability of multiplayer as well as the instability of the game itself. About 20% of matches I've played in resulted in freezing, disconnects, or crashes which literally happen with no other games. In most case the freezing is serverside because the system can wait up to 5 minutes to wait for a player to connect, then 5 minutes for that player to load in. 

It's honestly okay if you want a casual arcade racing experience but otherwise it can be painful.",0

After about 5 days, I opened steam to play another game when i noticed Forza was queue'd for download.

My region is blessed with regional pricing, thus making the game significantly cheaper compared to other areas. This AAA game is priced like an indie game here. Moreover, an added discount make it a no-brainer that I should buy this game. The rest is history.

4 days into buying the game, and I already reached level 100. I love every minute of it.

This game is marketed towards casual gamer, so it's fairly easy even on hardest AI difficulty. Dirt Rally and Project Cars series are much more difficult compared to this game. If you love casual racing game with compelling multiplayer features, this game is a must have.

Purchased FH4 via Steam as I buy my other titles from them, yet they did not make clear that they had removed all Wheel support from the settings menu. I do not own a controller as I use on a PC, I use a Logitec G29 wheel, pedals, gear stick. (All are working and installed correctly and in daily use on ATS/ETS2) .Yet they offer guides for wheel settings, but not how to initially install. They refused a refund the next day so that I could purchase from another supplier that has wheel support, due to 4 hours of use, most of that was trying to find out how to setup the wheel and Sim-Dashboard, not game play!

There is no way you can appeal or come to that even contact Steam to discuss things, everything is automated response with no ability to respond.  They have not offered any help or assistance, or any go-arounds to return the option they have removed.

4752,"Ignore my Steam time.  I've had this on the MS store since launch, but also wanted to buy it here on Steam.  I'm not sure what to say about this game to be honest.  I like it and I also can't stand it.

Pro's:
- Lots of  cars
- Customization
- Housing
- Drag, Drift, Street, Circuit, Sprint races
- Showcase events
- Online group events
- Story chapters, though not really all that interesting to me.  I usually avoid these, aside from the business ones.

Con's:
- Horrible traffic.  Not in the amount of traffic, but in distance that it spawns in.  Clearly imo, traffic is meant to purposely cause accidents and generally annoy players.
- Freeroam is annoying due to traffic.  See above.
- Drivatars have unfair grip and acceleration advantages at highly skilled and higher difficulty, motor swaps that aren't even available for the cars that they drive, and may as well be made out of concrete in all difficulties.
- Some events are unreasonably difficult, especially some story chapter events.
- Engine sounds aren't very good in Horizon 4 vs Horizon 3.
- An iffy sense of progression, better than Horizon 5 at least, but far worse the Horizon 3.
- Story chapters range from very boring to pretty decent.  
- Horrible class balance.  Some cars in the same class reach a very high top speed while others are very low; there's no sense of class balance in this game imo.
- No car meet 

So that's pretty much it.  The game is awesome in some areas and horrible in other areas imo.  Forza Horizon 3 is still the better game in comparison to both Horizon 4 and Horizon 5.  

In any case, it's worth buying during or not during a sale.",1

4758,"I got this hoping for something similar to Forza Horizon 1, that I played on the Xbox 360 a few years ago. It`s essentialy the same thing, only just worse in ALL aspects except graphics.

The soundtrack, which was pretty good in the original, with a lot of interesting songs even in genres I do not usually like, is just TERRIBLE in this one. The classical music station manages to pick a lot of really memorable songs, those from ""The most boring classical music you'll ever hear"". I mean, I love Clair de Lune, it's one of the most inspired pieces ever, except IT DOES NOT IN ANY WAY fit a racing game. Come on, even the piece from ""The Planets"" could have been better picked. All the rock songs are absolute garbage. Even the bass-heavy electronica is extremely boring.

The gameplay is just the same old arcade scripted adversaries that do impossible curves and hit you while you try to avoid them, so eventually you start to hit them on purpose to take them out.

All the cars and environment are very beautifully crafted and that's it. Not a specially fun racing game. There are a lot of better options around, for less than this one.",0

4795,"Forza Horizon is a great game, and I really liked what I played. The vehicles all handle nicely, the map is varied enough to keep you entertained, and there is quite a lot to do.

Unfortunately, It's kind of boring. 
The game showers you in fast cars and endless (absolutely endless...) praise for every little thing you do, which takes a lot of the fun out of a racing game. 
You'll generally earn a car for almost every championship you place first in, or when you complete part of any of the of task/completion lists that are in the game. I kept earning very powerful and fast cars by simply playing the game's story mode because they were locked behind EXP levels for the types of races I did. 

You also eventually just get showered in Wheelspins and Super Wheelspins, which is this game's Gacha Mechanic. About ten or so hours in I found out I had accrued ten super Wheelspins, and rolled them all. This ended up giving me millions of credits and a lot of great cars, which made it kind of pointless to go and earn anything else via racing because I could afford to make all of my cars 900 horsepower monsters and I could also afford to pump money into the hypercars the wheelspins gave me. 

If you just want to drive around and collect and customize cars more than you want to race, this game is great, and sometimes I love it for being that. 
But in the long run, I think that progression is so screwed from being a Live Service game since 2018 that it's not really worth it to play it as a real racing game in 2021 unless you unplug the internet or something.",0

Forza Horizon 4 is by no means a bad game. It's visually stunning, is genuinely fun to drive and explore in, and the actual racing feels fair and tight. Overall, an amazing single-player experience.

However, online is absolutely garbage. It's great when it works, but as soon as a guy gets into the lobby with an OG Xbox One or a PC with no SSD, you're stuck in the ""Fast travelling other players"" loading screen for up to 15 minutes EVERY SINGLE RACE (Oh I wish I was joking). Each session has 3-5 races, so to complete a session you might have to wait up to 1 HOUR doing nothing but waiting for the other guys to finish loading. For every two or three online sessions or so I get at least one ""OG Xbox/HDD"" guy ruining everyone's loading times. By the time he finishes loading, half of the lobby would've already left. It's mind-boggling how this is still an issue in such a modern game.",0
4801,"After playing FH4 for several hours on Xbox Gamepass with my T300 steering wheel I got used to the game and controls pretty well. When I heard about the release on steam I was happy to finally be able to buy and add it to my library.

Unfortunately the steam version differs from the version distributed by Microsoft. There is a center deadzone which cannot be deactivated, although the ingame settings define the inner deadzone as 0. This leads to a very unnatural feeling since high velocities only requiere slight movements wether you are driving in real life or virtually. Those slight movements are not possible because of the above said baked in center deadzone in steam's FH4.
There are more differences between the steam and Microsoft versions which you can google.

That being said if you plan on playing it with a steering wheel, don't buy it on steam. The game works perfectly fine with a wheel from the Microsoft Store or Gamepass though. Quite ridiculous!

reasons being:
pro: 
nice game 
amazing optimization
nice graphics
good physics (mostly) (if you are using mph on the counter and see that as km/h it feels quite realistic)

con: 
non skippable intro sequence
insane price
annoing talking that prevents you from playing the game and isnt skippable
you drive on the wrong side of the road (left side)

4836,"There's some serious, annoying issues that come up with this game and BitDefender and MSI Afterburner, etc.
The game is very annoying and hand-holdy with how often it interrupts what you're doing to steal control away from you and force you to look at a map about how great the next event or type of event is - it does it very often at the start; but, there's very little quite like blitzing around freely on the roads in the game's closest approximations to your dream cars and looking and experiencing stunning scenery and some pretty great computer opponents.

The ""Rewind"" feature is the feature that makes the Forza games what they are and the open-world makes the Forza Horizon games what they are, and there really isn't a better game in the ""not quite a simulation, but more realistic than regular arcade"" racing game out there for me.

4874,"- USING WHEEL & PEDALS IS POSSIBLE!!
- BIG UPDATE (Now I give 5 stars to the game)

I wrote that this game was almost impossible to play with Wheel and pedals. I was WRONG (fortunately)

- The cam inside the car showing ""hands"" is NOT realistic: 
The wheel CAN go lot furher than 45¬∫ to each side. So the way to use your wheel is NOT  taking into account the drivers hand!! You can use the HUD vision that actually shows the Wheel Rotation. THAT is the way to set it (and test driving to confirm you feel comfortable)

JUST DO THIS:

- Set Wheel rotation to about 600-700¬∫ in your device provile (I use Logitech G29 with Logitech G Hub software)

 IN THE GAME: You will have to spend a bit of time tunning the right values to use the wheel:

- In Controls select the Wheel and go to Advanced settings (pressing Space bar or the button to acces) THIS IS THE TAB YOU NEED TO ""TUNE"".
- At 1st set Force Feedback almost to zero, so you can adjust the right values to turn the wheel without confusiion with the force feedback response.
- I lowered to about ""20"" all force feedback settings
- You have to test Linearity of Wheel and Dead zone, so you can get nice control with small rotation of the wheel, and also good control with full rotation.
- Once you get it, you can increase the force feedback effects (although it will make more difficult to drive) 
----------------------------

The game is GREAT.  ""Free world"" driving is THE REASON why I purchased this game. I have many car simulators but wanted something to drive ""out of a track"", in highways, cities, etc.

HOWEVER something is VERY WRONG (NO, see the update above):

- Using Wheel & Pedals (Logitech G29 in my case):

I cannot believe nor understand how Developers didn't take more care to allow a WIDER range of Wheel rotation. It's unaceptable narrow, just about 45¬∫ Right/Left (90¬∫ in total aprox.) 

That's a BIG MISTAKE if you want REALISTIC driving!!!

If you use ""inside car"" camera, you CAN see the hands of the driver will ONLY turn that range. 
It is NOT a wheel problem, it's a game design problem (I DO HOPE they release a patch to fix this)

I spent many hours setting up the Wheel the best possible (in the game and Logitech driver profile) to get the most realism driving experience, but since the Game only turns left-right in so narrow range, it's impossible to get a realistic driving.

AT LEAST it should turn left/right 90¬∫, making it a total of 180¬∫ wheel range.

It seems the game was planned/designed for gaming pads, making it easier to control with keys. (but getting rid of any realistic driving feel) 

BUT those who use a Racing Wheel will suffer this incredible mistake. NONE of the Racing Simulator I have has so narrow turning range. The narrower is F1 2021 which simulates the real F1 cars with a 360¬∫ total range (180¬∫ left/right).

NONE of the online reviews at Youtube showed nor mentioned this awful limitation...

- SUMMARIZING: 
The game is AMAZING, with GREAT graphics, and fun events. 
""Free world"" is AMAZING, but it's a real frustration that you cannot get a ""realistic"" driving experience, ESPECIALLY CONSIDERING THE FREE WORLD CAPABILITY...

- OVERALL I still recommend this game, taking this into account. 
I never expected it, but fortunately I purchased it in a discount offer for a short period, so I don't regret.

Hope this helps to other users!! Feel free to comment and rate this ""review"".",1

4891,"My PC is more than capable of running the game, but due to reasons beyond my mortal comprehension, the game refuses to launch. It opens the splash screen, then proceeds to sit there for 2-3 minutes and does many of multiple things. From causing all my monitors to go black, seizing my PC, giving me ""Program exception"" errors that seem to never get fixed, and when one of them are, it gives me another one; I've tried everything under the sun and my ability to make this game run, from uninstalling other programs that supposedly cause issue, uninstalling or disabling Anti-Virus software and Windows Defender, Troubleshooting, everything.

Nothing seems to ever get this game past the splash screen and when it does get past it, it blacks out my monitor and disables my mouse and keyboard. I don't know what else to do, how else to fix it, or if its even my fault that it doesn't work, but I can say with utmost certainty that as much fun as this game looks; It's far more problematic and a chore to even get working if you can even get to that point without it crashing. Maybe I should've bought the Microsoft Store version... Or maybe Microsoft should learn how to make a better product that doesn't require you to jump through hoops in hopes that you MIGHT get to play the game you paid $40, $60, or even $100 for. The plethora of problems this game has for some people and the time and energy it takes to fix them far outweighs the reason to buy it. Maybe a hotfix or update might fix this game, but seeing how this is a 3-year-old game... It's absolutely ludicrous that it has any of these problems to begin with. For Christ sake, I'd honestly just rather have them make it so the Steam version sends you straight to the Microsoft Store/Game Bar (Similarly to State of Decay 2) if it meant I'd be able to at least launch, and more importantly PLAY, the product I paid for.

Update: So, the memory leak and other problems I had were solved not buy an update to the game, but a windows update. Not sure why that unfudged the entire thing but, there it is. The Steam version is still incredibly unstable, but if they can get the problems sorted, it is a very fun game.",0

Firstly, the cars feel very similar. Maybe a bit faster. Maybe a bit less grip. But ultimately the model feels like you are driving the same car. Very disappointed when I bought other cars expecting them to feel different.

Thirdly, the radio stations, not just the poor music choices, but the annoying DJs. Yes I have turned them all off now.

4936,"FIRST, FULL DISCLOSURE: I am a semi-casual racing gamer who prefers arcade to simulation. I also like a game that when you choose ""easy"" in the settings it really is easy and stays easy -- with enough of a challenge to keep things interesting. I also love to explore open worlds and be able to choose lots of different cars and just drive, drive, drive. And if the game gives lots of cash and gifts and prizes to buy and collect even more cars and upgrades, that is a real bonus to me. (By the way, I have been on Steam for years and years and have hundreds of games of all kinds. But I think this is the first time I have ever written a review for any game on Steam.)

I have enjoyed Burnout Paradise and Crew 2 and NFS: Hot Pursuit (where savegames open up access to most of the cars) BUT I have really enjoyed Forza Horizon 4! I bought the Ultimate Edition (on sale) to get started with all of the car packs and perks and expansions and I also bought a couple of the addons not found in the Ultimate Edition. I have played for over 20 hours and already have more cars and stuff than I know what to do with! It is pretty easy to level up, accumulate cash, open up the world, get more cars, etc. I have set everything to easy and I can win races and events about half the time on the very first try. So I would recommend this game for anyone who is looking for an arcade-easy casual racing experience. Oh, do I need to mention that the graphics and sound are absolutely gorgeous?! This game is FUN-FUN-FUN! The only ""problem"" with it is that there are way too many races and events and things to do in Forza 4! It will keep me busy for a very long time!

BOTTOM LINE: I recommend this recommend this game very highly -- especially for casual racing gamers!

[During installation I experienced a ""Disk Write Error"" quite a few times. I restarted Steam; restarted the computer; read the forums; googled this error message for Steam/Forza; etc. What worked for me was to just keep pushing the ""try again"" button and after 20+ error messages, the game finally installed. Forza has run without any problems other than the little install glitch and one game crash.]",1

This can be the greatest racing game I have ever played in my entire life!",1
4938,"It is definitely fun, however, for a older game at a release price, it should be flawless. I want to recommend it but all the random crashes at least every hour if not more often, make the game so frustrating to play.

If Devs fix crashing issues in the future I might change review",0
4939,"I purchased the ultimate edition on steam, as it was extremely cheap in comparison to the Microsoft Store. 
So the value for money is surely justified. 

The issues on the steam version definitely exist. 
There is a lot of random micro-stuttering, I played FH4 via the game pass from the Microsoft Store, and once you play on steam you can feel the difference.
Transitions between cinematic scenes and gameplay have different fps' so its extremely laggy during them cutscenes.

However, the developers seem to be working on it, and I hope they fix the micro-stuttering and random crashes soon.
So, I planned not to refund the game, and decided to keep it as I got all the DLC's/ Ultimate edition for dirt cheap, so good value for money I'd say.",1

The game has a chance of crashing whenever you join somebody's convoy and if it doesn't crash then, it will eventually crash within the next hour or two. So after awhile of just crashing over and over day after day it just gets tiring, because not only does it crash but certain events or game modes have long loading times and that just make's it more insufferable. This problem has been known for over a month now. You're probably better off on holding out till the next game since that is where their focus is right now.

It's an absolutely beautiful and an overall fun game to play.  Great selection of cars to choose from and enough variation to keep you busy. 

My biggest issue with the game is the constant crashing of the game itself. Disabling anti-virus or allowing permission to Forza, on your AV, seems to help but games shouldn't crash like this on such a consistent level nowadays. The devs really need to fix this issue because these are the same issues people faced when they downloaded the game at the Microsoft store. 

For this, I can't recommend you to buy this all full price. I would wait for a sale.

5070,"Ok. I KNEW this was gonna happen! I just knew...
So, there are these business missions, right? And one of them is called Isha's Taxis. All other missions that I've been have like three parts, tops. But there's that last one which is called The Big One. As an enthusiastic lover of puns, I very much enjoyed the fact that the mission has a limo. But! It also have you drive around and pick up like 5 or 6 people, I guess I've lost count. It takes like, I don't know, 20 minutes? Felt like an eternity, I'm not sure. And then... yup, there's more, the misson gives you 4 minutes limit to drive like 14 km. Which wouldn't be very much of a problem IF the game didn't close for no reason. It's not even a crash, not that there's a report or anything. And this wasn't the first time, the game just closes with no apparent reason. Or kicks you out of a lobby in the middle of a race with your friends. And the missions have no skip button. And it's not even a new game! I mean, nobody really didn't think of putting a skip button for retrying the missions for 3 god damn years? I just HAVE TO listen to the same dialogue over and over again. Because missing the 3 stars mark with less than a second is not punishment enough?

EDIT: Steam asked me to revise my review now that I've played 9 more hours. So here it is: It closed up on me 9 more times in those 9 hours. The record for the shortest amount of gameplay is 20 minutes for me. AND in those hours I've made the terrible mistake of trying the ranked system. The game has achievements that requires you to get ranked through something called Team Adventure. Which is waiting for at least 10 minutes to get to play 3 minutes online. This game is a shit show.",0

And don't come with that ""set up your wheel"" BECAUSE I CAN'T SET UP SOMETHING THAT CAN'T EVEN BE DETECTED. You choose if you want to spend your time typing a dumb comment that I'll ignore.

Spent around 2 hours on Internet trying to find a solution but it's full of people complaining about how they can't play with their wheels either so if you want to use your steering wheel to play this game, buy the one from Microsoft Store. Don't waste both your money and your time on this ridiculous version, there's no point on having this game without proper support and MS doing basically nothing about it.",0
5074,"I wish there was a neutral option here.  

The driving is loads of fun.  It's the traditional Horizon blend of sim and arcade.  Unfortunately the game wrapped around the driving is pretty awful.  The ""story"" constantly interrupts your exploring whenever you stumble across something new with narrations that can't be skipped, even when the narrator is literally just reading what's already displayed on the screen.  Everything is buried multiple menus deep, making upgrading and customizing your cars unnecessarily tedious.

It's the only game for people who wants a arcade-ish online racing game. So we're gonna have to deal with it. Servers are quite awfull aswell and it's so hard to maintain a convoy without anyone getting their acces lose to the convoy. I really do hope these issues will be fixed in FH5. Despite it's online jokes the game the feeling of driving a car in it is pretty cool alongside it's graphics. There are so much to do if you like tuning cars and specializing them.

UPDATE: mfs just released a stability update and broke the whole game..crashes every 5 mins and stutters and lags are unbearable. DO NO BUY THIS GAME UNTIL THEY RELEASE A PATCH

UPDATE 2: new update dropped and has fixed stuttering, no clue about crashes seems good let's see..",1

However, the FREEZING and CONSTANT CRASHING (game just dies out of nowhere) is PAIN IN THE BACK AREA OF THE BODY. It's devastating and I know that there are some ''fixes'' like downgrading the graphics driver and stuff, turning off Antivirus softwares or Steam Overlay and using some weird .bat files. Nothing worked. And it's REALLY SAD, because the game is FANTASTIC!

5183,"An Ordinary gamer's review:

(TL;DR, Great game. Must have for the fans of Racing games. Has issues that need fixing. Nothing game breaking. Has Ads for Paid DLCs. Not cool.)

The game itself is a 9/10. A fun offshoot than it's more serious Motorsport Counterpart. As of now I've clocked like 24 hours. And played enough to put an opinion out. First let's talk about the core mechanics. Solid. Fun. Every car feels different from another. Has more than 400 cars I believe. Beautiful graphics. Absolutely stunning. The Radio feature has unique songs to listen to while roaming around UK. Upgrading your vehicle is quite a tricky thing. Not every car drives the same. And also every higher level parts doesn't guarantee that your vehicle will perform better. It mostly depends on the Class mechanics. You can upgrade your vehicle to a specific class. if you max out your entry level car of A Class to S2 class, there's a high chance that it'll be out-classed by the other higher performance cars of the S2 Class. So be mindful about spending money on the max parts. All and all a very good experience for people who enjoyed the Forza Horizon series. Lots of races. Lots of cars. Lots of beautiful places to discover. And the best part are the 4 seasons. The whole map changes with the seasons. Well that sums up the Good.

The Bad: Micro-stuttering like crazy. Even on beast rigs that put my ROG G15 laptop to shame. But when the stuttering subsides there's lots of fun to be had.

The UgLy: Ads in a $60 game. You get ads suddenly after you load up into the world. This needs to stop. I got NBA 2K21 during the last Epic Free game thingy. But didn't install it only because of in game ads. We can let 2K slide with the ads. But not microsoft. This has to stop.",1
5184,"Ads, Ads Everywhere!
I thought this was a AAA title. Not a F2P mobile game.
Unskipable too.",0
5185,123456789,0
5186,"Completely different experience compare to NFS series. Unskippable animation videos almost takes forever to load a race while you keep spamming ESC, Space and Enter, it just doesn't work, really annoying. If you play 10hrs, probably more than an hour would pass with animation videos. Lots of animation videos, lots. It takes forever to start a race or finish an event. Lots of unskippable animations.

Steering doesnt work for the first 10 hrs, even with 35km/h you just can't steer. This is what FH team thinks progressing. Be aware do not crack you screen.

+ Extreme frame drops to 2 or 5 fps like most of the studios trying to migrate their PS games to PC. The game is not ready for PC.

My son got this game for Christmas in 2021 from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well.

The game can't even start race's with Steam and Xbox cross-play, you must all be on the same platform to race either with or against each other.

Not to mention that the cars are to expensive and there is not that much to do in the game but to drive around and grind for new cars which you can't even show off since not many people play the game anymore.

Positives: beautiful visuals, nice maps, plenty of cars and customization and great physics for an arcade-y game

As an offline experience I'd give it a thumbs up, but since multiplayer is a core element in the game and that's   not (and will not be) fixed, it's a thumbs down.

Also, they've made some changes to weekly challanges and also removed some functionalities in the last update, most probably to make people buy FH5 instead, so if you wanna get a game which will be updated, get that one",0

5262,"Great game!, but Multiplayer is a bit lacking and connections to the server are never working and keep stating poor connection even though I am on an amazing connection and my firewall is allowing and I even tried it with no firewall. Single player can give you more replay value, but not the reason I bought the game!. Not recommending until multiplayer works once again.  This is PC bought version so no game PASS or GOLD are needed to play.  Was working last year no issues, but this year online never works!  Asked support and no help at all.


PROS
1. Good Graphics, but not as good as GT
2. Good music
3. Horizon 4 always has twice the players active than Horizon 5 ever does!
4. Auction house is fun and you can get some nice stuff for cheap sometimes, but easily manipulated to trick a purchase to lag so players can't bid when they should be allowed. I don't do this, but know some that do unfortunately. It's on YT.
5. Not too hard to make money, but for the best stuff takes months.  So if you like grinds this is your thing!

CONS
1. WAY Better than 5!
2. Engine sounds a bit lacking when compared to similar level of games!
3. Controls not as good as some of the other games rated around same level of popularity. Meaning lower response rates!
4. Best played on controller, not wheel setup or keyboard.
5. Bad servers = I can never connect and stay connected to servers 100%! I am always forced to have to sign out and sign back in just to play LIVE.
6. Players learn to LAG out BIDS in AUCTION = Making it impossible to bid for the last minute and trick it into an instant purchase without buyout!
7. Players learn to LAG out BIDS in AUCTION = Making it impossible to bid for the last minute and trick it into an instant purchase without buyout!
8.  Players learn to LAG out BIDS in AUCTION = Making it impossible to bid for the last minute and trick it into an instant purchase without buyout!
9.  Players learn to LAG out BIDS in AUCTION = Making it impossible to bid for the last minute and trick it into an instant purchase without buyout!
10. Players exploiting not only the AUCTION but racing speed all the time!

 
CONCLUSION:

Love the game but just can't keep me very interested for too long before I move on to other things. Mainly due to all the exploiting going on. I know this is not Motorsport, but I always compared all Forza games and other racing games  to FORZA 2 and they mostly fail by comparison! I never had as much fun as I did in FORZA 2 on xbox360.  Those were the days I look for once again, but Forza games don't feel top 3 or even top 5 in racing games anymore and more like ranked 11 or 12th.  I will still buy a Forza game here & there but guess I am more of a iRacing and Assetto Corsa player these days and racing games that require wheel for the best experience!  Forza Horizon 4 is the best Forza I have played since FORZA 2 days, so that is not saying too much. I might even play FORZA 2 again on xbox360...I know thousands still play it!


Sirspoony rating:  3.5/10.0 = due mainly to poor connections sign IN/OUT and players tricking the AUCTION to LAGOUT possible bidding and players exploiting speed with invisible walls to make sure they never leave the track.

with multiplayer working without needing to sign IN/OUT = 4.5

AUCTION fixed and no more player manipulations allowed = 6.5

FORZA 2 rating:   9.5/10.0",0
5263,"essentially 
the story is nonexistent (making it kinda bad compared to forza 1 and forza 2, but people don't come here for that)
the game is pretty 
the online gameplay can be OK but most of the time it stinks when half the races are cross country or 'race to this point any means necessary"" which can ruin an entire match by being a tiebreaker race.
the cars sound OK, some sound great from sound recordings, but a lot of them are autogenerated and it shows (like half the hondas if not all of them lol). 
it has a fair share of everything from togues to offroad circuits, not that bad in that respect. 
I do feel as if the in-game market is TRASH, as a lot of the rarer cars are impossible to get without cheating, which might get you banned.
Moderation is also pretty bad here, half the scoreboards are just filled with cheaters, a lot of lobbies too. It's an old game; what are you gonna do about it. 

overall 7/10 ign, the game is pretty and fun but it lacks good sound design and a good moderation team, as well as a good community communication with microsoft is bad. Just buy forza horzion 5 though, this game isn't updated anymore and it's probably gonna be terrible in the next 6 months or so.",0

I can't accept voice communication / invites from ANYONE if I simply don't want to hear excessively loud open-mic noise (it's not like any of them ever talk)
Also it's really stupid that you can-not start matchmaking for races- only pray that the 40-50 people in your session both see, and decide to accept a hard-to-notice notification on their screen.",0
5271,"It has to be said now and quickly before any of the people who weren't around when the arcade racing scene was at an all time high in the 00's come to bite me.

So many different and wild takes on what it means to achieve speed in a four wheeled missile. Split Second, Blur, Need For Speed: Hot Pursuit, Motorstorm, Burnout Paradise, Test Drive Unlimited. All of these seemingly disappearing over night, almost like people's general interest for car culture in the 10's came and swiped all of the fantastical joyride video games away with it. Arcade racing was brimming at the seems with potential ideas but is now simply non-existent in today's video games. 

I say this because the Forza Horizon franchise seems to hinge desperately to this fact. I can't say it any other way. Horizon 4 is a very over-rated game in an empty market that seems to distance itself from racing games in general, masked in the obscurity of it's old rooted genre. thus giving it leverage with younger audiences. A familiar feel of loose steering and loud engine noises, the freedom to go anywhere, do anything will sound tantalising to any new video gamer. But when put in a broader perspective, it is anything but that.  'There is nothing quite like it' that's because nobody makes these types of games anymore, It's as straight forward as that - but I don't want to stop there.

This game could have been better, it could have less moronic dialogue and less pedestrian-esque friendliness hammering you over the head all of the time 'Well done! you're so great! didn't I mention you're fantastic?', and maybe they could've toned down the unskippable DLC ad's for the very video game you're trying to play (f... seriously?). Turning the wheel feels like an ice rink. Just the odd sensation of disconnect I feel when driving puts me off, between the road and the wheels that feel like they float just above the surface. I just can't express it further than that.

Drivatars range from borderline brain dead to blatant cheating, as much as deliberately slowing down to help you win by the end of races (seriously look it up). The game simply pausing itself in multiple ways to tell you something constantly, bringing you out of your zone. The UI is atrocious, bloating itself with tabs filled with DLC, strategically placed so that you have to pass through it every time you need to edit or change car, or even do the simplest of tasks. It's engineered in a really scummy way to suck more cash from your wallet. It's a horrible feeling. An open world game that touts freedom of expression and ease of access offers probably the worst character customisation system I think I've seen in an open world. Bombarding you with a slot machine themed prize system that rewards cars you never wanted in the first place and clothes that almost never resemble what you wish to wear. Honestly just give me the ability to reach for anything I want If you're preaching about freedom so much. It's a shallow and flat experience across the board but it isn't the worst experience ever, there is some joy to be had here despite it being short-lived. I'm just really shocked that this is apparently the 'gold standard' of racing games. The consensus surrounding this title really does boggle the mind... Because this game could be so much better at doing the things that it wants you to do, it just can't seem to get out of it's own way and let you just.... drive.

5335,very scary,1
5336,Why is the tutorial so fucking long??? i just wanna drift brahhh!!!,0
5337,"Great game, but with some flaws.

Pros:

- Car collection is impressive. It has everything a car enthusiast might want as well as moderate customization that gives you an opportunity to make your car behave the way you want. So it's no problem finding your dad's old audi to slam it, swap the engine and put a wang on in to launch the car over the fence of your neighbor's private property.
- The game wants to flood your garage with cars giving you a new one as a reward for almost every your activity in the game. Be ready to spend substantial time checking every one of them.
- The map is not that big compared to the —Å–≥–µ—à for example, but it has dynamic seasons and weather. It doesn't annoy (me at least) cuz it changes. It's a variety. What else do you need?
And thankfully everything matches the location. Cuz snowing in Miami like in the game mentioned above is ridiculous.



Cons:

- Its multiplayer is harder to fix than the —Å–≥–µ—à one. And ofc it doesn't work outta the box. Intensive brainf-_- is obligatory. Otherwise, you don't get full experience of the game.
- Unstoppable Kieras, Joels and whoever that might be make you wanna press alt+f4 after you open a map to hear a minute or two of absolutely useless crap that no one asked for.
-  Menus are just weird and unreasonably complicated. If you don't know where to find what you want it may take you some time browsing through endless tabs and pages inside pages in order to fulfill a simple task.

Conclusion:

Is it worth your time? Yes. It provides you with a great car game experience. One of the best car games in my opinion. It's especially worth checking out if you're obsessed with cars.
The problems are manageable and not significant. So it's not a game changer.
I would recommend this game for sure. Giving it's discounted price it's a must have. (+ultimate edition give you a hundred of cars)",1

If you already own the game, and you are having issues, uninstall ASUS GameFirst (if you have it). This software breaks the network protocol Teredo which is required for Forza.

For the achievement hunters:
Currently, (July 2022) you aren't able to get the ""Encore"" achievement. It is bugged, the developer is well aware of this fact and as far as I know, they will not fix this.",0
5344,"Great game, loved it on Philly's xbox store, decided to buy it on steam just for convinience's sake. And what a shitshow... The Spectacle begining of the game straight up ruined, because brakes and gas pedals were switched. And force feedback was reversed, well that's not a problem, quick settings check-up and everything is fine. EXCEPT it's realy not... the game just ignores the Clutch pedal on Logitech g27. I've tried everything, and I'm not alone - this problem has percisted for more than 8 months wihtout any repsonce from the dev. And is still happening today. That's just pathetic quite frankly, since microsoft store version works flawlesly from the start. That's a refund for me.  
Long story short - if you have g27(one of the most popular wheels out there, mind you) Stay Away.",0

I bought the deluxe version and the game gives you VIP access and fast XP to get ahead so you can get a few cars quickly. Each car is fun to drive. Offroad ones are my favourite.

After hundreds of hours played of car games, I can certainly say that this car game is without a doubt the best I have ever played, with perfect arcade gameplay, phenomenal graphics and a breathtaking soundtrack for each race.
The game is so diverse, playing on land, tar, snow, sand, day and night.

Everything in this game makes sense, the car buying and selling system is also very well executed, the demand for abandoned cars is worth it.

There's not much to say, rather then that this game is breathtaking.

Also, if you're on a wheel, good luck setting that up, as this version doesn't really have a proper support for it. At least at the end of the day you can always receive a refund without problems.",0

Waste of money, don't buy on steam.Also you can't transfer your progress from your Microsoft or Xbox account, which also adds to the dreadful experience.If you are new to the game and only want to play singeplayer it might be fine for you tho, but, even then, the game is extremely overpriced considering it game out 3 years ago.",0

5435,"I have played this game on a different platform, so my time here isn't accurately reflected. I would give this game a neutral rating if I could. It's probably the best overall racing game on Steam at the moment, but that's more because of a lack of choice than anything. Positives would be the map, scenery, and graphics. A lot of negatives though. The game is still not very stable. It's better than before but still crashes often. You can read the reviews about this in the M$ store. Car selection is mediocre, especially considering a lot of cars are locked behind events or online. This brings me into another huge downside: they love to try to steer you into playing online. That's cool for people that want to, but it's annoying otherwise. Auction house is another weak point. It's straddled by latency issues. Another negative is the unskippable cringy VA scenes. Chris Harris' YT channel was good, but as a TG presenter he falls super flat. This is exasperated with his performance here as the script is super fake and terrible. I would only recommend buying this on sale and don't get fleeced on the DLCs. Not sure the ultimate edition is worth it either. Also the most brief description of PvP: Rammers.

Steam will not refund me because I went over the 2hr return time limit trying over and over different ways to get the game to work correctly. The Steam Version doesn't work, what part of that don't they understand. $100 thrown away, because Steam is ok with selling a product advertised to work with my set up, when it doesn't. If you go to Forza, after the fact, you will see they are having Issue with my set-up. Something that should be highlighted on Steams, web store, which if it is, i did not see it. I always check to see which wheels work when buying this type of game. The Microsoft version, works flawlessly! So, I paid twice as much for the game to work! Don't make the same mistake. Just stating Facts, as to my experience, Fanatec V 2.5 CSL would NOT work for me correctly with the Steam Ultimate version. I recommend the Microsoft Ultimate version highly, if using my set up.

5465,"Singleplayer score: 5/10

As a first time player of the Forza game, I could sum up it as a fun game. But not great, if you want to pursue only a singleplayer experience. The main problem is HOW MUCH STUFF is thrown into your face, so it gets overwhelming...

Pros:
 - stunning graphics of cars and nature;
 - lovely landscape & cities of Scotland;
 - a lot of cars & events;
 - season changing is a really nice concept, but sometimes I don't understand when the season change should happen;

Cons:
 - no story at all, this game is very focused on a multiplayer;
 - a lot of different events, modding, tuning, customization of clothing, honks, online store, dances, and etc... it is a bit overwhelming. Just too much stuff thrown in your face;
 - buying homes in the game make no sense... in TDU/TDU2 it was much better executed;
 - some events are repetitive, so it gets boring;
 - unskippable ads (some LEGO addon for example), a lot of advertisement in a game;
 - unskippable audio;
 
It is a good racing game, especially if you want just relax after a working day. But not great if you want more singleplayer experience. I think it is more focused on a younger audience, which is fine. But I enjoyed TDU2 more, I wish they released newer version of it...",0

5512,"After a first couple of sessions, I write my current opinion: good looking graphics, childish gameplay, little realism, a waste of money for me.
It is as good as the 1970s ""Pole Position"" arcade game in what comes to handling and credibility: just crash and proceed, no harm done, even with all the ""simulation"" settings switched on. If you want an approximate ""feel"" of what the driving experience would be, then you'd better stay light-years distant from this title. There really is no connection between what you see and the physical sensations that could come from a proper force-feedback steering wheel configuration. What a waste.
If you only want to have fun having collisions, jumps, and sorts of Mario Kart moments, then the game is pretty, but I am hugely disappointed with its lack of realism and also with most of the gaming sites and magazines that have reviewed it, which seem to be only worried with pleasing the publishers - Microsoft in this case - and don't emphasize weaknesses enough.
Forza Horizon 4's weaknesses are blatantly explicitly: this plays as a 6-years old kid plays with its toy cars. Bah, much better to go watch Noddy in Toyland.

However,  the cars just handle like crap. I get that Forza has supposedly turned into more of an arcade-ish racer these days, but it's worse than I thought. I've driven a lot of vehicles in my time, and I consider myself a racing enthusiast. I have a logitech G27 racing wheel and pedal set, and have played MANY racing games over the last 30+ years. I figured I'd get this game and play it with a controller for a simple pick up and play racing game like NFS.

The vehicle physics in this game are very unrealistic. Vehicles that should handle like boats, instead handle like modern sports cars. Then you have some seriously legendary vehicles that should handle as though they are on rails, instead understeering at 40 mph.

I refunded the game as soon as I felt like I was fighting unrealistic physics, more than having fun racing. It's a shame as the rest of the game is well polished.",0

5554,"Although the price tag is insane and the DLC paywall sucks a**, Forza has to be one of the greatest racing titles of all time. Ive waited years for Forza Horizon to come on steam. When I got the news I was ecstatic.

Story - There really is none. I play this game to race and goof around with cars along with friends.

Multiplayer - base of the game

DLC - The DLC for this game is doo doo. Never in my life have I thought ""hmm yes, I want to pay 3 dollars for a few cars"". Compared to Forza Horizon 3's DLC, Forza Horizon 4's DLC is absolute trash.

Graphics - I honestly prefer 3s color scheme over 4s. They both look the same but in different settings

Complaints - I dislike the DLC that this game has, I hate the $60 price, I hate that there is a premium pass for f**king cars, I hate how players cant transfer progress over, and I hate how Forza Horizon 3 did better than Horizon's 4th gen. 

I give this a 7.5/10, couldn't beat Horizon 3 but at least it isn't Horizon 1.",1

Sadly, the Steam version features stuttering issues during cutscenes and race intros/outros that completely break the flow of the game. The Windows Store version does not have these issues.

For comparison: Windows Store version with a GTX 960=no stuttering ever. Steam version with an RTX 3070=stuttering during cutscenes and race intros/outros. Unacceptable. Microsoft, please fix this so I, and many others, can change our negative reviews to positive ones.",0

The game runs perfectly fine on my computer with no jiterring and all that. Downside of not being able to transfer your progress might be 1, but generally speaking the game is very well put together.

I Definitely recommends Forza Horizon 4 for those who likes an open world racing games that can be played casually but still feels like a top tier simulation games.

5620,"I have been waiting a long time for this game to release on Steam, finally it released today and played it for the first time, it was totally worth buying it. The amount of cars available is huge and the customization is good (not as good as nfs heat but good).
Taking about performance, I stay above 100fps everything set on ultra settings on 1080p with a rx580 and a ryzen 5 1400, so the optimization for this game is amazing.
The only negative thing I see is the price, I would say it's too much for a 3 year old game, so maybe look for it when it's on a discount unless you have been waiting for a long time to play it.",1

Stutters more then a kid in middle-school trying to get the nerve to talk to his crush.
And last but not least, turns out the version on the Microsoft store has more stability and will gladly accept weirdo controllers if you're trying to play with a wheel and handbrake like I am because I'm a wannabe Ken Block and NOTHING I've tried has allowed me to use my handbrake or assign it to the E-brake but I guess if you get this version off of the MSS it works just fine and runs better? How in the blue hell does that work? Did Steam get a different version?",0
5629,Can't even launch the game. I've gone through all the troubleshooting I could and there doesn't seem to be any reliable way to fix this that I've come across online. Gifted a copy to my cousin and works just fine for him but nothing on my end (10850k/1080ti) A real shame as I was looking forward to finally playing this. Will keep my eye on this to see if it ever gets resolved but for now I've requested a refund.,0

5652,"Firstly, the gameplay and graphics are outstanding and breathtaking.  Want to street race? Yes. Want to Drift?? Yes. Want to rally??! Yes. Want to offroad??!! Yes. Almost anything driving sport related, it's got it.  It took me a while to get the Logitech G923 wheel to calibrate correctly, but guides helped alleviate that.  If you're a racing game nut, this will do it. The rearview mirror and side mirrors even work if your GPU can handle it... goodbye 1990s-2000s racing games!

Secondly, and most primarily for me, the game crashes/freezes after about an hour of gameplay... always.  I don't know why, and no amount of diagnosing/troubleshooting and reading guides have helped.  It's killing it for me, because there's so much potential for me to enjoy the game.  I'm almost certain my system shouldn't be having issues in the first place either.

5657,"Error fixed, game is still bad. By playing the game for 2 hours you receive already a supercar, that's way to fast. All DLC's you will buy you get the cars for nothing which kills my will to play, as it's way to easy(and sometimes to cheap) to get new cars and tune them.

On the racetrack, opponents are glued to the road. No chance to push them away, on the other hand the opponents can do that with you. (2012 called me and they want their physics back)

The races are boring and adapt to the performance level of your vehicle. It would have been nicer to have class races that have a performance limit.

the races are all very short and alot of the custom races seem to be geared towards fast progression rather than challenging content.
It runs pretty well , im on maxed settings with a 1080 and i get solid frames.
ive only had a few un skipable  adverts in he first 15 hours of so. it was a bit annoying but they only last 10 sec or so , not a huge issue .
the UI is very over the top and working out what all the different races/challenges/seasonal targets etc are can be difficult. ive pretty much ignored this aspect so far and just raced cars.
my only real complaint is how everything seems to need to be shared/uploaded to the cloud. everything for custom colour schemes to car tuning's all seem to have no apparent option for private and the ui for these aspects is very click heavy and slow.

5710,"The best casual racing game i've ever play

Forza Horizon 4 is a open world racing game with simcade handling. Simcade mean the handling mimic real cars enough but it can't get too wild and its awesome, you feel like driving a real car but it still fun even if you meesed up.

This game has plethora of car choice, many of them are a legend cars, even better this game is not grindy at all if you want to collect many cars. Most of the cars can be bought after finishing 3-6 races and many times you got the cars for free.

Tuning & upgrade is fun to do since you always notice the differences when you drive it, you can build the cars, tune it to became more powerful, you can even swap the engine, give different drivetrain layout, make it dragster, make it drift car, make it rally car. Tune it too much your car would be difficult to handle, you never obliged to upgrade it to the max like arcade games.

The progression system is pretty simple and diverse, separated from multiple diciplines. Theere is a tons of activity, but the game have a great job to offer you these activities few by few so you never feel overwhelmed yet you always feel you progressing.

The graphics is nice and very optimized, 50-60fps dynamic high with gtx 1050 4gb (The HDD can barely keep up tho). The photo mode using different rendering so it looks nicer than gameplay.

Now for the map, it's okay almost meh. Looks beautiful at first, but it's get boring fast, not much variation on the environment. The choice of edinbourgh for urban make it more boring and the urban area is very small. Road variation is okay but not really fun, thankfully the fortune island fixes that.

The customization is lacking on cosmetic sides, not many car you can change its bodykit, even for cars that have bodykit option, it only 1 or 2 bodykits also there is only 1 generic spoiler. other than that, livery and rims, thats it. It still faar from NFS level of cosmetics.

Despite some shortcomings, Forza Horizon 4 is a must have games for car enthusiast who looking for fun game that doesn't need tons of commitment or tons of hours just to learn it. Just open, buy, build, and drive, anytime",1

Graphics and sound design are also just above average, don't expect 'a wow factor' at those areas.

Game Completion: ‚úÖ

(My Input: Aside from the fact that the game (even after a few years since it's release) is still the same price, I couldn't say it enough how much I enjoy this game. The variety of cars, to in-depth game mechanics still amuses me. The game graphically looks astonishing. Unfortunately with this games release to steam, previous progression made on other platforms isn't available for transfer... even because of this, this doesn't change the way I see FH4. I still consider this game one of my most enjoyed modern aged racing game. 

This is why I decided to repurchase this game too. Personally I don't like the Microsoft store (and I also prefer keeping majority of my games on steam anyways).

Thank you for your time, and I'm glad this game has finally made its arrival to Steam)",1

5916,"THIS GAME MAY EVEN BE BETTER THAN ANY OTHER RACING GAME IF HAVE EVER PLAYED, I RECOMMEND IT!!",1
5917,"I would recommend this game, as both the visual and mechanical polish of the game set it at a tier well above the other inane dregs that AAA companies churn out for pennies on the dollar so they can go out and recklessly indulge to only the economy's benefit on a menagerie of goods and services known as sex workers and hard drugs. That said, I cannot in its current state recommend this title for a few reasons.

1) The awful net code on this online makes for a buggy mess of dubstepping cars that opt on whether or not they are truly shuffling every day based on your proximity alone. If not for the ai quite literally being the Taken from Destiny all over the track, the online community ensures that you will never want multiplayer again. People are insufferable and meme culture has ruined the planet for everyone but indigenous peoples in third world countries.

2) The mechanical tuning of a racing games is thus: Will there be AI? If yes, include varied difficulties that artificially increase the challenge by an almost RNG assisted percentage of how accurately they will follow the drive line. Is that too hard? If yes or no, give the AI GTA5 police scanners that can rubber band them through space and time to draft you; even if only for a limited distance determined by nothing.

3) ADS! A premium title, with DLC, that shoves a sinful glut of bullshit ads for the game's content down your gullet at a rate more invasive than Arma 3. It makes one feel as if Ready Player One actually did anything right in its predictions for the gaming future. I have never, and will never, give a single ounce of care to the Lego DLC if only because I was sat in a chair and forced awareness upon a la Clockwork Orange.

4) Perhaps only the one 1 actual sin that is beyond the scope of nitpicking and bleating, it is 2021 and the 2018 working title features an online experience that is rife with dropped sessions, infinite loading screens, dropping lobbies, and of course crashes on anything other than a 2002 netbook that the annoying neighbor who won't stop playing wall ball on the fucking building's mom bought him to play Fortnite. 3 years this game has been in release, and it is still a pile for multiplayer the majority of the time when it even comes to just *running as intended*.

The game is bad, and anyone that condones it are liars and cheats unto themselves. They got my money, and I feel horrible about it. If protesting would mean something, I'd head to Leamington Spa and throw animal blood on the staff.",0

Game-play 9.7 - more races in all Category's would be nice. It would be nice to have a lot of races utilizing all the streets/roads of the game. redoing races just to level up the Category's is not good for a game like this. it gets to be a grind and tedious at times. and it's hard some time to find player willing to Co-Op with cause there playing with friends all ready. all and all a great game. even is I had to start over, it's FUN!

I have done the majority of the missions in the game with few crashes and little stutter. I will just have to level all areas of my play through and then do some multiplayer Achievements. The game has Some quirkiness but only if you have to much stuff running in the back ground.

The race im talking about is called 'Tarn Hows Scramble' when the game first transitions to autumn.

6035,"This game has beautiful scenery.
At first when I started playing it the first 3 hours I was puzzled what I was supposed to do. I was puzzled about what the objectives of the game were.  But, I googled a chat site and asked questions on google search bar about questions I had about the game, and, that helped a lot.

Basically, you go to the map, and on the map are different opportunities to pursue. And, using the direction buttons on my xbox type controller, I move the map cursor to the next objective or race that I want to indulge in. Then I press the A button and a route is made from where my car is on the map to the objective.

Then, I leave the map by pressing a very small button on my controller. Then I go back to the 3-d world where my car is.  When I look on the street, I see blue arrows, and I drive, following the blue arrows to the race I want to go to. 

Then, when I arrive there, I press the X button and the scenery around me changes and a group of 12 cars are in a race and we all race to see how many points we can get.  Then when I finish with the challenge, a screen opens up and shows me how many points I got.

Don't worry, when you shut off the game a warning message shows ""Are you sure you want to quit, you will loose all your progress.  I don't know why they put that message in the game because it's not 1. You always keep you progress, and when you play the game the next day or whatever, you will see you have all your progress saved.

I have other driving game of the 'need 4 speed' editions, but this Forza 4 rocks them all. It is a nice clean beautiful game and you should get it. I got the $98 dollar one because it has extra cars etc.

I'm sure it would have been an amazing game and ive heard endless good things about it  but out of my 2.2hrs in game i think maybe 10 minutes was actual game play and the rest was the game crashing over an over and over and over again. Ive tried every recommendation ive found online and in discussion groups to fix it and nothing has worked. I completely erased the game from my pc and reinstalled it and that didnt work either.

6054,"Do not buy this game. It looks like a coin flip whether or not your computer will like the game or not. For me, and a bunch of other customers mind you, the game crashes very often. The game looks great, the driving mechanics are superb, and the feeling of racing and speeding down a roadway is very immersive (more so if you got a wheel, shifter, and pedals). And the online is cool, not the best though. Waiting for a game takes a long time, and if you host your own race, I've only ever gotten one other guy to race against me. And Forzathon is probably my favorite online activity that this game possesses. I reeeeally want to play this game for an hour or 2 straight. And since I own a driving setup, immersion is what *drives* (see what I did there) the experience. Every time it crashes it breaks immersion. I didnt spend $60 to play this game with a keyboard or even a controller. Steam should honestly give me a refund if I can (and I definitely have can) prove the game is defective. But I am in it for the long haul apparently, so c'mon Playground Games. Do your job and fix your game. Or did I spend $60 for a defective product? (Clarification, yes I did)

EDIT 10/10/22 Okay, so after searching up some fixes for a few months, people said that my GPU, previously a 1660 Ti was throttling the game and causing the crash. I forgot about Forza, and finally bought a 3080 in June. Downloaded Forza 4 again to give it a try, I mean hey, it's gotta work right? Wrong, it still crashes. Bad game. Don't buy, please.",0

[h1] The Need For Speed game I needed [/h1]

I am a NFS Most Wanted 2005 fan just like everybody else. But I cannot like any race games except mw2005. Finally I got something to play. FH4 is not better but good enough to keep me going. NFS Heat was cringe fest with disgusting forced songs. Also NFS Heat's rubberbanding was so obviously horrifying that makes any intelligent creature puke. FH4 is a lot more calming, has better atmosphere with radios that you choose to listen and difficulty setting to make this game suitable for both casual and the tryhard player. 

(Plus EU cars, Cars that I get to see in my region. That's kinda personal positive side of the game.)

Pros:

+ Lots of cars
+ Great music*
+ Good regional pricing (at least for my region 20$ for ultimate)
+ Adjustable meaningful difficulty settings.
+ Awesome cockpit view. I wish It had VR too. (and I wish I had a VR set with a wheel)
+ Season changes. Winter is great for skiing
+ Detailed tuning settings
+ Lots of content (varied racing types)
+ Customization even though it's minimal (I get to make NFS MW 2005 iconic car with BMW M5*)
+ No catch-up mechanic
+ Drafting and slingshot mechanics are done well
+ Toggleable Re-wind.

Cons:

- No sale at launch with 70$ price tag for a 3 year old game. (Without reginal pricing I wouldn't buy this game at all.)
- Forced season changes. Seasons are cool but let me please roam in whatever season I like the most.
- Billboard hunting for free fast travel. Boring grind and unbearable without it.
- Customization should be more detailed and a little easier.

*My personal favourite song: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd1GDyHiICU


Overall, It's a must for every racing fan. I found it much more fun than NFS Heat. I definetly recommend this game.

The only thing that can be blamed on the project at the moment is the luggage from the previous parts that lingers behind.

[EDIT 2.0: After the new early May 2021 update my game still crashes after loading into the game. So I went to go look for the 'userdata' folder and manually removed all of my 'Saved Game' files and voila it's working again, but now I lost 30 hours of gameplay. Put the files back and the crashes roll in.] Also after restarting my new career about 5 hours in it's crashing again in the first loading screen.

Forza Horizon 4, a gem for sure but it does have some blemishes:

- Micro-stuttering, crashing, no save game transfer from Xbox App and some steam achievements don't unlock after achieving them. I have over 300 Hours in this game via the game pass. What a shame.

- Corrupted my save game files. If you like the risk of starting over after dodgy updates then you're looking at the best game for that.

[Edit 3.0] After about a year of leaving the game alone and on acquisition of a GPU with 4GB of video memory I am able to enjoy this game again. No corruption of save game files thus far, less micro-stuttering and an overall nice experience. I had some trouble with the Xbox app [which is necessary if you want to play FH4 online] but after a re-install of the Xbox App via the Website [not Microsoft Store - it doesn't work via that] I was able to connect the game again after Signing Out and Signing back into my Xbox Account via the FH4 Start Menu before loading the game. Still no save game sync from Xbox App but seems to sync progress via Steam Cloud just fine. Still crashes occasionally when entering houses which is annoying.

+ But if you can get past all of the negatives this game is probably one of the best racing games I've ever played, and I've played many since I started playing racing games back in 1999.

+ Loads of content! Like, really this game will keep you busy for months.

+ Can be played comfortably solo but I highly recommend doing all of the online adventures, especially ranked, because you'll be gifted a ton of stuff once the season is over!

+ The rewards system and game pacing is excellent, I don't get bored easily with this game (except if I need to delete my save game files due to updates corrupting my profile)

+ So many cool cars and childhood faves including [SPOILER ALERT!!!!!] go see for yourself :) over 700 cars!!

+ If you have the hardware, this game looks GORGEOUS!!

+ Can be played comfortably with a computer keyboard

+ Multiplayer with friends is a lot of fun

+ Sounds are pretty good but not the best (GRID & DIRT still rule here), love the soundtrack but it can become pretty repetitive. (Especially when re-doing your career because of corrupted save games)

+ Large maps and cool expansion packs.

[Overall] Despite some annoying bugs, it seems like a lot of them are ironed out - this game is absolutely fantastic. I love cars and to be able to drive a bunch of legendary cars and upgrade them beyond recognition is a real treat. The career mode is brilliant and entertaining, the online challenges are tough but fun and very rewarding. What are you still here for? Go buy the game and see for your self!",1

Okay now to the serious part.
Firstly, i own Forza Horizon 3 Ultimate on the Windows Store and have spent at least 150 hours on it, i won lot of events, finished lot of things and got bored of it.
Later after Forza Horizon 4 was out, i tried it but didn't purchase it, it pretty much is the same as Forza Horizon 3 but new map and has Hot Wheels plus the LEGO expansion which are enjoyable.
Optimization is good, i could run Forza Horizon 3 4k everything on highest without even setting performance to highest and it could run at 60fps at all time, Forza Horizon 4 can run 4k everything at highest but MSAA at x2 for 55 fps so i do have to lower one setting here, playing on an 1080ti.
Main and DLCs maps could be bigger, they're a bit small so it gets a bit repetitive pretty fast.
Free view from cockpit view could be better (just like in Project Cars 3) but other than that, the interiors are well made.

This one is also good but there are a few problems with it.

Firstly, the price they're asking for is way too much, i paid 60$ plus taxes so about 70$ for this one game.
The worst is that the ""ultimate edition"" doesn't even come with everything, in fact, it lacks the Hot Wheel car pack, like what the hell Microsoft / Playground Games? 
Games cannot be worth more than 50$ and perhaps it was worth that much at its release but it's been a few years it's been released and we're only a few months away from Forza Horizon 5.
Depending on where you live, it can cost a lot less, go for it if that's the case.
If you own Forza Horizon 3 and want this, i don't really see the point except for the LEGO dlc and more cars but even so, is it really worth that much money? That's definitely a no.
Is it a great game nonetheless? Of course. 
But i definitely won't purchase another Forza Horizon game at this price again.
You're still better off paying 70$ for this than for any The Crew games.
 

Works well with my (Logitech G910) keyboard, my (Xbox 360 Chrome limited edition) controller and my (Logitech G27) wheel.

I hope that they will bring Motorsport 7 on Steam and for a cheaper price but i doubt that this will happen, and Motorsport 8 will certainly be overpriced as hell.
Open world is cool and all but tracks based game such as the Motorsport series is great too.

As i have always say, i'm probably the only one who wants this but having some kind of police / chases in Forza Horizon would be great, it doesn't have to be all serious, it doesn't even has to be real police, just something that would be considered part of the festival.

8.5/10 - Game itself.

6144,"It's a nice game, good graphics, good physics, good systems.
BUT :
IF you want to pull your hair out in frustration because of the ""AI"" NPC racers (named ""drivatars""), buy it and lose all your hair.

NPC NASA rocket launch starts :
Physics do not apply to the NPC racers, at the start some of the cars behind will have rocket boosters attached to their cars and blast past your Agera RS in a freaking Porsche Macan with a 40-50 kmh difference in the first 3-5 seconds.
NPC cornering :
Very inconsistent, and as mentioned, they do not adhere to physics. Try to follow their cornering speed ? Nope.  Sometimes they have bubblegum tyres that just sticks and turns and fly past but sometimes they become normal. 
Seen a Zonda R turning a corner while tyres screaching but still gets shoved to the roadside by a Land Rover blasting past with a higher cornering speed ? Come to FH4 and experience it !
NPC Super Teamwork :
NPCs in your immediate vicinity will just keep doing brake checks and ram you off the road like you are just a balloon, while the few NPCs far out front fly off into the horizon. Their catch up system are so great that a racer can come from behind 50kmh faster, move into your racing line and shove his butt with glowing brake lights into your face.

6166,"Forza is on steam finally.. Yeayy. 
Alright apart from the excitement. Let me start from the ""Bad"", there's ""Good"" too so wait up

Right so the first, being very nit picky but i tried Forza first time with a friends Xbox controller on my PC when i was using GamePass, and instantly ended up orgasming by the ""Brake"" vibration feedback"" on the controller. 

Now a lot of people who never played with a Xbox controller on MS store might not know this, but when you hit the brakes on the car, there's a veerrryyy orgasmic grinding vibration on Xbox controller exactly like a disk brake grind. 
That feature was the sole reason i purchased my special edition Xbox controller for Forza. Sadly though that same feedback is not available here on steam. .Probably a Microsoft exclusive setting, So there's no Brake grinding feedback, it's basic like any other racing game. 
On the Good note though somehow the Bumps vibration feedback have increased a bit so that feels solid. 

Now the Progress. .Sadly it didn't carry over here to steam. Or maybe i missed some step IDK maybe i was playing using GamePass on MS all along so that's why?? Weirdly though Sponsor and earning messages are all still available in my InGame notification but not the actual progress. Now on the VERRYY Good note again. This game costed me LESS THAN HALF of MS store. 
Ultimate edition on MS Store  is $99.99!!!!!
I purchased it for like 35$(India Region) ON STEAM the same Ultimate Edition!!!. THAT's CHEAPER THAN THE BASE VERSION OF MS STORE!! 
So even though my old progress is gone, I ended up getting so many cars at the starting only with the car Pass/Packs and VIP bundle that now i can cover up the lost progress easily, Won't have to grind much so win win and i finally own the game fully. :D 

Some tech notes. 
If someone is using Creative soundblaster AE-5 plus or any other sound card and was having Sound cracking or noise issue. That has been solved in this steam version. Which i wasn't able to fix on MS version and ended up uninstalling Forza after when i got a new Creative sound card.
There'll be some minor jitters or lags for a few moments while playing first time. After next start all got fixed. Working all smooth on Ultra setting on my 1060 6GB and i7 8086k getting around 80-120 FPS.

Right enough time wasted here. back to playing. :P",1

6203,"I bought the game because it looks like fun. I was hoping to find a replacement or alternative to the open world game ""Test Drive Unlimited 2"" for visiting grandchildren. I have decades long experience with driving games of all types from ""Grand Prix Legends"", ""Need for Speed"", ""Race"", ""Dirt xx"", ""Assetto Corso"" to ""iRacing"" to name a few. I cannot remember ever having to give up on a game because I could not configure the controls. Forza Horizon 4 is the first! 

The configuration for controls is broken - for me. It may work perfectly for many with standard setups. On the surface it has presets for many wheel and pedal sets. I cannot say whether they work or not. All I can say is I could not define my wheels and pedals. I have a Thrustmaster T500RS wheel (for which there is a predefined setup) but I have had to change my pedals to Thrustmaster T-LCM Pro pedals. These are not attached to the wheel but have their own USB lead. I am able to configure the wheel and pedals with all other driving games that I have.

If I start with the predefined Thrustmaster T500RS control profile and try to customize the controls for the pedals it will not recognize when I press the pedals. The same if I try to define a custom control profile.  

I created a support case and got some friendly but not helpful replies. I sent them information and diagnostics files. There are some imputmappingprofile files for defining controls but I was not able to get any help with how I might create a custom file and get it recognized or alter an existing one. I was told they were working on a solution and to be patient. But they closed the case and said when a solution was available they would ""inform the community"". They didn't say how, but if it is supposed to help me they should inform me via the support case. How am I supposed to know when or where the information is being published to the ""the community""? 

As I say I have never experienced before a driving game where it was not possible to define the controls for steering an pedals. Normally you just click on say Accelerate and then press the button or pedal that you wish to use for that. All controllers currently recognized by Windows as game controllers should be available.

I realize my setup is not very standard. But the wheel and pedals are both normal Thrustmaster products. What I react most to is that the configuration screens themselves do not appear to function correctly or as intended as regards pre-defined or custom profiles. Therefore I cannot recommend the game, and I advise people to make sure they are able to configure and play the game withing the 14 days and 2 hours of ""gameplay"" they are allowed before getting a refund. I spent one and a half hours inside the game trying to configure the controls and many hours outside the game looking for files and documentation and communicating with support.",0

Using Thrustmaster T300 with Thrustmaster Shifter and Handbrake, literally nothing works. Probably the worst feeling Force Feedback i've felt in any racing game and my Shifter and Handbrake isn't detected at all by the game.
After roughly an hour of googling the only fix i've found includes third party software and .ini file editing. Got half-way into the process before i decided it isn't worth the hassle.

Negatives
1. Can't access a decent amount of vehicles unless you pay for DLC.
2. A lot of vehicles don't sell well.
3. Challenges are in need of a tune up so to speak.
4. Scenery is not what I would call photo worthy and pictures look just okay with vehicles in them. (Opinion)
5. Using the xbox app on PC is not something I want to do or like and there is no playing with friends or online without being logged into it.
6. Buying a house in game is pretty much a visual waste of in game currency.

Positives:
1. There are lots of cars in base game.
2. It is easy to get more vehicles and wheel spins are a great way to gain more cosmetics for you in-game character and new vehicles.
3. Wheels spins can also land you a FORZA EDITION vehicle.
4. Graphics are good, and driving the map and exploring alone is fun.
5. DLC is not too expensive and you do get a decent amount for what you pay.
6. You can design your vehicles yourself and there are a decent amount of editing you can do to vehicles with the exception of a few vehicles.

In my personal experience, it is not a bad game and many things can be improved about the game. 
I not sure why but, I stated just this on the forums and got banned for a while and that removed a lot of my like for the game.

I will recommend the game as it is fun and has a lot of content, but be aware it seems easy to get into trouble.",1

6361,Thoroughly love the game but it seems like the port to Steam was a miss. Unfortunately I couldn't get the Microsoft store version due to the limitation of my card and after seeing how badly this performs on the same machine when compared to the Microsoft store version really makes me sad but ig I have a toxic relationship with this game.,0
6362,nice game bruh,1
6363,"Pretty easy to play, I am not able to understand what the challenge is, I am feeling like I am just wasting time.
Waiting on the loading screens so long, user interaction have problems, 
In the 7 challenges after a challenge it moves you out to the external world, than suddenly loads challenge menu, then  you are back to the other challenge, before each race waiting the scenario screen is also long.
I was expecting more from this game , uninstalling ultimate edition after playing 7 hours.

After fixing the crashes on my end the game seemed to work fine and was fun to play. However the latest update on average the game crashes at least twice per day. If you can get it on a discount do but dont pay full price.",1

6382,great game but online barley works never connects to sessions,0
6383,"Thumb down because I met cons earlier than pros in-game. Still a nice race game, but:

Cons:
-Unskipble endless ads of DLS's.
-Unskipble cutscenes.
-Unskippable long introductions to the new race-tracks. You need to wait every like 5 mins until in-game voice will tell you all ""funny"" jokes about it, and only then let you go.
-No option to permanently turn off radio (you can only set it to 1, not 0).
-No setting to turn of music for menu or cutscences (at all).
-Characters are terrible, disgusting face quality (as if developers paid only 20$ to novice 3D designers)
-No car-damage system, too arcade (there are a couple of settings, but visually the car remains intact...)
-Poor difficulty settings (no difference between average and pro - npc's behave like wooden logs on the road).
-No chalange to get points, becouse you get them from every single move, literally - even when you CRUSH into something, or BUMP nps's cars. L - logic.
-Dump npc's cars which will bump you 10 times untill reaise that player's car stand still all this time and only THEN npc will go around.

Pros:
+it is surprising (after all cons), but it is still a good race game
+nice rally mechanics
+at least you can decorate your terrible face with a mustache
+a LOT of cars (400+ of them)
+no crashes AT ALL (wow)
+graphics is excellent + excellent optimization (my PC isn't powerful at all, but FH4 runs smoothly as hell)
+you can waist a lot of hours in it, i can feels it (and its working for that kind of game prefectly)",0

6390,"One of the best simulator games I've ever played. Races, Cars, etc are just great. But the downside of this game is, the driving mechanism is easy to learn, but quite hard to master. I'm using a controller to play this game, and sometimes I found myself in a bad position, such as understeer, oversteer, etc. But, the details, graphics especially, races, etc is what makes me like this game so much",1
6391,"[b]TLDR:[/b] Not fundamentally bad, actually pretty solid at its core, but many bad development choices and inconsistent quality control compound to drag down the experience.  Imagine if Ubisoft made a racing game and you have Forza Horizon 4.  I don't recommend as there are plenty of other racing games out there without half the problems, but it's not fundamentally broken and may be worth a buy for you.

[b]The Game[/b]
Core gameplay is pretty good, certainly a cut above your run of the mill arcade racer.  Controls somewhere between Need For Speed and Grid depending on your realism settings, seems to me like max realism gets into simcade territory, but I don't actually know enough about cars to tell you if that's accurate.  Sound effects are not bad but pretty bland, collisions are very low impact and jarring in how not-jarring they are.  Almost zero model damage, but the models are beautiful so you could consider it a tradeoff.  There's a pretty robust although clunky sticker-based livery customization system.  Minus points for having a Valvoline sticker but not letting you put it on the corner of your windshield though.

The ""open world"" aspect of the level is kinda cool in that you can drive through many areas that you would expect to have invisible walls, but you have to get used to the weird logic of what is and isn't destructible in the world as well.  Solid stone walls lining country roads - explode into gibs with minimal impact the moment you touch them.  Plastic containers sitting by road in a town - part of the terrain model and will instantly reduce your speed to 0.  You can also get stopped in your tracks by ropes coming from the sides of tents.  Despite encountering things like that regularly, it's typically not intrusive.  The in game GPS meant to help you navigate the world is completely broken and was clearly not even playtested.  I won't try to explain it, you can look up some gameplay and see for yourself.  Thankfully it wouldn't be necessary even if it did work.

The ""Everyone you see is playing in the same world"" thing is an outright lie, unfortunately.  You will see other players marked in your game, but it is just a player's car and name from the database taking the place of a standard traffic vehicle.  They use the same AI as the standard traffic too, they won't even speed around or try to race you like Burnout Paradise rivals.

There are characters for some reason.  A whole lot of them.  The designs, writing, and voice acting are incredibly unnatural and can get to be a bit much as all voice acting is unskippable and unmutable.  It reads and sounds identical to that weird Ubisoft style where everyone looks and talks like washed up hollywood actors but it's played 100% straight.  I find it really off putting, but I can see how it could easily be a plus for some if you find that kind of writing endearing or entertaining, so whether it's a pro or con is up to your preference.

Either way, one thing to note is that there's so much unskippable voice acting that the game frequently outpaces the voice acting and starts to build up a queue of voice clips.  It can be really funny when the same poorly written voice lines start repeating non-stop in certain missions where there are too many scripted triggers, but if you ever decide you've had enough, you'll unfortunately find that you can't mute them.  Seriously, the audio slider for Voice Effects prevents you from setting it to 0.  It's also a problem when you're stuck staring at the screen after a race as the queued up voice clips try to catch up with whatever post race animations are long past.

Menus aren't awful, but they're dangerously close to bad.  Borderline Ubisoft quality, but at least the settings are on the first page of the menu (what settings there are at least.)  This seems to be a consistent underlying theme of this game.  The devs seemed to take a whole lot of inspiration from the Ubisoft approach for some reason, from unnecessary menus to half baked social media systems to inconsistent quality control to weird unironic dystopian ""corporate smile"" writing and aesthetics.  But at least the core gameplay isn't broken, at least as far as I tried it.

[b]Performance[/b]
Performance wise, it's actually a surprisingly stable game, especially for one with fancy ""current-gen"" graphics.  One of the only games I've played period that hasn't given my worthless AMD GPU any trouble, actually really impressive.

As multiplayer and servers and all that, I didn't try it.

[b]The biggest reasons for the negative review:[/b]
Keybinds are heavily and arbitrarily restricted, and some controllers are totally barred from rebinding due to requiring a minimum number of extra buttons.  Saving new keybinds requires you to bind additional functions not part of the default control scheme.  If you don't have enough buttons for the extra functions (you may only assign one function per button) you are not allowed to save your bindings.  You are also not allowed to clear individual bindings.  You must either replace them with a unique button or totally clear all of your bindings and reassign them all.

You are also forbidden from rebinding freelook to the right stick of a controller.  The default requires you to hold up on the rightstick to enable freelook and then roll the stick along the edge to look left or right.  Otherwise the right stick will only snap the camera to different views, and if you don't keep the right stick pushed all the way to the edge after pushing it up to enable freelook, it will also stop freelook and snap to those views.  You may disable or rebind the snap views, but you may not rebind freelook, only disable it.

And as I mentioned earlier, you are forbidden from turning off the prevalent voice acting; there is a setting that allows you to turn it down to a certain extent, but then the slider prevents you from totally turning it off, and there is no way to skip voice lines that take control of the game away from you until they're finished.

I didn't search too deeply, but I was unable to find any mods that unlocked the settings.

[b]In closing...[/b]
I wouldn't say it's a bad game, but in my few hours of playing it compiled enough unnecessary annoyances and outright rotten development choices (constant unskippable/unmutable voice acting and arbitrarily restricted options) that it just was not worth it to me when there are so many alternatives for customizable racing action without all the BS.

If you're interested in it, I'd recommend looking into some actual extended gameplay footage and more thorough reviews.  If it still looks promising to you and you think you could have a good time with it then go for it!  But if you're not totally sold and not desperate for a brand new racing game, then maybe give this one a pass.

Note: At the time of writing this review it is still new to Steam and fairly pricey.  If you're reading this a few years from now and the price has dropped to $5 or something, it may be worth a shot then, especially if mods for proper options menus are available.",0

after playing this game for 80 hours its actually very fun, the handling is pretty good and the graphics not bad (playing on low graphics quality because of my system is slightly above the minimum requirement) the racing sometimes can be frustrating because if you're racing against drivatar(AI/BOT) they sometimes rubber-bands in front of you preventing you to overtake (usually happened in Expert-Unbeatable difficulty), and the car is very nicely done. 




*My original review when i got stuck while loading the game
I play this game for a good 1 and a half hour now and there's no problem at all, my pc can run it at 40-60 fps. then i turn the game off to do something else, then after i launch the game again its keeps crashing when loading my save file. if anyone know how to fix it help me by commenting. for now its a NO for me

6437,"Pretty amazing car game. But I wouldn't call it a 1 racing game. It's pretty arcade-y, the road races lack oomph, as in they are just regulated street races basically. There are no 1 racing circuits in this game. The rally races are also not very rally since like 70% of the race is spent on asphalt roads.

However, the upside is the drifting road segments all over the map, most of them are fun to do, and with tuning, almost any in the game can be drifted. They also have a wide selection of cars in the game, to satisfy whatever car needs you have. The tuning mechanic in the game is also pretty fun and very detailed. I wish I had more control over how my car looks beyond just liveries and paint jobs. It'll be great to also customise the interior, but it's a lot to ask for.",1
6438,"If you don't like the direction of modern AAA games, you'll find this absolutely disgusting.

And they just keep doing it, it's not just the first few tutorial parts. They're persistent.

6486,"Got the game on sale for $19.99.  I had pirated Forza Horizon 5 and wanted to try out some of the online aspects of the game but didn't want to pay $60 so I went with Forza Horizon 4.  FH4 is pretty much the same exact game as FH5 but in a different location (Britain instead of Mexico).  Technically the game is slightly easier on your video card, but both games look identical.  The game looks decent and runs well; I haven't suffered many FPS issues at all and have kept 60+ FPS.

I have trouble recommending this game.  I really enjoy realistic racing games but they all struggle with tying a narrative to what would be an excel grid of races.  All races take place on a world map that's completely open from the start of the game.  You go to various locations to start a race event there.  You do the race and you're put back on the map to go drive to another race location.  However, the races are too damn short.  Sure there are road, rally, and cross country racing, there's drag racing and drifting competitions but they all get finished within 3 minutes.  There's only 2 races that last 10 minutes in the 100 hours I've played this game.  I'm a huge fan of 20 minute to 1 hour endurance races which this game just doesn't have.

The reward system sucks.  You don't really make much money to buy all the cars you want but rather are given random cars as you play through the game.  Sometimes you get nice cars, sometimes you have to buy them with your limited funds, and sometimes you have to overpay for good cars that people auction off.  I probably made about $10 million in my 100 hours and the best and most sought after cars start at $12 million on the auction house so only dedicated or lucky players will get those cars.  There are side missions that you can do where you purchase a business, drive some type of vehicle really fast, and then you get a score of 1-3 stars.  Every couple of days you are paid based on how many stars you've earned so far but the amount of money you get is only just enough to pay for the upgrades on a car and not for a new car itself.

I purchased FH4 for the online features but sometimes it takes up to 30 minutes just to get an online race going plus 5-10 minutes in between each 3-minute race.  These loading times have you stuck on a loading screen too; you're not allowed to drive around the map gathering collectibles or trying to do side quests, you're stuck looking at a camera rotate around your car while your avatar constantly dabs at you because you thought it would be a funny emote to use.  Even though you're racing against other people, online features really don't exist for this game other than downloading other people's liveries and tuning setups.  You can't use your mic even though some how other people can have theirs turned on without them knowing its on (and you can't mute them).  You can't type to people, you can only use Rocket League-esque quick emotes.  You can see other people on the map and drive by them but they are ghosted and can't be rammed or whatever.  Any kind of online feature you're looking for in this game will need to be found by you outside the game.

I wouldn't recommend this game, nor would I recommend any other editions until they at least bring endurance races to the game.",0

6516,"All I wanted was to play a racing game with nice graphics. But this game is a cluster‚Ä¶ headache.

First, you are forced to sign in a Microsoft account. Then, you must play through an opening that feels like it should be a cinematic but you have to play through it. ‚ÄúEnjoy some quicktime events too,‚Äù says the game. Want to turn off the stupid music? Too bad! The best you can do is lower it to 1 out of 10. Then you‚Äôve got your character selection and custom number plate where you have to scroll through all the letters of the alphabet individually. It was at this point the game informed me there‚Äôs an inappropriate language block. Next were unskippable cut scenes, including camera pans around the car. Can you play now? No, you get the most frustrating selection menu ever encountered in a game. To go between races, you have to drive rather than scroll through a menu. There‚Äôs no track preview, at least not that I could tell. There‚Äôs no tutorial track. Am I playing against other players online or AI? I can‚Äôt tell. I just want some fun quick races against AI with nice graphics. Headache you, Microsoft, and your language filter. Whoever this game's audience is, it's not for me.",0

You can't skip time or seasons, should be an option to choose which time and season that player prefer to drive. You will stuck until the season change, story mission also effected by theses system too. And that's terrible cause once you stuck in winter, half of them is harder and annoying to play. Auction house is terrible, what people do is sniping bid when it less than 1 min left, no extended time. It's old game but the release tons of new content, not much game improvement but it understandable cause its old. Even their server still has issues all the time, and old players said dev doesn't care, it's never been fixed.

6530,"If you like all the cars they have great.
If you hate that there is so many arcade games like this that get all the cars but fail when in comes to a sim setting............

Yeah, this game is so arcade even on full sim settings its not funny. 

I and I think millions of others are waiting for a game like this or GT5 that actually lets you go full sim.....properly.....not half assed.

1. The FFB is terrible.
2. The tire physics are terrible.
3. The car and suspension physics are terrible.

If you want a free roam car game with tons of great cars and don't care that the sim settings don't actually make it a sim......this game is for you.

Yes I have fun sometimes, but mostly I'm constantly changing pre written down FFB settings for different cars to make it feel somewhat realistic for said cars. 
Even then, the handling on full sim is so out of this world that its no wonder young kids crash IRL. They think things work like forza or GT.

I want just ONE game, that lets the arcade boys get their fill, whilst also giving simmers a PROPER free roam sim.......just ONE.

For the life of me I cannot get this forza GTS to handle like my own GTSR, ive spent weeks trying but as close as you can sorta get with FFB, you cannot fix the physics model...its too arcade even on sim ""steering"".

Just one game like this please give a mode that simulates everything properly ffs, it is 2021 and RBR did most of the work for you back in what ? the 2000's ?",0

What a joke lol rail racers man :/ Now, this is most likely a failure of vernacular capabilities by the devs because I was able to get it driving fully manually with some weird tweaking. But have fun setting up the game map every single time you boot it up because this is one of those games that's flooded with ""features"" positioned places they expect players to see/use every login, in an effort to take over your day to day gaming life. That's an awful lot of commitment for not much diversity or character. All other gripes I can think of are just personal preference I suppose. Like medium to full customization options, actual realistic street racing, consequences instead of phasing through all other cars and getting a rewind button. Can you believe that btw?! A rewind button in a racing game lmao yea that's just simply not a community I wanna be a part of. All the power to ya if these things don't bug you, honestly. glhf",0

6540,"Absolutely terrible race experience. I wanted  play this game so badly but after 4+ hours attempting to get my Fanatec Podium setup so the car was controllable I'm out of patience. Once i finally got the wheel to a barely acceptable level of accuracy the game crashes every time I finish a race rendering any progress impossible.

Ok....couldn't get refund due to time spent tweaking settings. Had to ditch my Fanatec setup and use a gamepad to play this. Looks great, love the open world and the car selection. Still think it was a cash grab port to PC though.

After I stopped being a whiny little P$%#Y and tried a controller the glitches stopped, I finished my first race and the game world opened up. Now I'm addicted. Graphics are good, car selection is incredible and while this isn't close to a simulation it's really fun to play.",1
6541,"Very pretty but apparently requires several days of tweaking to make it playable. Evidently this is a racing game not designed to be played with a steering wheel. By default turning the wheel any amount to the right is full right, turning at all to the left is full left. This makes it impossible to control with a wheel. Again this is the default. An hour of adjusting the ""advanced wheel settings"" improved this somewhat but I was an hour in and still constantly fishtailing all over the road because the game is expecting me to be tapping a controller button. Oh and if you close the game your controller settings are erased which makes trouble shooting this a nightmare. Not taking the risk that this is unfixable and refund it is. That's the reality of a two hour refund window. If I can't get the game running in an hour - refund. There are plenty of other racing games out there. Hey Devs, get your default settings at least in the ballpark of workable.",0

6553,"[h1]Potential fix for cutscene and NPC annoyances[/h1]

Just delete their media files!

DISCLAIMER: by modifying your game files, you're risking [b]breaking your installation[/b] of it (easy to fix, see instructions further down) and maybe even [b]getting banned from online play[/b]. That last one is unlikely, but don't try this if you do care. [b]I won't make myself responsible for any issues that arise out of this[/b].

To access these files, you have to:
1. Right click on the game, then go to ""Manage"" > ""Browse Local Files"". This will open a new file explorer window.
2. Go into the ""media"" folder and wreak havok!

You might want to just rename files or move them around instead of deleting them, that's your choice.

Here's the ones I've found so far:
* Videos: <game folder>\media\ui\videos => I just deleted everything, you might want to keep some of them.
* Voice-overs: <game folder>\media\audio\fmodopus\x64\VO_<something else> => I deleted every file that starts with ""VO_"".

Next time you boot the game, you might see black screens instead of the usual intro videos depending on what you deleted. Don't fret! The game menu will come up. You'll also notice some assets, like animated banners and such, are now black. I haven't tested this too much, so I'm unsure of its effect on online play.

Note that future updates to the game will definitely restore these files, so be prepared to do it all over again.

To undo this, you have to:
1. Right click on the game, then click on ""Properties..."".
2. Click on ""Local Files"".
3. Click on ""Verify integrity of game files..."".
4. Let Steam do its thing. It should automatically start re-downloading the missing files.

[h1]Actual review[/h1]

I want to love this game. In fact, I might continue playing it regardless of my complaints.

OK, so first things first: why do you spend so much time on a racing game... not racing cars? There's a bajillion little interruptions and distractions. Unskippable intro, random unskippable cutscenes when you open the map or get out of a menu, tremendously disorganized menus... it's almost like the game doesn't want you to play it.

Speaking about the cutscenes... none of the NPCs enhance the game in any way. The game would be just as good if they were gone. You can't completely mute them using the voice-over volume settings either, so you're stuck hearing them babble on and on about nothing useful. It's downright miserable!

All of that is a shame, because there's a pretty good driving game underneath all the distractions and interruptions. A plethora of cars, lots of different driving modes, tons of online content... good luck getting to them though.",0

Most of the time, your car isn't going to be extremely grippy or turn enough but that's probably because it's a Volvo with a V12 going 250mph. 
The only thing I have discovered I don't like is that there is no immediate and quick way to visually repair your car. You can open up camera mode and repair then exit but otherwise I know of no other way.

Physics is just wow UNBEARABLE 
Cars feel slow when going 400 KM/h+ and I have the welcome pack Ferrari F50
Lets not start with the fricken poor taste of music geez
Graphics are stunning but the driving can be sooooo rugged and look I have played Forza before my Favy was Horizon 1 and Motorsport 3
This game feels empty as if they started to build something but finished at the walls 
Making money is so tediously time consuming and OMG the game is soooo boring and you cant even sell your old and worthless crap cars
After the first hour you will have 40 cars + that has no point whatsoever only a waste of space in my garage so yeah add a selling crap cars please
I tried CO-OP but this crap servers kicked us both every 15min and the lag is terrible
I play games like Fallout 76 and Destiny with max Video settings whilst Jamming tunes on Spotify without even the slightest of problems

Let me rate my Fav Forza games I played

Motorsport 2 is a 9/10 easy
Motorsport 3 10/10
Motorsport 4 7.6/10
Horizon 1 9.7/10
Horizon 3 6/10
HORIZON 4 get a upmost 2.3/10 for me the only thing I did enjoy was the graphics and the England scenic routes

This your honour is a crap game for me I hated every second and I`m so disapointed because I loved the previous games

6606,"Forza Horizon 4 Review:

PROS:

1. Very Good Optimization
2.Over 750+ Licensed Cars,For More Specified 752 Cars
3 .Stunning Visual
4.Big Open World With Lots Of Activities To Do
5. Season Changing System & It Actually Change Your Driving Style
6. Skills Are Tied To Your Cars



CONS:

1. Some Time I Can't Connect To The Horizon Session
2 .Some Time The Loading Time In Online Races Are Like Forever
3.Big Open World But Most Of The Roads But Not All Of Them.They Are Kinda Look Like Same No Variety
4.The DLC pop-ups are very annoying and kind of insulting looking at fact I bought the game for 70‚Ç¨ +  some starter packs...

- old rare cars you find you'll see in garage after their repairs are completed would be all stub black noname car (they look and work perfectly fine elsewhere)

UPDATE i cant even play now when ever i open it up it crashes right away. the review above still stands kind of maybe you will have more luck then me. but i am glad i did not spend $100 for this game. i would refund it but i am past the 2 hour mark by 30 hours i think.",0

If a barn find car pops up while at a Forzathon event it will keep popping up during the whole event. Forzathon events will require the same amount of points at each stage if you are all alone or you have 7 others or w/e the limit is.

Classes don't matter. Races can be raced by pretty much any car at any class so max everything out and go.",0

I thought i was going mad or something, that can't be right.

6761,"TL:DR | Game runs like hell, AI sucks, steering and controlling a vehicle is wacky, good luck even launching the game if their certain specifications aren't met. ANNNND XBOX live. Need i say more?

Can't recommend this game due to it not being able to run on my main computer. Controls feel wonky, even with a controller it seems steering doesn't match the speed your actually going. GRID 2 and DIRT Rally have masterpiece steering handling and work super well on a controller. Played all types of the game before refunding. AI is kind of dopey and rushed.  The game constantly makes you adjust the difficulty if you're doing really well against the difficulty your playing at, then as soon as the difficulty is raised, It's hell on wheels and your stuck in a bicycle while everyone has a bugatti. No progression, story is basic if you really want to call it a ""story"". They throw random highspeed race cars your way super early in the game instead of progressing to getting a higher tier of cars. This game is also incompatible with some computers and you are out of luck if you happen to be one of those ""incompatible"" as they still have NOT fixed launch issues, lag issues, error issues. Don't forget, this game is also on the microsoft store. lol.",0

The Graphics are amazing and the game play is really fun. but there's something that I really find annoying and makes me want to stop playing and that's when you want to race with other players. finding players in this game is not an Issue. even when Forza Horizon 5 is out the game still have plenty of players. what annoys me is when you play Online Adventure the game mode that makes you race with other players. the loading times TAKES AGES! it takes soooo long about 10 minutes or worse.

6778,"Mr Original Review was as follows:

Based on the limited time I had with it before refunding I can say for sure that during races, there was no stuttering. Back in the open world driving around there was constant stuttering and I did even also suffer a crash while a race loaded. Sadly as I had to refund this due to the technical issues, I don't know if others will encounter the same problems as I did, but on that experience, I can't recommend the steam version of Forza 4 for the time being.

Now, having revisited it a while later in 2022, I can now write the following;

Massive difference so far in performance, the stuttering I was encountering in the open world has gone and so far, has been more stable. There have been prompts for issues ""connecting to the network"" that the game flags up but as I've been playing solo, it's not really mattered. The major issues I had with the Steam version seem to have been resolved, so am now happier to recommend the game than I did before.",1

6786,"Not for a casual gamer who just want to sit back and relax after a long day of work. The physics of the game is, IMHO, even harder than actually driving a real-live car. I don't think a sedan will shake that much at 40-50 MPH when you steer it a little. And yes, I have tried the game in the easiest settings.

Moreover, I don't like how the AI behave: when you're driving a Ford supercar in a All-Ford Championship, a Ford truck will still manage to beat you in a more-or-less straight path, due to giving us the players ""sense of challenge"". It's unrealistic and force you to be mechanically perfect in driving your cars, and eliminate any sense of progression since buying a faster car doesn't do much in helping you winning a race.",0

IT'S THE EXACT SAME FECAL MATTER WITH UPDATED GRAPHICS AND A WANNABE NEED FOR SPEED OPEN MAP.  Perhaps one day in the next 15 years they might actually UPDATE THIS FUCKING SERIES.

EA Sports would be particularly proud of how Turn10 has treated this series.  All that said, if you have decent racing wheel gear, this series is still the best racing you can get on PC.  ONLY BUY THIS OR OTHER FORZA TITLES ON SUPER DEEP DISCOUNTS.

30 SECONDS LATER EDIT:  Just to be clear, you'll have to use any racing wheel gear in conjunction with X360CE.  At minimum.  I personally have to combine X360CE and REWASD to play this garbage how I want.  THANKS MICROSOFT!!!!

All of my complaints above are still valid; I'm giving a thumbs up NOW after dealing with the poorly optimized nightmare that is 'NEED FOR SPEED: HEAT' and it's one eyed, bearded, hunchback mother ORIGIN.

6860,"Okay, fine, I'll make an actual review for the game.

Forza has been on my radar since I started playing PC games back in 2015, but I always had an alternative version of it, aka Gran Turismo 6 and Sport, but now not having a PS4 gives me a great reason to play these racing sims and racing games on Steam and other PC platforms, and by god is it fun. But where others stand out in realism, or drift arcade styles, Forza is what I wish Gran Turismo had, it's the love child of the classic arcade fun of Need For Speed with the systems of casual racing sims, hardcore but accessible tuning and a huge selection of cars, tracks and racing modes.

Forza Horizon takes that concept of casual racing sim fun and cracks it over it's back, breaking the norm and introducing some of the most fun I have had in a racing game since Gran Turismo 4 on the PS2. This game is fucking amazing, the visuals are excellent, the community is fantastic, the driving is ""arcady"" AND simulator-like, the game has so many tunes for the hundreds of cars available in the BASE GAME, the DLCs are not needed at all to get hundreds to thousands of hours of gameplay out of, the game is fucking brilliant.

I love this game, I suggest wholeheartedly to buy this game on sale and experience what Microsoft and Playground Games have to offer. I am excited to buy Forza Horizon 5 when it's price lowers to around 30 bucks or so.

10/10 No stupid third party software nonsense, no in-game bloat, no dlc requirements (they push dlc a bit too hard though in game with ads for them playing from time to time) and no limits to what you can't do. I love tuning a supra to be able to rally, and a mini cooper to be as fast as a super car.",1
6861,"One of the most deviously effective horror games I've played. It begins with the selection of an avatar, 99% of which are Nic Cage wearing a frozen Moonstruck grimace, the other is an android sent secretly to destroy the human race. 
You enter the racing festival of Stepford Drives, in which everyone has a terrifying veneer of cheer beneath which lurks their plot to replace all humans with fake ones, identified by their grimacing grin. The radio DJs were the first to go. 
Navigating through the sanitized candy floss experience feels less Fast & Furious and more morning TV show, with the tension escalating as it becomes harder to maintain your own outwardly happy mood after being stuck spinning your wheels after the 666th side drift into a tree. But you cannot let that mask crack, no matter how many times your car spins out before you've even started steering, because then you'll reveal yourself as the last human bean and they will come for you... they're probably already coming for you right now...",0

There even is a way to turn a .png into a graphics file for the game to use, so you can put literally every existing waifu on your car ‚Äî now that's a custom job! 
A few words about the cars: they are incredibly easy to get. Even with zero DLC's and VIP passes you can pretty much buy anything you want with the money you earn in-game, without grinding ‚Äî not even mentioning all the barn finds that are 100% free and take less than five minutes to be found. 
For an arcade, Forza Horizon 4 has astonishing physics. It's not based on drift and jumps, like NFS Payback, for instance; thus, drifting & jumping are not always the fastest way to go around the track, which is... well, realistic. This also makes the game a little more skill-based than ""fly through a barn sideways, then finish first"" type of racing games. Of course, there's almost no damage to your vehicle whatsoever, and you get points for destroying stuff around you, but Forza doesn't make it necessary to do so. Grip and slip angle still rule the asphalt here. 
To sum up, this is your (almost) ideal racing game. Don't hesitate to try it out ‚Äî you won't regret it! The only question is what, for the love of God, is Lego Speed Champions?",1

6924,"This game really sucks. You can hardly turn when going over 30 mph, in any vehicle. Your car will also randomly steer to the left / right out of nowhere. This game is also pretty much impossible with a racing wheel because of the understeer on every vehicle. EVERY vehicle. Waste of money, would not recommend.",0

6929,"Let's start off with the good stuff. The game looks and sounds great. If all you care about is graphics and ear candy, read no more.

Now for the not so good stuff. 

The higher level cars are very difficult to control. The inputs from a standard game controller feel extremely binary. The breaks and accelerator are either all the way on or all the way off. The steering is either all the way to the left or right no matter how delicately you try to coax minor path adjustments. This results in constant fishtailing and going off course. It might seem picky to downvote a driving game for being unplayable without a steering wheel setup, but they're expensive. I picked this game up on discount hoping to have some cheap fun, but you NEED a $300 steering wheel setup to really play it. That $300 would go a long ways towards a console purchase.

Also, there's basically no story and no real sense of game progression. This game is missing either the licensing system from Gran Turismo or the story and arcadey mechanics of something like NFS Carbon to make it a great GAME. The season system is weak sauce, and you don't even have to WIN to get through the seasons. It manages to not be either a simulator or a decent arcade racer. It doesn't really know what it wants to be, and it turns into a big nothing the more you play.

tl;dr - 24 hours in and I'm frustrated and bored stiff with the game. People still looking for a better racing game than the old NFS games or Gran Turismo should keep looking. This isn't it IMO",0

6991,"This is a fun, good quality racing game with serious flaws in the game design:
- There are video ads one cannot skip and which pop up randomly during gameplay. This is an audacity for a full price game!
- The physics engine is absolutely awful. Objects basically consist of two materials in the game: Cardboard and solid steel. Driving through trees and stone walls has almost zero impact on your vehicle. Ridiculous!
- The setting with the Forza Horizon festival is rather childish and the colorful menu design is hideous.
- There is a permanent internet connection required, since this game merges on- and offline and you cannot choose to play this game only in singleplayer. No matter the setting presets, there are always other players on the map as well as DLC-events you would have to pay for. Not what I expect from a full price triple-A game!
- No manual save games possible.
- On top of it all, there are some bugs where your car gets stuck in objects or falls through the floor.

Overall, the Forza Horizon series is outrageously overprized. FH4 is max. 10 bucks worth, maybe 15 with all DLCs. This might be a nice little gift for your kids, but will not satisfy any old-established gamer.",0

6993,"Open world RPG where you grind for upgrades until you are done with the game (with rubberbanding).  NOT a racing sim.  Dirt 2 is way better.  In one race, you race a train who's speed and finish time depends on the quality of car you have.  Worse car? Train finishes slower, but you probably still lose.  Best car? Train finishes faster, but you probably still win.

And why do I always buy the wrong pack?  I got the ultimate edition because I thought it would be a better deal.  Wrong, it just gives you the absolute best car in the game from the beginning, thereby killing all the progression content that is literally the entire game.

7033,"Forza Horizon 4 was a great game for 70 hours. Extremely fun, entertaining, great racing game, amazing customizability, and great racing. And then while playing an online game it completely crashed. I started the game up again and showed the intro then a black screen then the text was glitching out then it crashed. I opened it again and it crashed immediately when I opened it. I wasted a day looking up useless videos on YouTube and now I'm conceited that I'm probably not going to be able to play it again. Honestly, it baffles me how useless Microsoft is at exclusives. Unless you're playing it on Xbox it's not going to work properly. I've had a PlayStation my entire life. I never really wanted an Xbox except for wanting to play Forza. I finally got a computer that can run a Forza game. And guess what? The game I actually wanted breaks after 70 hours. Incredible! Yeah, I cannot repeat how fun the game was before it stopped working but unfortunately, it stopped working.",0

but the game has sound issues. the cutscenes are very loud and i need to adjust the volume. everytime a cutscenes happens. and this game has a lot of cutscenes.

i found the fix for the sound issues. but that fix, degrade my sound quality when playing the game.

and what makes me finally not recommending this game is that. the game itself lacks direction. it feels too free. and that makes me confused on what to do inside the game.

free roam is a good thing. if done well.. this feels like a free roam with a lot of random races tucked in.
and it confuses me on what races i can do or should do.
because to get to the races. i need to go there. and i can't just pick a race and then go racing. and insanely fast travel = credit spend.

that whole thing. ruined the game for me. i would probably just do free roam once in a while. and then exit the game. the whole i need to go to the exact place to do racing = not my thing.",0

Graphics very nice, physics great, gameplay excellent, endless content...a good game then?

The biggest problem is that there is no challenge, once you get rolling in dough you get best cars nicest upgrades and all that and it remains yours, ah and you get a lot of shit for free too which takes away even further any challenge this game could ever pose. What id really like to see is the police that could confiscate your cars and ability to play police yourself and stop other player cars, now that would be awesome, then having nice cars would actually mean something, right now everything is meaningless and for this reason I can not recommend this game and will not be picking up forza 5.",0

On one hand, the concept is amazing and the loads of cars in it is just astonishing. But it ends there.
For PC users, this game is not enjoyable at all. Most cars simply oversteer. You cant properly drive off the starting line without spinning. This can be fixed by lowerign the drivign difficulty, where you simply loose some bonuses. And then the only option is to download presets for each car to be grippy.
The game ""story"" is so boring and jsut cringy. Some races and the festival itself is jsut a joke. They jsut keep throwing races at you with no purpose. Seasons keep changing with no reason either here and there.
You drive half way across the map to get to a race and suddently, oh noo, drive here to this event.

Basically, I made sure that Microsoft could receive as little data from me as possible.

Xbox, being a Microsoft company, noticed this, and seemingly ""locked"" the game, preventing the launch. To sum this all up, Microsoft wants my data, I refused, and then they decided to make it crash. Waste of ¬£20, if you ask me.

7111,"I hit recommend ONLY due to the fact that it holds 1 to the Forza franchise. Which can be exactly what you wanted or the exact opposite. As with any and all Forza's. The same exact problems are still incredibly obvious. My 2 least favorite issues that seem to be completely and utterly ignored with no intent to fix are. 

1.) When you set the difficulty setting higher, you don't drive smarter AI. They just have less handicaps than you. Which might not bother some. But if ""I"" am going to lose, I want to lose due to driving. Not because rain doesn't effect my opponents tires.

2.) If you DO NOT tune EACH and EVERY setting in a vehicle BEFORE attempting to drive it in any way shape or form, regardless of the make or model. You will be attempting to control a piece of wet cardboard stuck in a high wind. It is truly insulting to fans of the real cars to see them perform like such pathetic Pinto's. For example, At no point in history should I get into a Lambo or Porsche and have zero control over where my car is going. It just doesn't add up. I can personally tell you from my very limited and very lucky times I have been able to drive a Porsche. Let me tell you, you DO NOT feel like you don't have control of the car, no matter how fast you are going. It just IS NOT authentic in any way at all when it comes to you ""Feeling"" like you are behind the wheel of the actual car.

That being said. It is still a fun driving game. But if you want to just be able to buy a car and race it like it should perform out of a showroom. You will be horribly disappointed.",1

7135,"I've played a fair few racing/driving games before this, but mainly old ones like Daytona USA and Ridge Racer. Hell, the newest one I played was Gran Turismo 4, which was on PS2! So to come from games like that to THIS... It hits different.

It's surprisingly really well optimised, my outdated little GTX 970 can run the game perfectly smoothly at ~60fps on medium settings. It's visually stunning and captures the atmosphere of Great Britain brilliantly, and all the cars' models and materials look perfect. The radio music selections are great, although I mainly just stick to Horizon XS. The balance between fun and realism in controlling the cars is completely on-point. And of course, being a Forza Horizon game, it's open-world, so you can take everything at your own pace, do loads of cool stunts and tricks, practice drifts around corners, whatever the hell you want. Apparently the online multiplayer isn't as good, with lobby load-times being comparable to GTA Online, but I can't be arsed to do any of that anyway.

This game has also frozen so damn much for me, I have 8GB RAM which isn't much, but the game shouldn't be freezing because of it when I'm on medium settings and have nothing else open. It has screwed me over a LOT, and is the main reasons I don't have more hours on the game. For a ¬£54.99 game from 2018 I expect far better optimisation.

If you love racing games, get this whenever you can (probably the standard edition, it's already pretty damn expensive as it is). If you're not too sure, probably wait for a sale. Wouldn't recommend getting Deluxe or Ultimate editions unless they're on a good discount, like 50% off or over.",1

Sadly I can't recommend this open-world driving game. It's fun for about 70% of it but when you start to get into the real racing mini-games especially the Street Race ones. The game really loves to fuck you over at every last second it can get.

_____________________________________________________________________
Pros:
- FUN OPEN-WORLD.
- Nice selection of cars and customisation.
- Sound and Music is nice.
- 50% of the racing games [Race, Cross Country, Dirt-Road, Drag etc] are decent.
- Looks amazing.

Cons:
- Terrible NPC system.
[ Links to the Street Race games. They just LOVE to randomly spawn in NPC cars that you CAN NOT avoid causing you to crash and lose a race even when you are a few feet from the finishing line plus the NPC opponents sometimes drive like complete shit. They tend to be in the exact same spot you need to be in to perfectly make a 90* degree turn. ]

- The other 50% of the racing games like Street Races.
[ Again the NPC cars and NPC opponents tend to get in your way plus some of the race tracks have really nasty 90* degree turns one race has a 90* degree turn in the first 2 seconds of the starting line. ]

- Some of the open world activity's like drifting, danger signs and speed traps can be quite bullshit on how they are set up.
[ Like a Speed Trap or Speed Zone that consists of really tight turns and you can't seem to be able to go over 100mph on some of them. As well as some of the drift zones don't even register your points and sometimes if not 80% of the time, you miss the gate/checkpoint and it fails you due to the gate/checkpoint being in a really stupid spot, too close to a turn. ]

- It also tends to crash quite a fair bit.
- PLUS THE RNG IS A FUCKING NIGHTMARE IN THIS GAME
_____________________________________________________________________
GET THIS GAME if you like the open-world stuff and just driving a large selection of good looking cars.

Don't get this game if you want a 1 racing experience that doesn't fuck you over. Almost all the time.",0

Amazing game. Graphics are very good and clear. There are so many things to do in Forza Horizon 4, like races, and much more. It is easy to get cars and the more you level up the more you get. Now to the question you are probably wondering well scrolling through the feedback section, ""why does this game crash for some people"". My game hasn't crashed once and i think it is because when you load up forza there is a option to jump into the game or to do a benchmark mode test first. DO THE BENCH MARK MODE TEST. This will optimize the game settings to your computer so the game doesn't crash. I got this game 35% off and it was a steal, I recommend it. (best racing game on steam)",1

Some days it will be fine and then an hour later it's a mess. If they ever fix the issue I will change my review because I love the game other than the technical issues that it's plagued by.",0

7251,Game constantly crashes. I have 50 hours in this game and the game crashed over 100 times. 70 euro for a 5 year old unstable game...,0
7252,Freedom,1
7253,"I don't care about the constant game crashes, I can live with that. The biggest problem with this game is the AI. Unless you tune your cars to be optimal, or even broken at times, the AI will always out power your car. It's the lazy, bs way of ramping up difficulty. There's tons of rubberbanding when your're leading a race, which is one of the most annoying things in racing games, just make the AI better, don't give them better cars and have rubberbanding in races. At higher difficulties, the other drivers will try to ram you off the road when you pass them, which is insanely frustrating, they literally swerve one way and swerve back to hit you, or pit you on corners when you're passing them. 

But the worst part of this game is the Cross Country and Street Races. Really any time there are variables outside of normal racing, Forza Horizon 4 drops the ball immensely. Jumps for instance are the biggest crapshoot of all time, especially because the off road vehicles drive like they're on ice, if you don't hit the jumps exactly straight, which you usually won't, it can ruin a race immediately. On top of that, most jumps feature these stupid tires at the corners of the side walls which are hard walls that cause your car to come to a complete stop. Like wtf. my car going 150 comes to a complete stop when gracing a tire wall, but I can plow through 90% of the trees and metal poles in this game??!? Also to note about how shit the cross country races are; the terrain obstacles like destructible stone walls, hay bales, trees, etc., you know dumb shit your car can go through without a scratch, but you can't graze a tire, don't load in for the cars outside of your immediate vicinity (even when on max rendering settings). So basically, when all the cars around you are crashing into dumb bales of hay in the middle of the field, the cars in 1st and 2nd never even had to deal with those obstacles, and on top of having insane power and perfect handling, you now have to deal with a wall of crashing cars, so you may as well restart the race.

This is a common theme in this game. Variables outside of your control that the first 2 or so cars don't have to deal with, you do, and you may as well restart. Street Races are possibly the worst, there's a crash on just about every corner (which is where you need to make up time because you're not gonna out power the AI), and the first 2 cars don't render in the obstacle that everyone else is held up on, so now they're way ahead, and you should restart. Street Races devolve into a game of random chance that hopefully there are no crashes at all in front of you, so you can then race perfectly to beat the AI. Otherwise again, just about every turn will have a crash or pile up of cars that you can't gain time on, it's stupid. I can live with crashes, bugs, or poor performance, but bad game design is bad game design, which sucks because I really, really like the rest of the game outside the frustrating AI mechanics, but given how bad it can be at higher difficulties, the preposterous price tag for a 3 year old game, oh yeah, and the fact that it crashes at least twice every time I play. Just save yourself the headache and buy Forza Horizon 5 when it comes out, probably in the next 1.5 years.

Also P.S. STOP FUCKING TELLING ME TO RAMP UP THE DIFFICULTY FROM PRO TO UNBEATABLE FORZA!!! FIX YOUR SHITTY AI AND MAYBE I WILL!",0

Plus drifting on ice was fun.  The issue I have with the game is the amount of talking with no way to skip.  It is beyond terrible.  Not only are the lines trash, but after anything and everything I do in the game, they have to pause the game for me to tell me about a new feature or dlc for 5 minutes.  This game is terrible in that regard.  If you love driving games, this one is a lot of fun.  Especially when you have a group of friends to drive around with.

The developers posted a thread on ""Fix"" for crashes, where they just copy pasted a passage which they apparently also copy&paste under every threads on the topic everywhere else. What's more, they locked the comments for whatever the reason and hence blocked player feedback.
There's not even a ""trouble shooting& bug report"" section on the community, which even most indie games have these days.
So my opinion to this: The dev team does not care about players, and are not showing enough determinations to get things fixed. If you're running the game just fine, good luck of you. But I just can't support such a game published by Microsoft, yet so frustrating even just to make it run.",0

Sure $60 for the standard edition is a bit much for a 2-3 year old game, but if you have never played this or anything like an open world racing game then this game will feel brand new to you and worth the price. 

Pros:
Graphics are amazing
The sound and music is great quality
There is so much things to do you will feel overwhelmed at first
A huge number of different cars to try out and collect
You can spend hours just customization, tuning, and painting different cars
Lots of things to do in the open world like explore, drifting, speed traps, and stunt jumps
Changing weather and seasonal challenges
Multiple different houses you can purchase
Multiple story lines and jobs that add to the forza life style

Cons:
Game tends to crash sometimes. For me the problem was mostly fixed by going into solo mode
Screen shuttering seems to be a common problem. Sometimes during racing but mostly during cut scenes",1
7345,"Really happy to see this come out on steam! As it was only on Xbox, me being a PlayStation /PC player. I've always wanted it, but i want buying a Xbox just to play one game.. lol. Love the graphics, and how realistic it is, compared to Need For Speed games. (I know they aint really anything alike) but ive not played  anything apart from NfS.
Its a great change to me, although tuning my cars... i gotta look that up! lol as i have no clue what im doing half the time. xD But Overall im super happy with the game!
I love the season idea, it totally does change the game, and their is always something to do! From (races, rallys, taxi's, Championships, Owning houses, finding barns for old exotic cars, or even daily challenges) 
Also the wheel spins.. im addicted to them :D but yes 9/10 from me :D!!!",1

7359,"Why is the force feedback on my thrustmaster wheel inverted, an the invert setting has no effect. Why when I try to rebind button, I am forced to choose Custom, but then not all buttons actually have an effect (some do) and continue to be default TS-PC binding which cannot be changed. Why does the audio at the start of the game cut out? Why does accessibility read the menu despite the settings for both windows and the game. Why does steam overlay take focus and require manual exit every time the game starts. Why do the scrollbars behave oddly in menus, becoming longer like there are more items being added, rather than moving, depending on the selected item and movement direction.

Looks like it should have been a fun game, and likely on console these were non-issues. I really wanted to get some miles on my wheel, and maybe these issues can be overcome, but I put 1.4hrs into attempting configuration, where other racers work much better out of the box, and I'm still playing in menus here.

Really like to see the inclusion of games on Stream, and would like to have supported more of that. If the game was 20 bucks because it's 3 years old, and included etc cars/dlc, I probably would have kept going, maybe dig into files and find a way to edit the default TS-PC profile, but at full price... I'm just glad to have Steam, reviews, and refunds.

Also, the built in benchmark, 4k 60FPS on a 1080TI, it was very smooth and nice, but the game surely doesn't run that way. I doesn't help to doctor the bench, like it makes the game run better. An accurate bench should help with configuration, after all it's the point.",0

The stunning visual quality and sound design, the massive array of automobiles, and the extensive and completely customisable career mode that have become hallmarks of the Horizon series are all here.

7408,"My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and adopted our son together. They are now both 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I found myself lost and miserable. I was self destructive. I got so mad one day from everything spiraling out of my control that I punched some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion. That caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand... my working hand... my games hand.. the hand that I held and carried my children to bed with.. The hand I desperately needed to make sure I could continue to provide.

After learning of the severity of my self-inflicted damage, I was borderline suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety. I have never had fits of rage, or been one to break down and cry, but I was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side.

Having nothing better to do, I searched for a game I could play, ONE HANDED while I recovered. I somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews. I decided that it had to be worth a shot... I must admit, I didn't beat the game, or play nearly as long as some of you. In fact, I may have only played this game a day or two.. With that being said, after doing so, I had a new found joy and hope for life. I was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me. I was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness. I was able to see the fruits of my ""labor"". I relaxed for 5 ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• minutes to this music long enough to realize that I was going to be okay.

After coming to that realization, I turned the game off, and I went back to work. It hurt my hand like hell but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself, and I became the father I needed to be in that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving as.

Today, I am close friend with my kids mother. We don't fight, or argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents, and friends.

I now have 3 kids. My third child is, wait for it, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my own separation, and we just stumbled in to each others life unexpectedly. We have been in a relationship for a year now, and are very happy together.

Moral of the story, you never know what life holds in store for you, and if I would have given up when all the odds were stacked against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

Thank you",1

-Price is really good
-A lot of cars like Crew 2
-If you want to get a singleplayer race experience this is your game, but if you want to race like Crew 2, this is not your game. Go keep playing Crew 2. For me both games are great.

Oh what a surprise I had when I've launched game through steam.... no cars no progress... (AND I DID FULLY FINISHED THE GAME WITH ALL DLC etc.) nothing even though Steam is linked to XBOX. I refuse to believe that you can't transfer progress... they are just LAZY, not limited , it was done in the past with other  games, they are just PLAIN LAZY. 

In short : Purchased this game TWICE and am very disappointed that you can't transfer progress to steam. Developers are lazy as hell  and that's why for now i can't recommend this game  (beside all the problems it has already on steam)

I'll just keep playing through MS Store for now.",0

Anyways the racing aspect was alright, Multiplayer though was just not what I wanted. You can't have a private session with just you and your buds, like you could in FH3. It ran absolutely horrible with me but that's somewhat on me. This game seems fun if you don't mind being with 60 other random people and things running somewhat bad.

7476,"It's a decent racing game at best. There's enjoyable aspects to this game like the amount of options you have when it comes to racing, customization, and vehicles you could choose. The miscellaneous things such as the drone and the picture mode are convenient and dope.

Now I've mostly spent time playing arcade racers like Need for Speed and Burnout. I know this is a arcade/simulation type of racer and I can adapt to that but there's things in this game that just irritate me while playing. 

- The constant cutscenes in this game is extremely annoying, and the dialogue from characters in the game are just annoying. Plus having character customization in a racing game is the most stupidest thing ever and having to these ugly characters weirdly smile every time I finish a race is something I don't want to see at all.

 - For a racing game the engine sounds are not that good. I recently played Hot Pursuit 2010 and that game made me appreciate the sounds of a car engine. 

- There's really no sense of speed in the game and I blame that on the race tracks mostly. They're very unmemorable. A lot of these tracks from what I've noticed have a lot of sharp corners and it's annoying because it just slows you down to a crawl. I'm not saying having that is a bad thing particularly but when you get tracks that are sharp corners after sharp corners it's just boring at that point.",0
7477,"I've been playing the game for a bit now. There is no in between of yes or no button, so I voted no. While the gameplay is very nice, and the game overall is quite good. Then there is the auction house...

The auction house system is absolutely terrible. The end time for an auction doesn't extend when a bid is added. This results in people auctioning off their car for low prices in getting shit return on their cars. Not because nobody wants to bid, but because they get ""Bid failed. Please try again"". This seems to be because the client is very slow with updating the latest bids. This could all be solved by extending the bidding timeout by a minute if the last registered bid was less than a minute ago. The way this works right now, people that are lucky will flip these cheap cars for way more, and not because they know the prices better than anybody else, solely just because the auction system is terrible.

Aside from the auction house, I would definitely recommend the game. However I've personally found making money to be hard in these games. I remember the previous one. I was lucky and found a car that could be flipped for way more on the auction house (that worked well in FH3), and repeated that. Naturally I'm doing the same in FH4.",0

7480,"AMAZINGLY OPTIMISED OPEN WORLD RACING GAME

THE PRICING IS ALSO SUPER AMAZING 

ALTHOUGH THE GAME'S BEEN OUT FOR 2+ YEARS BUT ITS STILL FUN TO PLAY AND YOU CAN FIND A LOT OF CONCURRENT ONLINE PLAYERS

Edit : I recently saw lots of people reviewing the game as ""OVERPRICED"". After checking worldwide prices, i came to know that US UK has the game priced at 60 dollar/pounds for standard edition whereas in INDIA (from where i am), the game costs merely 34 dollar for ULTIMATE EDITION. At this price point, a 2 year old game still holds pretty sweet for the money but i will definitely not recommend buying the game at ridiculous prices now. FH5 is likely to launch in late 2021 or early 2022 and will definitely be of same price so its better to save for that game rather than this.

I have been grinding my ass off in this game since its release on the night of 9th march (roughly 12.5 days passed) and i already have 294 cars, 13 million cash.... (simple meaning to say, cars and cash are not a big issue in this game).... just have a few friends to play with regular else the game will become kinda boring... i am already assuming that FH5 will be released in less than a year now so squeeze the maximum fun out of the game as quick as possible....",1

7526,"MANDATORY ADDS!!!!! Just an FYI before you ""BUY"" this game there are mandatory adds about 30 seconds to a minute long. You cannot skip or do anything. The adds are to push their in game content and car packs and what not. Personally the company should go bankrupt for making you watch adds even though you literally purchased the game. NOW the game otherwise is fantastic fun mechanics fun races and beautiful cars. Although I cannot recommend a game that makes you watch adds after you purchase.",0

7594,Forza Horizon 4 is just okay. If you dont have another arcade racing game available to play then go ahead and pick this up otherwise this game just misses the mark. You will try to play the game as an arcade racing game but FH4 game physics will soon get on your nerves. Please do not play this game if you think you're getting a sim racer.

7633,"The driving in this game is pretty awesome.

EVERYTHING else is awful.

You know what we didn't need? A story to a racing game. There are many ""characters"", none of which have any personality, meaning, or purpose. 

You know what we REALLY didn't need? Forced ""cinematics"" and conversations with all of these meaningless people after EVERYTHING that you do. Oh you finished a race? Well now someone is going to force you to the map, force you to listen to a minute long one sided conversation, force you to make a map marker, and then finally leave you alone. 

Also the whole UI of the pause menu is awful, and I'm not a fan of every game thinking it has to be fortnite and letting you play dress-up and having a bunch of ""dances"". 

I have mixed feelings about this game. Probably wouldn't recommend it unless it was on sale, but even then, I would probably suggest getting the last Forza game, or just a different racing game altogether.",0

- Tons of content for the price, especially when purchase Ultimate for discount;
- Seasons

- Basically, it's a car porn

CONS
-Microsoft game. 
It's one and only problem with that. I'm writing this review after being pissed of that my last 2 hours of playtime are not saved for no reason: I finished Spring event, spent some time in a freeroam, and quit from the menu. Imagine how good it feels to realize that your progress is not saved, even tho both steam and MS store triggered some achievements during those 2 hours.

What it does is an illusion, simulation of online experience. Drivatars, Head-to-Heads, leaderbords... but in reality, ""online"" is a mix of simultaneously connected local machines. You can disconnect yourself and play offline - and this opens the gates for many issues. First of all, such sync issues as described above. Cheaters with insane speed/jump/drift records in leaderboards.

I recommend this game only if you love to chill sometimes in a race and not a completionist like me. I really got angry about this game

Also I have tried connecting a steering wheel with this game and it doesn't respond to the peddles and very crap steering, you would think a game like this would be better compatible with a steering wheel as it IS a racing game.  I have to turn the wheel at least 90 degrees just for a VERY shallow turn. and I know it is not the lag causing it's steering to be weak  I know it is not the steering wheel as it responds ok with euro truck simulator 2, but I was hoping for more realistic steering and the ability to apply gears.

The game even after being out for several years, does not support multiple USB connected devices. Meaning you cannot use a shifter or pedals that are not directly connected to your wheel. 

After hours of research trying to get the game to work the only thing that I could find didn‚Äôt even help with the steam version of the game and only applied if you bought it off of the Microsoft store.
 Even if you bought it off of the Microsoft store you have to completely overhaul all of the preset codeing files on your own just to be able to use multiple USB connected devices. 

This is absolutely ridiculous for a main stream title when other games like Project Cars, Assetto Corsa, Gran Turismo, and rFactor all have the capability of running multiple USB connected devices. 

As for the gameplay itself I have no clue if it is good because I wasn‚Äôt even able to use my paddles or get any driving done in the game.

I really like the game, but until they fix the multi controller issues on the Steam version I'll give this a thumb down.
Right now I'm forced to play this game with a XBox controller because the game doesn't recognize my wheel and Fanatec pedals or H-Shifter. Even with the gamepad it is a lot of fun and the cars are very good to control with it. However, it would be so much more with a wheel, clutch and h-shifter!
Also there are an enormous amount of micro stutters in the Steam version.
Fix it already!

Everyone having this problem should thumb this game down until they finally fix it.",0
7757,"I love this game and I have played it before using gamepass on the microsoft store, but ever since I bought the steam version, the game has been crashing non-stop no matter what I do. Specifically, when I get near mission markers, my game would just crash. I have tried clearing up RAM, closing outside applications, turning the graphics down, verifying my files, limiting my fps and using the benchmark mode in game, but I just cannot find a solution.
Edit: After reinstalling, it is working fine again. I just hope it continues this way and that no one else has these issues.",1

7778,"Paid full price for the game? Too bad, 1 minute long unskippable ads for the dlc. 
Trying to cruise around? Too bad, a random npc in the game needs to talk you, sit still and wait.
Trying to quit the game? Popup after popup after popup before you can finally hit the quit button. 
Trying to buy a car? Too bad, to buy this car you need the dlc, $10 to have the ability to buy the car. But we will still show you mostly dlc cars in the shop to make browsing as difficult and time consuming as possible. 
Trying to use the map to set a waypoint? Too bad, an npc has a mission for you and it will pan away from your location right away. Good luck figuring out where you are, there is no button to center back on your vehicle after the game takes control of the map. 
Save yourself time and money and don't get this game, your expectations of playing a driving game will be subverted. This is a movie with ads every 20 minutes and the occasional ability to drive your car.",0
7779,"Important:  This game is wonderful and I have almost nothing but good things to say about it.  It was made by people who love cars and it shows in every little in-game detail, from the manual tuning of cars, to the free range of difficulty that suits each individual player's needs, to the inside of the cockpit being painstakingly rendered to look exactly like their real life counterparts (I'm lookin at you, Challenger.)

Here's why I don't recommend this game.

As a user of a Haptic Steering Wheel (Logitech G29), I was surprised to find that the Steam edition does not support it, at least in its current state.  I spent hours trying to find work arounds and to no avail; the game doesn't even recognize there's a steering wheel being used.

I refunded the game from Steam once I had given up.

I bought this on the store in which it was originally released, loaded it up, and right away the game knew what my steering wheel was and how to program it.

Something was lost in the transition from the original release-store to Steam, so they lost my dollar.  Unfortunate, since I like having all my games in one place, but what are you going to do?

I'll say this.  This game is lovely.  A treat for the eyes.  It's a must have for car-lovers and racing fans, and I'd call it ""The Bar"".  The cars have competitive graphics, it supports 144hz, and you're looking at a multi-event style open world racer rpg with free-tuned cars and custom graphics that functions almost like Burnout Paradise City did, where you drive to events at your leisure in between hunting for secret stuff and taking screenshots of your beast.  

My only real complaint is the strange avatar system.  Human character models were obviously not designed with any finesse, and that's generally not a big deal for this game.  But there isn't a character editor; just a weird ""select a mannequin"" feature where you pick some lifeless uncanny-valley avatar which, in most cases I'd imagine, is supposed to represent you to some degree.  Men with short/no hair or facial hair will be disappointed. At least you can dress them.  Sort of.

And for anyone who's complaining that this game is still full price, you're cringe.  It's two and a half years old.  There's literally a ton of +3 year old games that are still full price.  Work a couple hours of overtime and you can afford a new game.",0

Also, the force feedback feels incredibly wrong in this version as well, like it's inverted or something and you cannot change it no matter what you do in the settings. If you don't believe me, just Google the topic, you will thank me later. And if you think support of either party will ""support"" you with this issue, well, spoiler: they don't care because Horizon 5 is topping their money charts.

This game thrives on stupid prize wheels in order to make any money. what are the prizes? you could get $200,000 or a pair of pink slippers. more than likely you will get low prizes like $5,000 to $15,000. 
loading screens are just advertising more of their own products.
Do not expect to make any sort of decent money racing, you probably will make $20,000 a race. Unless its a drag race, then you get like $700 for first place. 
Car customization is awful, it has the worst customization I have ever seen in a racing game. customizing is barely better than need for speed hot pursuit 2 (NFS HP2 you only get to pick a color before the race). There are like two different types of wings/spoilers (if your lucky) and it will be the exact same on every car in that class. you will probably at most have 1 bumper option which is the same on EVERY car in the game, canards and a red hook...
Tuning makes no sense and shows how little the developers actually know about vehicles. For example the ford mustang GT in the game is slower than the real life version and does NOT have the same gear ratio as the real life version. if you ""tune"" the ratio to Fords real ratio the car becomes slower... also a lower gear ratio will increase low end torque and acceleration, but why does doing this decrease the cars acceleration in the game? doesn't make sense, But lets say you reverse it and give a higher gear ratio the car will also have slower acceleration but it will actually increase top speed (which is actually 1 in the game) Whats also confusing is how I can buy a car (a sports car) and it will have a 200+ foot braking distance. SOMETIMES you can tune the brakes and get it down to around a 130 foot brake distance BUT, that is still AWFUL. I drive a Ford Explorer ST and it has a 60-0 brake distance of 114 feet. again this is an example of the ignorance of the game developers. 
Cars don't sound great honestly.
This game has a lot of content but I have found my self bored far to quickly just because I think the quality is sub par and not entertaining.

I would suggest need for speed heat, its put together better. cars sound more realistic, modifications are better, driving is better, sounds better, and there's greater sense of speed and aggression in the game. Unlike forza in NFS heat you can customize exhaust note, modify headlights, tail lights, install under glow (if you are into that) and more.

7881,"It's meh.

Positives include (and are pretty much limited to): A vast selection of wonderfully detailed cars. Good graphics. Drifting is fun.

Negatives: Boring map, meh car physics, terrible engine sounds, obnoxious UI, insulting unskippable ads for the DLC, modding options that don't really do much for the dynamics of the car beyond better/worse, love it or hate it music (most likely hate it), irritating slow map reveals every time you go into it, stupid car acquisition system that takes all the fun and excitement out of earning new vehicles (but as a plus does make it easy to get whatever car you want) and not enough Toyotas. 

Okay, the last point speaks to my ""fanboyism"" more than anything else, but still ... not enough Toyotas.

If the appeal of ""a vast selection of wonderfully detailed cars"" is not lost on you, this game may yet have some entertainment value. As, admittedly, it does for me. However, the game behind that is unfortunately not particularly good. At best it could be described as an inoffensive racing game trapped behind a highly abrasive user experience.

Yes, it's gigantic, open world, tons of things to do, 450 something cars to collect, fine tune (so to speak), create or download custom liveries for, go completely bonkers in with no concern for damage to your rig or harm to others. Online functionality keeps things lively, at least in an artificial sense until you specifically try to match up for individual competitions.

*Cons*
Music is absolute cancer and severely limited, and there‚Äôs no way to apparently even mute it at an options level. Just make it quiet at 1/10 setting. You have to turn off the radio all the time over and over. So have fun trying to play your own music. That'll get annoying. And if you do, you will still be missing out on DJ commentary that‚Äôs related to what you've done. Apparently prior games allowed custom music but this one did away with it.

The game does run great but the visuals, and I truly mean everything your eyes will take in, feel .... like plastic. This game is plastic. It‚Äôs a shiny-happy-people, AI-designed, nerf padded, fuckoff ball pit of a game. The car models are good but the world feels like a bucket of public domain assets that got bathed in modern post processing. 

And then there is all the voice acting. The entire cast of actors are snorting adderall before and after their individual lobotomies, because not one of them has a personality. Coated with sanitizer. No souls. Aural equivalent of gingers, everywhere. They make noises with their mouths but they say nothing of value. It's maddening to listen to these people talk. I'm losing my own contact with the earth realm as I play this game. Is this the extent of humanity? I know I once played games where people could act out a range of emotions, but they are a distant memory now. I only know to‚Ä¶.drive, and to‚Ä¶be stoked. I‚Ä¶.I must‚Ä¶resist‚Ä¶.The only other character in any other video game in my entire life‚Äôs experience that resembles what you‚Äôll find in Forza Horizon 4 is perhaps this good wholesome boy from Dragon Age: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SnGqeVoUBnM

I don‚Äôt really know where to go from here. I will keep playing. I know I wont get my money‚Äôs worth. Ultimate edition should be $30 max, base game should be $20 max. If you want a racer and you don‚Äôt care about open world, you could do better with countless other titles, especially from Codemasters. If you DO want open world and Steam is your platform, well I guess this is the best.

Play this for the car modeling. Inside and outside. Very nice dash cams which is a rarity these days. The car modeling is obviously where all the effort went. Just dont expect anything to drive realistically. This is the most arcade-y of arcade racers ever concocted by man. Everything is on ice skates. Every object you hit is made of paper mache, except the objects made of adamantium. Good luck figuring out which is which.",0

7923,"I've had this game for many months....probably over a year. Hell...FH 5 is now out. And I see that FH 4 got a GOLD award in the Steam awards for 2021 games. Really? 

So this is the 4th version of this game I've purchased, I guess. I've been playing since the first one and IMHO, that was by far, the best. All the others have become bloated with all sorts of garbage that many people don't care about. I just want to race, look for barn finds and race again. All that other stuff is annoying. 

For instance.....
I just finished a race in FH 5...a point to point race. I won but I hit many obstacles....fences, poles, stone walls and then a pack of chickens. NOTHING slowed me down. Dumb. I would MUCH RATHER have car damage be more realistic than spending resources on chickens running across the road. Simply stupid. Go play WreckFest to see how somewhat realistic car damage works. I'd pay extra for that. 

And now.....after not playing this game for many months because it's freaking boring, I try to play and some stupid *ss narrator dude is telling me what keypad buttons I'm pressing! WTH? And why? OK...I understand that it's an option, but why make it the default. It took me hours of searching online to figure out how to stop it and I have to do that EVERYTIME I start the damn game. Again...stupid.

And....now.....I keep getting a notification that I can't connect to some server! What? So...I hit the X button to 'retry' and it connects and then 5 minutes later, same damn thing. So I quit and look at the discussions here on Steam and finally find one that says I have to go into my PC settings and make another change there. OMG. 

Maybe, just maybe, if the game was really good, all this annoying stuff might be worth the trouble. But it isn't. 
I'll go back to playing WreckFest, a game I paid for one time and they just keep making it better and better. 

Will I still play this game? Oh, probably...after several months when I see it in my library and will have forgotten how boring it is.

Still, it's such a crappy system that you have to do soo much stupid stuff just to play this game, and don't let me get started on the constant stuttering, fps drops, especially during loading and cutscenes, and the crashes. 

In summary, FH4 is an amazing work of art but this version (the steam port) is poorly ported, I hope Turn10 or PG will fix this shortly in the upcoming updates.

Now as I have played a lots of hours I have noticed that even though I have gtx 1650 graphics card(laptop version) I am getting 97 max and 77 low fps in high settings according to the game but sometimes the frames drop to 17,27 for seconds then again it rises, I don't know why?!
And also the game crashed one time and stopped for only one time till now, let's see microsoft will fix this or not, who knows ü§î
ANOTHER BIG THING IS THAT WHEN YOU OPEN THE GAME YOU CAN'T HEAR A THING IN BETWEEN AFTER THE METER IS SHOWN AND THE THEME MUSIC AGAIN MICROSOFT HAVE TO FIX THAT ALSO.

You cant use any vehicle you want because there's restrictions in class and type that you have no idea what they are until you've joined. I just want to be able to join an infected round with whatever vehicle I want and have a good time but no. If theirs a way to do this I haven't found it yet. The game sure as shit isn't telling me and there's little to no information about it that I can find online.

So many cheaters and rammers. Rammers are easy to deal with and cheaters require a screen record to report on the website. Most cheaters are using WeMod's ""fast accel"" cheat which sets your traction coefficient to 1.0 (vs what your car normally has, usually under 0.5) (I know bc I've used it in the past and was banned for it) or the ""speed boost"" cheat which literally doubles your speed.

But, worse than the cheaters and rammers, is the FUCKING MATCHMAKING. Sit on a loading screen or lobby for 30+ minutes only for it to be the last race because the game uses a mesh network and every time someone quits or joins it has to rebuild the entire mesh between each player. If someone is in China you can bet your ass you're never seeing a race.

The game will also load you into the last of 3 races so it won't matter if you win or lose, just a huge ass waste of time.

7947,"Honestly, the gameplay is fine but I have some major gripes in relation to the practices of this game. Firstly, the DLC. There is an ungodly amount of DLC in this game, especially in relation to new cars, however this seems both highly unnecessary, and cash grab-y. Secondly, this game features in game ads. Specifically during loading screen which I don't have a big problem with, but also after you qualify for certain in game events, it will play an unskipable, baked in ad for one of their lego DLCs, and the 007 car. Finally, and most importantly, this game is as we know the fourth installation. I previously had Forza Horizon 2 a while ago, and I was looking to play that game again, However, it is virtually unpurchasable, except for getting a disc version of the game for a console. This was incredible angering to learn, and I was quite annoyed. I also found that Forza Horizon 1, and 3 are not purchasable either. This irked me, as I wanted to get my fill without paying 80$ for the new Horizon 5. Eventually I was able to pick this game up on sale. But that leaves a very important fact that Playground Games, and by extension Microsoft don't care about these games or their users at all. They instead bank on the fact that they can kill of their earlier games in order to force people to buy the newer, more expensive games. Buying one of these games immediately puts your experience on a timer. Eventually, when Microsoft deems it a waste, they will simply kill off the game. And sure, you may be able to play it still, but with a less active userbase, and potentially no online functionality. It's such an obvious scheme to get users to buy multiple versions, similar to sports games. It's definitely not a business practice I want to support in the slightest. 

On the flip side, I enjoy how the game plays out, lots of customization, and settings to mess around with. Online racing is very fun, and feels well executed (as one would expect from a triple A title). Some of the features seem a bit dumb to me personally, such as dances you can equip after you win a race, but to each their own. I have enjoyed speccing out different cars for different purposes as well, such as drifting, street racing, cruising, etc. It feels very satisfying to nail down the tuning of vehicles to perfectly suit the needs. 

Overall, I would say that you should not purchase this game, unless you look to play it offline. The singleplayer experience will remain untouched by the devs for these games, but you got maybe a couple years of fun online left, not worth it in the slightest for that aspect.",0

Crashes HARD after latest ""Stability update"" Yeah.. rrright.  
Played it for a ccouple of hours before the 'Stability Update""*Scoff*  but suffers from about everything in older NFS games: Rubberbanding Ai, Ai that 'suddenly' gets turbo boost and wheels made of sticky tape. Also super annoying locking of cars in the beginning ,despite having a perfectly capable rally car in the beginning.. once making the mistake of trying another vehicle, You're stuck with that choice until 'Autumn events' Oh.. and saves disappear, crashes to desktop, stutters. For a 2 year old game quite shameful for this price. Wait for a sale ( if ever) 

Much better with friends. Ai is v√©ry unfairly biased. Still cannot corner..  compensated by suddenly becoming like on rails.. odd sight.

Landscapes are beautifully done, no complaints there, but the rest.. ehm.. yeah.. well..  If You're into bombing around in pretty cars that are rendered quite well, go ahead, but don't expect to get to them too quickly. There's an annoying grind ( and CTD's) waiting.

I'll make it short.

PROS and CONS listed.

PROS
----------
-Beautiful graphics
-Realistic car physics
-+400 cars,common,rare,legendary,etc 
  sports cars,hyper cars,classic car,rally cars,buggies,etc
-Nice music.
-Spring,Summer,Autumn,Winter.
-Tons of content,events,rewards .
-Breathtaking Britain,with interesting DLC maps.
-Great multiplayer integration.
-runs great on controller.
-Well optimized graphics.

CONS
-------------
-Terrible port to steam because its stuttering but it got fixed with a 500mb update which i received after a day or two in my case.
 This is a big issue on steam version and the update is no guarantee will fix stutter for your rig.So i'll say its 50/50.Either take the risk or get it from MS store.You can always refund if it fails.Just remember before 14 days and not more than 2 hours gameplay.
-Car engine sound could be better,but obviously,the pros outweight the cons here.
-Story is meh....basically, no campaign or continuing story,just different types of mini stories abt cars,etc.....but,considering the gameplay is good,its negligable

CONCLUSION
----------------------
Coming from NFS to FORZA for the first time, I MUST SAY THIS IS A MUST PLAY  for all avid racers out there.
Game is extremely personalized and catered towards individual progress,very rewarding game.
+100 of hours fun,cant get bored of it.
Seriously,lighting looks so good in this game,the cars,trees,roads,streetlight,skies,entire Britain looks so alive.

7998,"This game is absolute trash arcade physics game, mad and graphics are good, tuning is really bad and low variety of parts you can change. 1. person view will make you puke, hands look like LEGO man and steering wheel rotates 90 degrees. If you try to play with your friend, most likely you would spend 7 hours trying to connect to convoy and get 1 and the same network crash, then go to xBox site, see that everything is ok there and you have allowed playing online and stuff and still get 1 and the same error. Idea great but how they made it is absolute trash, not as bad as The Crew 2 but holy, these seasonal races are brain dead. Also i and lot of players hate the super wheel spin, all you get is 1500c or blue clothes/horns. This game could be better, and i thought, that fh5 would improve, but its just different map with HUD and some other cars.....how pathetic. Just buy Assetto Corsa, install mods, get your self Union Island map and you have smaller fh5 that looks and feels so much better",0

8002,"Forza Horizon 4 is a good Arcade racer.
All though the menus seem to be designed by a Savant or Rainman... i just cant wrap my head around the ideology of the menu, why is it so fragmented?? Why are there like 3 different TABS with CAR on it?

Any ways, the game has the option to be a SIM, but it is not. Well the cars will wipe out if you go to fast in a turn. But then again, even the smallest lightest car will crash trough stone walls and trees like the cool aid guy. (paint your car bright green for full on HULK roleplay)

The game plays best with a controller... thats something i would never say for a racing game that has SIM as an option.  I tested my G29 with Shifter and i must say, the thing does not work well if you just plug it in. With the wheel the game feels unresponsive, dull and twitchy. For example tryed to drive my Focus RS on asphalt and with the wheel at 120kmh the car just wipes out on the slightest steering input.

Tested my G29 on Forza Motorsport 7 right after becouse i tought meybe it was a driver problem... it was not, Motorport 7 work perfectly with the wheel from the get go.

The CAR selection in the game is fantastic, allthough some cars can only be obtained if you follow the daily challenges or seasonal events, i think. i still dont get it how seasons change, i guess its on a daily basis?

The CAR COSTUMISATION is kinda ample it's actualy the same thing as in MOTORSPORT 7.

The MAP or location, is kinda boring. It has meybe like 4 different locations that are kinda unique, and the seasons are pointless. The seasons add nothing, it might ass well have been Summer and Winter since autumn and Spring are summer in a different paint.

I dont know, if you want an arcady racer, i guess it's better than the new NFS games...Not bad but strange, very strange...",1

8005,"I've not previously played any of the Horizon series and initially found the game to be a lot of fun, addictive,  looks fantastic, and runs great, but I was disappointed that even when set to 'simulation' the damage physics behaves like an arcade game. You can have head on crashes at 200 mph, drive across lakes and your car just keeps going, you don't even need to bother driving on the roads to get anywhere, you can go everywhere off road.

8023,"Probably or maybe even the best arcade racing game before Forza horizon 5 will release. 

Driving Experience: 
Great driving experience more on the sim type of steering and breaking, makes you enhance your driving skills and choose a perfect racing line even on an arcade game. if you wanna beat the higher difficulty drivatars or online PVP (but good racing line and breaking isn't only what you need in online PVP, more on that on Online Experience) you need to improve your driving skill veteran drivers and high difficulty drivatars are really good in this game.

Customization:
It maybe have the best paint booth but I wish you could edits someones decals and just cant share it, would be better if it has more customization options like add more aftermarket bodykits and wings the ones in the game are a bit boring IMO, Tuning is great but for new players it might be a bit overwhelming tbh.

Online Experience:
Online PVP is garbage for me, out of 10 races you maybe can find 1 race that no driver will torpedo you to the corner everyone out there just wanna put you to the wall, and it doesn't really give you a worthy rewards when ranking up and it isn't really fun because of everyone just wanna body slam their cars to yours, so I dont whats the reason of playing online PVP, but I must say the rankings for Speedtrap, Speedzones, Driftzones and other types of these are pretty entertaining since you can set a record then let your friends try to beat it.

Campaign Experience:
Yeah! very good campaign, it has a variety of racing and stories that will keep you busy for quite a bit of time.

now to Bad: ye game is dirt cheap - since there is 3 big dlc or season pass for second price that won't be. Lootboxes as main way of getting cars, drip feeding ingame currency at snail pace. Daily/weekly/seasonal reward to keep you waiting for new dlc.

JUST. LET. ME. DRIVE!!!    For Pete's Sake, STOP with the childish  storylines , the pseudo rpg characterization, the glamorization of illegal street racing.... the list goes on, but you know what really ruined it for me? The cutscenes. You know, the ones where you are forced to sit through line after line after line after line after line after line after line after line after line after line after line after line after line after line of childish dialog?  I don't care. I just want to race. If you just want to race, this is not for you, believe me.
Horrid handling right from the start. Cars 1 and 2  drove, felt,  and sounded like total garbage right from the start.  NPC cars heavily buffed compared to yours, simply to add grind. That tired old trope from NFS has just got to DIE dammit.None of the arcade feel of speed..... wasn't looking for a simulator, so I guess i was looking for fast action but I didn't find it in the first couple of races. and I bailed out of boredom.  I just want to race, I don't want to get involved in an UNSKIPPABLE janky cringefest of  vignettes about a cartoon protagonist.  It's a fairly pretty but sort of sterile open world, but just doesn't feel right to me. Tried it for a couple of sessions, each one ending with me just not having any fun.  Tons of rave reviews, so obviously I'm in the minority, but in my opinion this is for the 10-14 crowd. There are some great options for  car tuning, maybe the best setup for that I've seen in years, but it never translated into a real feeling of accomplishment or wonder on the actual tracks.  I paid $26 for Forza 4 and I personally don't think it was worth it. Couldn't bring myself to play any longer than about 60 minutes each session.",0

I generally dislike & avoid this genre, but the driving physics and sheer amount of customization have me hooked; there are so many cars and customization options that the game is almost as much about collecting & tuning cars as it is about racing them. There are a ton of difficulty options and you can generally make the game as easy or difficult as you like. I recommend playing with an Xbox One controller as the driving is designed around it, but you can play the game with pretty much anything (kb+m, gamepad, wheel, etc.)

Unfortunately, this port is kinda shit. It runs worse than the Microsoft Store version and crashes constantly. The developers appear to be aware of this & are addressing it in patches, but it's been a month and stability is still rocky - ever since yesterday's update I haven't been able to play for more than 30 minutes without the game crashing.

8086,"TL;DR: One of the worst racing games I've played besides The Crew 2. Controls are bad. AI is bad. VA is bad. It's all bad man.

Grand Theft Auto V has more extensive car-customization options than Forza. The most you can do is increase performance, and add the same stupid spoiler kit to every car. Very few cars have options beyond that. The most extensive part of customizing your car is the vinyl/sticker system.

The UX/UI is trash. Absolute garbage. Almost 70 hours in and I still can't find where some things are in the fucking menus. Every option is nested in a box, 90% of the boxes are the same size/shape. It is awful to navigate. Everything takes 3 minutes longer than it needs to.

Cars and their reflections like nice on max settings, but it's hard to fuck that up considering most of the cars are scanned-in anyhow.

The AI is supposedly based on other racers, which IMO is a cop-out on the developer's part. Maxing out the difficulty will get you strong-armed off track, and leaving it on average lowers the potential credit you can make in a race. Regardless of difficulty AI seems to always have an advantage, hitting another racer at the beginning of a race will cause the car in 1st to have a massive gap, racing clean will often get you PITed off-track by the AI. It sucks.

This is one of the worst racing games I've ever played. The only thing that kept me playing was a desire to unlock every house, and the fastest car. One of which is a castle that costs over 10m, as soon as you buy it a voice-over tells you that you don't really own it, but are apparently more of a caretaker. Very unsatisfying and anticlimactic.

Shitty, un-skippable voice overs constantly remind you how much other pointless shit there is to do in the game.",0

I would say though at some point in the beginning you will feel overwhelmed by the amount of information thrown at you, so take your time with it.

TL;DR developers should take this game as a basis of how to make a racing game.",1

Ingredients:

1. 6 tablespoons unsalted butter
2. 1/2 cup white sugar
3. 1/2 cup brown sugar
4. 1/4 cup water
5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon
6. 1 pinch salt
7. 5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced
8. 1 pastry for double-crust pie

Directions:

1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.
3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.
4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.
5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.
6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing.",1

Steering wheel wouldn't work (Logitech MOMO) even though I spent about an hour trying all sorts of things that I shouldn't have had to try (all other driving games I own work with the MOMO wheel with zero issues). I returned the game.,0
8131,"Pros: 
+ Lots of cars.
+ Nice music (I liked Young Ejecta ‚Äî Build a Fire, Anna Yvette ‚Äî Shooting Star).
+ Stunning visuals.  

Cons: 
- Lots of cars is also part of cons, because I struggled to find needed car and it's hard even to try all of them. All cars are like few car physics models with slightly different settings. Real differences are in 3D models and engine sounds. 
- I hated drift zones, but managed to finish all of them by 3 stars after hours trying. Some on tuned Civic (this is the only drifting car that was fun to play), because Formula Drift cars are abysmal plops of poo. This game would be better without drifting at all.
- User made ""Super-7"" contests are mostly stupid.
- Cheaters filled user rankings with speeds over 500 kph, and even if game was fixed, rankings left as were before fixes.
- Not convenient car tuning. For some cars RPM/Torque table is not exist at all. 

And since I've finished every stunt in game, my interest suddenly vanished, before I even won a single Horizon pass point.

I can recommend this game if you want to play laying on sofa with a controller or a keyboard. This is hardly a real sim, despite it has tuning.

You can collect cars and clothing but seriously, wrapping racing game about collecting crap is stupid. I feel like this is main game loop and racing is just meaning to collect all hats and cars.

Would recommend saving your money and get Project Cars 3 instead if you want a decent racing game.

Speaking of control, don't even try to use a wheel, heavens above. The physics are for ****. I managed 66 minutes and every second was infuriating.

I love racing circuit in real life and off-roading. This game is not realistic in its handling or physics. Not to mention the shitty toxic community that just rams you off the road with a multi million dollar car with no penalty bc it's just a game. If you want REAL racing avoid this game everything about it is fake in even full pro mode tire wear is basic,clutch and gear shift is okay I suppose, it's just a open world Need for Speed honestly.

8199,"So i bought the g920 wheel only for this game becouse it was coming to steam and could not wait to play it so i bought the wheel waited patiently for the 9th and BOOM Wheel feel and set up is so garbage it doesnt feel whatsoever even close to real driving , 10 times cheaper games have got 100 % better actual simulation of the driving sensation , im not a big critic and dont make reviews usually but this is so bad dont make the mistake of actually giving those cheap devs any money. And the most confusing thing of all is that the cockpit view steering animation when you have a 900 steering degree on your wheel the animation of your caracter goes only 180 degrees for such a huge budget game they couldnt afford to do a simple normal steering animation. For controller or keyboard people yeah sure go ahead but for players who want to have a real racing feel on the equipment they spent hundrets of dollars on just dont. If you havent driven a car in real life you probably will adapt to it. In my free time i drive my modded honda prelude with 400HP on race tracks an can tell you i do not expect the most realistic feel from this game but my god i cannot get over how horrible it is. If i play it for one week straight and go to the real life racing track i will probably crash on the first bend i swear its so bad it might cause real drivers to crash if they play it too much. This is just my honest opinion go buy the game and if you are after realism go feel it and u will be spamming the refund button in 30 mins .",0

What's that? You have a Jaguar Project 7? Wel sure, physics is just a figment of your imagination. Wheelspin all the way at 3500rpm in 1st gear at 20Km/h. Fuck logic eh?
The '84 Mini best known for it's nippy go-kart like handling? Well fuck that, it will now drift at 60Km/h! What's that? It's a Frontwheel drive car? lol Here's a new hat. hurr durr.
Online gameplay? You mean 6v6 at the beginning and then when people leave you never get balanced teams again? Fuck sure let's just add insult to injury and make it that the scoring system stays the same making it IMPOSSIBLE to beat the enemy. Eyup... you can have your team of 2v6 be in first and second, but the enemy will still get more points anyway for just finishing.

Playground Games and Microsoft really fucked this one. There is some fun to be had, but if you take in ALL of the game and what you are meant to do... it's just shit. 
On a PS4 controller you can stand still on a flat piece of road and be in 1st gear... lightly pull the right trigger for gas and you will go BACKWARDS. In 1st gear.
Playground games have no idea how cars work. They can make them look pretty, but that's about it.

TL;DR
It's a slotmachine game that pays you in outfits you see during the TERRIBLE loading screens. It has horrible online components and constant network stuttering that feel tacked on as an afterthought. There are some aspects that you might enjoy but as a whole the game is terribly coded and spits in the face of racing fans with the sheer lack of customisation they COULD have had for cars if they didn't use that time making cosmetics.",0

8218,"After playing this game long enough to get almost all of the cars, every home bought, almost all of the racing (, & other) events finished, I can say don't buy this game... the game controls like driving on ice, their' (the Eastern European developers Bill Gates have make these games because He's already got every American dev hating Him, AND Microsoft) idea of drifting is sliding in a STRAIGHT line, right off the road, even in drift cars You have to slow down to a crawl to even GET it to drift without sliding. If You set ALL of the driving help ""difficulty"" settings to easiest is what I'm talking about too! If You set the difficulty to the hardest settings every vehicle is undrivable except in whatever straight line You're aiming in... The exact same ""SIM"" physics (which REALLY mean devs that've NEVER driven fast, drifted, or even done doughnuts in'a sportscar, much less hypercar setup the game to torture You with slamming on the brakes, then having to ""feather"" the gas/brake until it stops trying to lock up the brakes, & will turn the turns)... If REAL car's brakes locked up like this there'd be a car crash every 0.0000001 seconds. Games are supposed to be ""FUN"", as in I should be able to drive WAY better, & faster in a video game then I can in real life, only insane people wanna be a scrub in games, & I'm NOT one of them.

       NOW that being said, this game DOES have a few things going for it... #1 lots of cars, trucks, buggies, vans, tiny 3 wheeled ""smart cars"" (which go faster then almost anything on the game once maxed out...), etc. #2 You can put 6,000 decals on Your' car, on every car 6k, You can make, then save Your' stickers to use later (like on the Crew-2), AND even upload/download stickers to share... (See My screenshots for examples of what You can make a car look like on here), #3 You can sell/buy cars either stock, or already setup in any/every possible way including body, wheels, stickers etc. in the auction house. #4 the graphics are awesome, AND the game runs quite smoothly/well OFFLINE in single player mode.

HOWEVER!...

        The game has quite a few negatives going against it. #1 the servers have always been TERRIBLY laggy, WHEN they let You connect at all (I played the game online for months, THEN after an update that was supposed to FIX the lag, I haven't been able to connect since, which means no sharing stickers, no buying/selling cars, no multiplayer functionality what-so-ever, & it's been this way for almost 4 months [Today is 9-12-21]), #2 as I stated above the game is programmed by people who drive on the LEFT side of the road, so expect to HATE driving around dodging traffic, whilst feeling disorientated because of being on the WRONG side of the road! #3 as I said above ALL of the vehicles control as badly as possible, in EVERY situation. #4 the A.I. drivers You'll be racing against (since the game will never let You connect to the server) are all ""ringers"", as in they will ALWAYS make it around every turn as if their' physics are setup like'a racing game SHOULD be setup, while You fly off of the road, or bounce off the walls, every time, every race... You'll find Yourself trying to use LOWER power score setups, & Your' own ""ringer"" cars to even come in first most'a the time, in MOST modes. #5 a great deal of the signs You're meant to smash, scattered around the maps, are on TOP of buildings, or other places where You can ONLY reach them during an event (, but You'll have no idea WHICH event it is per sign), OR (even worse) during the times online that certain tasks (like who can jump the farthest, or get the highest drift/speed score, etc.) show up periodically, & for a VERY limited time ONLY. Which means ""IF"" You cannot connect to their' awful servers (, & You won't, go read the forums about other player's connectivity issues), then You cannot even get 100% of everything done, which I know lots of players like to do.

Summed up... I heard for YEARS on social networking, & in game chat on racing games that Forza games were/are ""better then Gran Tourismo"", ""the best racing games everrr"", etc. & they're FAR from it. If You only want to do the fairly easy offroad events, & make lots'a cool lookin' cars with the ridiculous ability to place 6,000 stickers on each car, then maybe buy it on sale, if You like racing games that drive as good, or better then REAL cars do, or want to drive on the correct side of the road, or want to actually connect to multiplayer... then buy Need for speed-Heat.",0

8223,"Bottom line, Forza Horizon 4 is one of the greatest arcade, open-world racing games of all time...if you can run it.  It has sublime graphics, bolstered by a peppy and fun soundtrack, a gaggle of modes, all nested within a massive and lovingly crafted world.  I played the game for almost 75 hours on Windows 10 and enjoyed it thoroughly.  The game is extremely optimized and I was running the title at 4K, Ultra @ 60 fps, with no issues.

When I moved to Windows Server 2019/Windows 10 LTSC (for work), the Microsoft Store version of the game stopped working due to a reliance on the Microsoft Store software (which is impossible to add, even with PowerShell).  I was overjoyed to find out the game was coming to Steam.  To date, the Steam Store page lists Windows 1703 as a requirement for Forza Horizon 4.  Because Windows 10, Windows LTSC and Windows Server 2019 all share the same codebase versions (including kernel versions), I was hoping to be able to run the game.

Despite running other titles like GTA V, Red Dead Redemption 2, Gears of War 4 and 5, State of Decay 2, Metro Exodus, Resident Evil 2, 3 and Village, Doom 2016, Doom Eternal, Warhammer 40,000 BattleSector, Apex Legends, Call of Duty Warzone, Back 4 Blood and dozens of other titles, this game won't run...at all.  The game  relies on the Windows Store for all of its updates, achievements and ID mechanics, despite having access to Steam's own platform.  All this junk runs in the background, resulting in this game running between 5-10 fps slower than the Widows Store version (verified on Youtube).

Now, almost a year later, the developers, Playground Games, and the porting team both have stayed quiet on that reliance on the Windows Store.  That reliance is crucial because it makes the game almost impossible to run on Valve's Mac CrossOver compatibility layer for Mac Steam, as well as Valve's SteamOS/Linux Proton compatibility layer for Linux Steam as well(you know, the same technology used on the Steam Deck!  No one uses Linux! /s).  With no news from the developers, nor the support teams on Steam, the forums are riddled with replies by technical troglodytes/trolls that caustically make themselves nuisances to anyone that challenges the technical inadequacy of the port.

Bottom line, Forza Horizon 4 won't work for 10% of the PC population, due to a simple script that they refuse to pump a few man hours into, in order to fix.  They also refuse to address the issue.  What they don't refuse to do, is regulate posters on their forums that ask tough questions.  They also don't refuse to stop the the borderline criminal faulty advertisement on their Steam Store page where the game is misrepresented as running on Windows installations that it simply will never run on.

If you're a Windows 10 user playing a game on a self-built system and you like racing games, it might be worth your time.  However, lots of racing games are excellent examples of the genre, and I don't believe that Playground/Microsoft should be rewarded for this shameful behavior.  Focus your attentions elsewhere.  If you're a Server, Windows 10 LTSC, Windows 8, Windows 7, Mac or Linux user, avoid this game like the plague.  The port job is done by amateurs and the community is infested with tools that will only waste your time.

Lowest possible recommendation.

My son got this game for Christmas from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just, watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. loaded into the game, made my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. loved it as it was the best time had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well.

- it's a very beautiful game BUT you must learn and study things about cars and then about tuning system in this game. why? because the default mechanism will give a bad experience.  I'm still learning tuning system actually. 

- I've played many racing games and they all have slippery cars including this except for Grid 2 and NFS BE 2005 and payback. I can't feel the stability of the car. 

- the only game that make me feel the speed is NFS BE 2005. but this game and other games, the speed is already 140 km but it feels like 60 km in real life. but according to game mechanism, it's 140. really annoying things specially when it comes to corners.

8303,"This game saved my life. 

I am 31.
I am playing this game from Torrent since I can't afford it before the Black Friday sale, now I can!
My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and adopted our son together. They are now both 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I found myself lost and miserable. I was self destructive. I got so mad one day from everything spiraling out of my control that I punched some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion. That caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand... my working hand... my games hand.. the hand that I held and carried my children to bed with.. The hand I desperately needed to make sure I could continue to provide.

After learning of the severity of my self-inflicted damage, I was borderline suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety. I have never had fits of rage, or been one to break down and cry, but I was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side.

Having nothing better to do, I searched for a game I could play, ONE HANDED while I recovered. I somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews. I decided that it had to be worth a shot... I must admit, I didn't beat the game, or play nearly as long as some of you. In fact, I may have only played this game a day or two.. With that being said, after doing so, I had a new found joy and hope for life. I was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me. I was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness. I was able to see the fruits of my ""labor"". I relaxed for 5 minutes to this music long enough to realize that I was going to be okay.
After coming to that realization, I turned the game off, and I went back to work. It hurt my hand like hell but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself, and I became the father I needed to be in that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving as.

Today, I am close friend with my kids mother. We don't fight, or argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents, and friends.

I now have 3 kids. My third child is, wait for it, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my own separation, and we just stumbled in to each others life unexpectedly. We have been in a relationship for a year now, and are very happy together.

Moral of the story, you never know what life holds in store for you, and if I would have given up when all the odds were stacked against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

Thank you!",1

8325,"This game is an easy 10/10 from me, legendary status ""must have / play"" game. 
I've never seen a game more optimized AND beautiful than this one (not steam version). The Windows version is the Golden standard for how games should run. Ultra settings, 8x msaa 3440x1440p easy 60fps, no dips whatsoever.

The gameplay is fun and addicting, though I would like a slower buildup. The graphics are virtually unmatched especially considering how it all works and runs. There are so many cars, so highly detailed and they ALL have a cockpit view, as it should be. The driving physics are the best in the genre (imo). The music is great, it's just a really good game, imo the best open-world racer we have atm.

What I'd like to see in the next installment:
-Propper housing like GTA Online
-Bigger map
-More highways

Racing wise, the feel is arcade like. And as always with this sort of game, apparently the quickest way to go round a corner is power sliding side ways...  Graphics are ok. Its pretty enough. Map size is surprisingly small for all the hype about this game. Again its been surpassed by rivals.

8332,"Forza horizon 5 got announced. Here's what this means:

>If you purchased Forza Horizon 4 Ultimate Edition on Steam, and precisely on Steam, this means you have just been scammed 200$.
>100$ is for the base game, since now that FH5 is a thing, this means FH4 will NEVER get the updates that fix all the crashing, bluescreens, 0xC0000005's, and most of all, MOST OF ALL, the confirmed DDR4 RAM bricking issue.
>Because of the issue above, you have to spend another 100$ buying a new RAM kit. Yes, they're now that expensive thanks to scalpers.
>Steam will obviously refuse to give you a refund because you already spent 30 hours trying to fix the goddamn game since Playground games won't do it themselves.
>Since Steam will refuse to give you a refund, you now are stuck with LITERAL MALWARE inside your library.
>The fact that FH5 got announced also means that Turn 10 and Playground games are working on FH5 and FMR at the SAME TIME.
>This means the quality of both games will be reduced drastically.
>FH5 uses the exact same Forza Vista models and physics that we have seen since FH1, which means that both FH5 and FMR are not actually reboots.
>FH4 will never be moddable, because it got released on steam SO LATE, that FH5 is already coming out.
>So say goodbye to the Ford GTE LM 2017, probably the most iconic car in Forza history.
>It's pretty much confirmed FMR will be a carbon copy of FM7.
>rFactor, Automobilista, Raceroom, BeamNGDrive, and Project Cars have all been killed, so unless you have infinite money for iRacing, don't even try to switch to another simulator, since simulators do not exist anymore. Assetto Corsa, Assetto Corsa Competizione, and Assetto Corsa CM have about the same physics as a fucking mobile drifting game, so don't even try them.

8378,"This game has so far made my purchase worth it. Every penny spent on it made me feel good and well-spent as the vast amount of content, free-roam capabilities and astounding environment and simulation as well are the key highlights of the game.
One problem I faced was the game crashing after every 10 minutes due to some NVIDIA driver incompatibility issues which was fixed by lowering / rolling back to driver V22.25.
Since the roll back, I have encountered only one random crash till the present date. At the very great price it was bought by me on a sale typically, I can say that this game was offering a great time for a first time player like me entering into the world of Forza.",1

8380,"Dude so much fun. Once your ADHD settles down on the map icons. Jesus. Like ... sooo many icons. I wish there was a menu of races vs. 300 map icons.

Other than that, the rest of the game is like the Gran Turismo series with about 20% arcade added and WAY more customization.",1
8381,"I would really like to recommend this game, but because it keeps crashing every 20 minutes I cant. When they come out with a patch to fix this I will change my review to recommended.

However, this game with a Dolby Atmos setup is phenomenal! The sound design is absolute top notch. The Flying Scotsman race was one of my favourite gaming moments I've had in a loooong time. Going through tunnels, and hearing a train going over top of you is such a cool feeling. Driving Mid/rear engine cars and having the sound come from the rear speakers also is a nice detail that really makes it feel like you're in the car. 

This is one of the best casual racing/driving experiences you can have from the comfort of your living room. Its just a shame I have to keep restarting so often, I could probably play this for hours at a time.",0

Forza 4 freezes constantly, every time I play it I can do stuf until there is a reward screen or sometimes just changing screens and it freezes, The only way to close it is with task manager.
Save you money and frustration buy something else. This has been out a long time and if they have not fixed by now I doubt they ever will fix it.",0

8418,"The game is so beautiful and amazing, but at the moment I cannot recommend it to anyone:
It crashes every 5-10mins on both high and mid range hardware with the latest drivers and updates (tested on 12700k + 3080 12g and 1050ti). Sometimes I cannot even reach or finish a race and I'm back to my house. I can only hope that Playground games will fix. 
Edit: Seems like there is a problem with NVidia latest drivers... well it has been a month, no one can stay on outdated drivers for just one game.
Also the devs seems to have some weird idea that everyone likes to drive while listening music, so they don't give you option to disable it unless you turn off the entire game sound. After they spend so much time adding accessibility options they decided to force the distracting music covering the engine and the tires... Is the ego of whoever produced the soundtrack that big?",0

To log a ticket with Forza support you have to create an account with their system.  When you create an account with their system it gives you a random gamer tag.

Forza support never looks at my requests; they tell me ""please log in with the gamer tag you are using to play the game"", which is impossible because I'm playing on Steam and I can't log into their system with my SteamID.

However, it's FUN to drive around in the map even if the size isn't as big as Test Drive Unlimited.
There are couple of reasons like objects & building placement that makes you feel you're driving in the real area, and also seasons change so the area feels dynamic.
Race, games, & activities also spread around nicely so it doesn't feel empty.

The only drawback is loading time when the event is changing when you're playing with other people. It can take couple of minutes before the event is loaded (sometimes you believe that the game froze, but it's not, just need to wait).",1

In fact, this has become one of my go-to games when I want to relax. Multiplayer is pointless and infuriating with people using whatever exploits they can find to go faster than anyone else can possibly go, but there's no surprise there anymore, therefore simply forget it exists and you've got a near-perfect game.

My only criticism is that I'd like to see more longer races, rather than almost entirely short ones, even though you can create your own races with the blueprints feature.

Both, the developer and NVIDIA seem to be aware of a driver related problem causing constant crashes, and the only given advice is to downgrade the drivers. I'm imagining this will be solved at some point. But the most concerning for me is the fact that you can lose all of your progress very easily and there's no comeback. The developer should give that a check as well.

If you have an NVIDIA graphics card, then you will potentially get a very frustrating experience out of this game right now.",0

8646,This is a good game but it is a terrible port to pc.

One of the rare games which is worth the asking price.

If arcade racing in an open world setting sounds appealing don't miss this gem.

9/10 an easy recommend in a class of it's own.

Pro tip : Turn off rewind feature and increase AI difficulty to suit your skill and keep it challenging.

8679,"This game is pretty fun, when it's being fair and stable. The game has a tendency to crash every now and then if you're lucky, however if you're unlucky, you can play for about 5 minutes before you see a crash, and nothing appears to fix that.

The game has a bunch of challenges including seasonal ones, however a lot of them like speed traps are based a lot on luck because of the random AI cars that appear out of nowhere. The game is focused on multiplayer, but you'll often experience connection issues, disconnects, or the infamous ""fast travelling other players"" message for up to 30 minutes. That is completely unacceptable.

These are just a few cons with this game, I didn't even go into all the other glitches and bugs.

Would I recommend this game? Well, the game is really addicting and fun when it works, but considering the price point (which is way too much), I don't know whether the anger and frustration you'll experience is worth it. :)",0

Pros 
1. Graphics - they are so beautiful your eyes will feel relaxed and comforted looking at the screen,
You won't have ever seen such graphics in any game, they are just outstanding plus dynamic rendering is offered in graphics settings so no matter how bad your graphics card is, the game will give a playable fps.

2. Music-  Soundtrack is great, and there is a lot of variety because it has multiple radio stations with different genres of music to suit your taste.

3. Cars- a lot and lot of cars to play from, from off-road to super cars like the buggati this game offers them all

4. Driving mechanics:- great physics and handling offered, it's realistic but fun at the same time . 
5. The world:- there is a lot of terrain variety from muddy roads to highways to mountain driving to coastal driving, to stunt jumps.
6. Season:- seasons are the cherry on the topping of this cake, they are so well animated and alive that even people who don't care about them will really start loving changing seasons. The style of play and the terrain and ground slipperyness also changes with seasons just like in the real world and rain and snow graphics along with the autumn yellow orange leaves all are gorgeous.",1

8729,"Game has ads that you can't skip for all of the bundles and if it can't connect to the store when some of them play then the game freezes.
None of the cut scenes can be skipped so it's a waste of time.",0
8730,"Instant favourite! Why, here're the arguments.
First, the game concept is great. You're roaming around UK countryside, having races and building yourself a reputation. I'm newbie in this game, but I've love it after couple of hours driving.
How can I describe it? Easily, NFS:Underground meets Test Drive Unlimited. The variety of cars is yet impressive (even more with DLC, but I'm not supporter of DLC philosophy), and you can tune your favourite car at the endless possibilities (even the vintage ones). The ingame approach is perfect mixture of humour and seriousity, there're various racing types, and AI is also very customizable (from Teletubbies to the GT2 pros) which is also big pro for the game.
Each car has its unique handling, I mostly prefer AWD and FWD types, and handling has fine-tuning ability. Now I use vintage Opel Kadett and turned it into a beast with humble amount of credits.
Now the cons. First, most races are checkpoint based. The checkpoints have concept as skiing ones, if you fail to cross between them, you got penalties. Ok, this is not big con, only problem is I'm newbie and clumsy here, so I had to waste some time to adapt into this. But, sure, it's very interesting.
Second, little con(s) are ingame DLC advertising and plenty of DLC's, but nothing game-breaking. Huge PRO is endless ingame possibilities and non-linear mode of the game itself, which totally suits for most players. You create your world here, don't avoid this great possibility, if you're car racing fan.
SCORE: 9/10.
Update: Here's one critical con, which doesn't change the final score.
I've spotted one serious bug which I can't explain. If I visit the Photoscene safehouse, and leave it, the game freeze withut audio and crash without explanation. It occurs occassionally but luckily autosave restores previous point. Besides that, game is very addicting and worth reccomending.",1

8767,"Awesome racing game, my new favorite. Sadly never gave it a chance because I started with FH5 which just drowns you in cringey dialogue, over-the-top spectacle, and constantly patting you on the back, ""you superstar"". Uninstalled that, then played NFS Heat which was great--but short--and left me wanting more. Decided to give FH4 a try and I'm glad I did.

The base game has so much content and so many cars. It just feels like a big old sandbox to play in, and I've only touched the singleplayer so far. The upgrade and tuning systems can be a bit overwhelming at first but I appreciate all the nuance. It's much better than the answer always being to upgrade everything. I love how the AI's cars get beefed up to match your car's performance. The problem with NFS Heat was once you upgraded past a certain point, every race on the map was then trivial. Here you can play with either a hypercar or a junker and the AI will be relatively close in performance. The seasons are awesome and help the world feel alive. The soundtrack isn't particularly amazing but there's a decent variety. Overall this game is just tons of fun if you enjoy racing.

There are some things that bothered me though.
[list]
[*]The AI is obnoxiously robotic, sticking like glue to the racing line. They'll even ram you out of the way just to get back on the line. Also they have this weird tendency to be godly at driving when out in front but they're absolutely awful at passing. So if they're ahead, there's not much room for error. But suddenly when you pull ahead, the race is basically in the bag.
[*]Online racing load times are awful sometimes.
[*]Some tuning options are locked behind certain appearance upgrades, which sucks if you don't like how the upgrades look.
[*]If you download someone else's livery or tune, you can't customize it further. If you try to, it prompts you to erase the livery or tune before going into the edit mode.
[*]Car body customization is pretty lacking.
[*]Character customization is extremely lacking, but doesn't bother me too much.
[*]The winter season is a pain in the ass if only because I have to swap out the tires on every damn car I want to use for that week.
[*]Skills are a strange concept that I don't understand the point of. You do things like drifting, breaking objects, or going off jumps to get skill points. You spend these points on your car to unlock perks. These perks mostly just allow you to generate skill points more easily. And repeat? It's weird.
[*]The secret fast travel boards that you find around the map don't appear on the map until you drive really close by. Some of them I'm sure I would never find without the internet.
[*]Collisions are disabled with other players on the map. I understand why they do that, but I wish there was a toggle.
[*]The UI is a bit messy and not easy to navigate.

But still, the game was fun enough that I'm convinced to try FH5 again. And that's saying a lot.",1

Graphics is the best I've seen in a racing game. really top notch.... and runs fine on my dinosaur system
with all settings maxed out. (i5490, 8GB RAM, RX580 8GB)
Open world with other players is a great feature.

Some cons:  
more decals for customization is needed (flames, tears, etc)
more character customization.

Some cars dont handle well at all, but loving my M4 2018 GTS.

8837,"I didn't even realize I didn't write a review about this game. Well, here we go: 

I can recommend this game by any means. If you want to have a low price for Forza for now and want to play a good racing game with friends, this is one you should look out for. I bought this like a year ago in the Steam Summer Sale and since the release I've had the decision between Forza 4 and 5 and every time I've chosen to play Forza Horizon 4. It's a gorgeous map with beautiful differences in the map and the DLCs are awesome (apart from the LEGO DLC, I don't think LEGO belongs to Forza, I just bought it to have more things to do since I've done literally everything on all Expansions and the main map). I regularly start up this game and drift with a few randos through Fortune Island. Also if you want to play multiplayer, currently it's way better to play Forza Horizon 4 since the multiplayer in FH5 is absolutely broken, I don't know how they messed that up after 6 Years of stable multiplayer in their games but this one here works really fine. It's a shame you need to have your gamebar ready though. I don't want to lose performance on a useless Xbox bar. 

A sad thing that was there since the beginning is, that one of the best scenes is not replayable. The Intro. Why do you keep putting so much effort in a scene you'll ever see once and never again? Let us replay the scenes you put the most of your effort in, they're great but I want to replay them somethimes. And I don't want to delete my gamesaves for that.",1
8838,"This is best fusion of great graphics and amazing gameplay.

I have another expensive racing game called Assetto Corsa that I never played because my controller/ gamepad didn't work with it. Forza Horizon has really nice graphics even in low resolution mode. I tried one race and the driving seemed pretty easy, where in some other games it can be difficult to control the car. Some people say that they love this game and they spend a lot of time playing it but I have several other racing games I like such as Horizon Chase Turbo.",1

No problems at for the first 1-2 hours then it starts to crash. Happens mostly for me while at one of my houses checking auctions/buying cars etc. During race's or freeroam it's fine so not sure what's going on there. Sometimes i can play for hours without crashing then the next day it will crash 2/3 times within 10 mins ?. If you can see past this then i'd say buy it when it's on sale (about $20 i payed) and enjoy. :-)

This is better than Forza 5, but the racing does get boring eventually, it just gets an 8 for its good graphics. Asseto Corsa is a much better experience in terms of racing and drifting than FH4 and 5 combined.",1

Well let's head into the Cons, The game kinda gets dry as you progress, The endgame IMO is just to collect all the cars which is quite fun and challenging but after that.. what now? I pre-bought the Agera RS cause I really love Koenigsegg's super cars and I like it I'd probably just keep it then refund the game. The game stutters, freezes and crashes. I am a lazy mf and I don't like having to launch the game every now and then and who even likes game crashes? First time downloading it was fine, the game ran smoothly and the next time I launched it, it just went bonkers, the stutters just appeared out of no where then I crashed without even an hour later every single time I play the game, I watched some tutorials in youtube and none of them worked (I am running a Ryzen 5 5600x + RTX 3060 + 16GB Ram) so I just decided to refund the whole game, Idk if it's only on steam but the reviews just tells me that it's only on steam. Overall the game I would rate 8.5/10 and the experience 2/10.
UPD: Apparently I can't get a refund anymore since I exceeded the 2 hours gameplay.. Oh well I'll just keep it and try again if it crashes and you know what? I'll just recommend it cause of how beautiful the game is.",1

Sometimes game needs to be aknowledged pc user, and fix a lot buy urselfe, last one, game dies with latest nvdia drivers, only 522.25 works(hope it will be patched soon, bcause i need to swap drivers if i whant to play wz or forza).

9043,"I remember the good old times when I was playing TD Unlimited 2. I bought this game thinking that I would have the same fun. To my disappointment, I couldn't. Still this game is quite good. There are so many events you can participate in. You can get some of the expensive cars too easily to my liking yet again there are so many cars to get, so for a collector like me it's pretty enjoyable. You can upgrade your cars to your liking, which is also good. All in all, I like the game and recommend it.",1
9044,"The good:

The gameplay is quite fun and honestly more varied that FH5 (largely because there are actual distinct seasons, in contrast to FH5's dry/dry/dry/somewhat rainy)/

The bad:

The game world is much smaller than FH5.

The ugly:

The game will hard crash after about 15-30 minutes, no matter what. This is the only modern game I have that does this so egregiously. Yes, my computer is *plenty* strong (5850X, 64GB RAM, RTX 3080). If you look around, there are some reddit threads indicating that there's actually a catastrophically bad memory leak that MS/playground apparently have no intention of fixing.

Verdict: The PC port is unbelievably unstable. As fun as the game is (more fun in some ways than FH5), the excessive regular crashing makes it borderline unplayable - and absolutely unplayable in an online sense, as you'll often be unable to complete a tournament of 3 multiplayer races.",0

I wrote this review after 2 hours because I already know the scope of this game's contents and just wanted to check the technical quality of this PC port.

9178,"If you are a fan of the original Forza games on the 360, then this will disappoint.  It no longer is how forza used to be, it is now just now a new version of Need For Speed by having your handheld to a generic storyline, traffic that you have to dodge, and annoying side characters.  It is less about the cars and more about building your ""influence"" to open you up to new kinds of races.  Probably the worst thing about the game is the amount of time the game just crashes.  The game crashed after I won a race and now I cant even load the one and only save anymore, it just crashes midway through loading.  If you are a fan of the old Need For Speed games then you will probably like game more than if you're just interested in racing on professional racetracks, but then again, it doesn't matter if the game is guaranteed to crash anyways.",0

9241,The only difference between Forza 4 & 5 is the setting. Forza 5 might have ray traced car models but other than that everything is almost same with a little improvement in graphics. Car handling and models are realistic in both the games with plenty of customisation options. Drifting in this game is fun especially if you have a Logitech Wheel. However both games will become monotonous after playing for a while. Best to buy it on sale at a low price or try it out on Xbox game pass if you cant afford it.,1

9457,"When it doesn't have any issues, this game is amazing, I would easily say it's my favourite game in the world.. BUT... it has so so many problems on PC

First off I recently had to change my OS drive SSD (totally irrelevant drive to the one FH4 runs / is installed on) and it reset all my progress, I had a little over 700 hours at the time and it removed all aprox 800 cars I owned, cosmetics, influence, credits ect 

The game also has major issues with overlays being enabled, I would crash constantly whenever I went into a house or festival, disabled both Steam Overlay and AMD Adrenaline, it seemed to fix it... for about an hour, now it is back to normal, its a dice roll going to modify a car because I never know if it will crash or not

For some reason it has also caused blue screens of death on 2 occasions, not even the BSOD would tell me why

Both FH4 and FH5 have issues with AMD GPUs as well, I used to use a GTX 970 and had poorer performance overall but not as many random crash issues, since switching to my Radeon 590 FB, it has had a lot of issues, I thought I fixed them when I used driver uninstalling software to get rid of old Nvidia drives but it persists on FH4 and FH5, not as badly granted but it still has issues where there should be none

My final point is, if a company as big as Microsoft / XBOX want to add their games to PC, they should make their games work properly first instead of just saying ""that'll do"" at the end of the work day, the effort put into making this compatible with PCs is honestly pathetic, I absolutely love the game when it has no issues, I could easily spend 12 hours a day playing it and through Covid, I did on some days but for some reason, this game does not want to behave properly

Further more if anyone knows ways of fixing the issues I am having please say because I want to keep playing but this is just ruining the experience of Forza",0

9463,"I had a great time playing Forza Horizon 4. I would say that game engine is one of the most optimised out there with my frame rate sitting at 120fps constantly during game play. The game world is a mix of various areas within the UK all stitched together to showcase the best of what the UK has to offer. It was interesting driving around and seeing familiar road layouts and signs and even bins and pubs that look like those found in the UK. The level of detail is great even down to being able to see the interiors of certain buildings.

I think my favourite feature is the seasons and how this impacts the way the car handles and the environment. What are lakes during the summer freeze over during the winter allowing you to access new areas. As the seasons change so does the weather with a dynamic weather system which I really and looks extremely realistic.

I am moving onto Forza Horizon 5 now which I believe takes place in Mexico so I guess the seasonal changes are not going to be as drastic so this is a feature I am going to miss.

9624,"Updated 18 November 2022: Since October 22 the NVIDIA driver updates somehow don't work well with the game. In October the studio drivers in the end made the game work however since November 16 update the game crashes and gets stuck very frequently. When working, you can see my review bellow.

If you search for an addictive game, with FH4 you're on the right place. The graphics are still very, very nice, there are tons of content, cars, roads and beauties to explore, Scotland is simply a fantastic location. The physics are arcade (well driving through a wall, tree and a river in 5 secs and still continuing to drive isn't precisely a simulation to me), but FH4 offers a lot of fun and every car drivers differently. 
There are only few downsides for me: some races are simply too fantasy/foolish to me, AI is sometimes weird, and my TH8A doesn't work with the Steam version (only sequential gearbox works).

[list]
[*] I bought the DLCs up-front, so I unlocked like 100 cars in the first hour.  The was just overwhelming.  I'd have preferred if you paced them out a little better.
[*] It's England, but... also Scotland?  Trying to name-drop every city that Americans have heard of, ended up making the map feel really small.
[*] FH1 and (I think) FH2 had ""rivals"" with some basic character design, and getting to a new ""festival level"" meant beating them as a kind of boss.  This is completely gone; instead you just have MMO-style constant ""grind levels to make numbers go up slightly"".  This just feels dull.  Like in Borderlands 3 and Watch Dogs 2, ""get the most facebook likes"" is now a goal [b]everyone[/b] can identify with?
[*] the cross-promotions for Top Gear, Lego &c are boring.

9834,"This is one of the best driving games out there.
Grate handling , realistic to each car. Every engine sounds diffrent, every place you go is absolutly gorgeous and the dynamics of the First Person Camera are made just so it makes you feel like you are in a chase or somthing. 

I give it a 9/10 just because i havent got around to playing Horizon 5 yet and it might be better.
BUY IT !",1

9838,"Best racing game ever, you can look at my playtime. 
What a steal to get Ultimate edition during sales.
The things I don't like is exhaust sound and the smoke is not good as FH5 and there is no AMG One, R35 NISMO, GR Supra and GR86.",1
9839,"Even now in 2022 it's still way better than Forza Horizon 5 and has more cars.
The only negative thing i have to say about this game is that the price is a little too high and you should wait for a sale and that the servers don't work that well and you can't easily find online lobbys, races and some times even liveryes for your car BUT imo it's still a 9/10 game.",1
9840,"Why I bought this game:
-EXTREMELY good optimization (DX12 is required)
-It's in the UK, therefore it's driving on the same side of the road in my country
-Great driving experience, with a good balance between assisted vs. simulation (ABS, TC, SC, Steering Physics Dampening)
-Car tuning may look tedious but is extremely simple to understand. Can be done on the fly whilst driving in free roam

Keep in mind:
-Forza titles delist after a few years due to licensing. Google before buying in the near future to ensure you're not going to be buying a dead game.
-Deluxe Pack is better, as the optional Car Pack is not available for purchase separately IF you purchase the Standard Edition
-No impulse trigger support on Steam version. Check out my guide on how to fix it: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2716653204

Bad:
-Horizon Convoy is spotty at times
-Chatting options are limited. Only 4 preset chat messages can be used at a time whilst in-game.",1

After playing other games for a few weeks and getting absolutely bored, slaving away trying to find fun in GTA V, grinding Destiny 2, mindlessly making houses in the Sims 4, I decided to just give up and buy this, having seen it on sale for a bit. God, what a good decision.

The very start of the game doesn't waste a second before immediately empowering you. You drive to the festival, then you very quickly advance and level up, and find yourself racing trains, hovercrafts, a fucking Avro Vulcan, all the while Turn 10's incredible music selection blasts in the background, perfectly blending with the engine sounds.

Rallying around this map brought me back to the days of Xbox 360, drifting off Red Rock with my friend Sam, doing car meets and making the most ridiculous builds possible. For letting me relive those moments, thank you, Turn 10 and Playground Games.",1

Simple Review: Yes

Detailed Review:
i would prefer getting FH4 over FH5 as FH4 has more content in general and let me elaborate why im giving such a rating and saying such things.
Game's set in the UK and there's many beautiful environments to enjoy its not like FH5 where its only desert and forest, this has different seasons to it such as Fall, Winter, Spring, Summer, they all even bring special events and races exclusive to those seasons too.

Don't let me even begin on the cool collab content,
There's Cyberpunk 2077, LEGO, Halo, GTA
yes these are real collaborations you can actually find cars from those games
and most of them (aside from the LEGO) are free unlockables, you can get them from simply doing fun races.

There's also the Top Gear Event, and because the game is set in the UK it's the perfect setting
not to mention they hired the OG Top Gear guys not the new cast im talking about the OG cast of
Jeremy Clarkson, Richard Hammond, and James May, not to mention there's alot of cars you can unlock from simply playing the game.

I did the ""Night City"" Race and unlocked the Cyberpunk 2077 Quadra Turbo-R V-Tech
and it made my day.

Honestly the game is good fun, it's what a racing game should be fun and not a competitive p2w/p2p mess
like EA is doing.
This is why im giving this game a solid 10/10",1

It has a lot of content and stuff to do and the game focus is on having fun rather than being competitive. FH4 has more active players than FH5, and there's always people to play with in the events. Every car handling feels different specially when you combine that with all the different race types and seasons!

what I don't like or wish they add in upcoming games:
- There's no semi automatic shifting, you can't downshift if using automatic shifting. This is really necessary if you play using keyboard/controller.
- Wished races would be longer than 3 laps / farther spring races too.
- The menu has too many things which is great but also can be overwhelming for newcomers like me. The lack of tutorials and the seasonal events make me feel I don't know what to do next.
- There should be wayyy more car customization parts <3
- Player customization feels very limited. Cosmetics are ok.
- For people accustomed to driving on the left it feels awkward to do so on the right, SPECIALLY if you like using the interior cam T_T",1

10165,"This game is fine. It would be nice if it wasn't dedicated to seasons. What I mean is, there should be an option to turn off seasons and requirements for progression. If there was an option for modifying tracks and races in game, that would make this much better. But it is still fun for a Forza game.
Also it apparently doesn't recognize certain players for some reason. I bought a copy for a friend and we played for a good month but then the game stopped working for him. He could drive around and explore but couldn't join in any races or events. He's tried reinstalling the game and checking for updates; even searched the web for solutions. But could not find any solutions to his problem at all.

Update: This problem that my friend has is now one that I have. You would think this connection issue would be fixed by now but it's most likely being abandoned to prioritize Forza Horizon 5 or something.",0

10255,"If you are looking for a game that is actually good for racing and drifting, this ain't it chief. You will not like it. The drifting seemingly looks for where the rear tires are and if isn't set on the exact line, it won't register. In snowy area, the drifting is set to a direct path and it doesn't allow for even going on the edge. It identifies the spinning tires and if they aren't inside the area, the drift doesn't count. There are small dirt/mud roads that you have to drift in free mode events and they are unplayable as the cars with snow tires don't even grip up in snow and you have to drift around an impossibly small area in which your spinning HALF TO BE IN THE SMALL AREA. I'm talking an area as wide as your car. Being in between the flags? Nope, that isn't enough, gotta be in the center. It's dumb, literally dumb. The racing is worse, Microdick won't allow you to have even the tiniest of missing between the flags which can cost you the entire race. If you want a game that is actually worth the racing aspects, go for Need For Speed titles. This game somehow is worse than The Crew 2 and better than The Crew 2 at the same time. I'd also rather play annoying titles like Need For Speed Rivals where you have to stop your car just enough to be in range of the cops (which I find stupid). Why? Cause at least EA allows for a little bit of missing as it should be acceptable to be able to accidentally miss a few feet away from between the flags. I've had times where I have JUST BARELY missed the checkpoints and legit had to start over the race because I was too far in to catch up. It ruins the whole point of a game when you are too focused on being dead set in the middle. You worry too much about where you car is rather than sitting back and enjoying yourself. It would be 10x better if the game didn't focus on the tires for drifting and instead focused on where the entire car was positioned and how much was in the lane to count points for drifting. If it's snowy or middle of the lane for drifting, just quit the Forza Event, it's not worth the hassle. For racing, if you are the type of person who feels as though cutting a bit of the corner is ok, then this game isn't for you. It ruins the experience by being too strict about the boundaries. Microdick does not know how to make games. This kind of racing is better suited for walls going along the track. I'd rather see walls keeping me from going off the track rather than missing checkpoints because a company has their panties in a bunch about the players cutting like 2 feet away from the center of the checkpoint (especially when it's on a damn straight, like how is anyone cheating if they are 5 feet away from the checkpoint on a long straight????)

If Forza 5 is anything like this game in the racing aspect, I wouldn't buy that hot doggy shit either.",0

10303,"Good:

¬∑ very nice graphics;
¬∑ beautiful landcsapes;
¬∑ Great Britain;
¬∑ seasons change;
¬∑ absolutely brilliant photo mode.

Bad:

¬∑ the game crashes;
¬∑ small map (once you've driven most of the roads, you start to realise that for such a massive racing game the map is rather small, it takes few minutes to drive around or across the map ‚Äî same can be said about DLC);
¬∑ I had to install Xbox PC client to be able to connect with my friend online ‚Äî should have worked in Steam version, but nope, no matter what we did in Steam version didn't work;
¬∑ online is ridiculous: it's either ram fest or everyone drops driving on the road and cuts through forest;
¬∑ AI is too easy at the hardest difficulty level, I win effortless 95% of the time;
¬∑ I do get that the game is an arcade, but even with simulation settings the physics are too arcady for my taste;
¬∑ the game crashes;
¬∑ career mode starts from pretty high point and rolls downhill fast: you get the vibe, the feeling of the festival only at early stage of the game ‚Äî the more you immerse yourself into, the less interesting the career becomes;
¬∑ Forza Horizon identity problem: the game tries hard to please everyone and doesn't do particularly well in every instance ‚Äî circuit racing and sprints are nothing special, drift is so-so, drag sucks, dirt racing is kinda meh, tuning has too many restrictions like the only option for bumpers and sideskirts or only select cars can have widebody kits, some spoilers aren't adjustable, etc;
¬∑ absolutely atrocious, abominable soundtrack with few radiostations and too short set list ‚Äî wait, there's more ‚Äî if you listen to album versions of the songs used for FH4 soundtrack, you'll get to know that songs were heavily censored;
¬∑ the game crashes;
¬∑ no matter how shitty your driving skills are, you'll get rewarded for no reason: you drive @350 km/h ‚Äî get xxxx points, you pass other cars by ‚Äî get xxxx points, you can drift ‚Äî get xxxx points, you miss the braking point and smash the fence ‚Äî get xxxx points, you didn't smash anything during past 3 seconds of driving ‚Äî get xxxx points, you've destroyed 3000 trees in the forest ‚Äî get xxxx points ‚Äî WHY? Why cater to the lowest denominator of instant gratification?
¬∑ like almighty Skyrim horse, you can climb vertical walls in your multi-million dollar hypercar with 8 cm road clearance ‚Äî some realism wouldn't hurt, PGG;
¬∑ unskippable cut scenes with idiotic ""reactions"" (moves), unskippable cut scenes of cars entering the house court, unskippable animations of your amazing car in the garage ‚Äî ENJOY OUR ANIMATIONS, USERNAME! ‚Äî waste of time;
¬∑ did I mention idiotic ""reactions""/moves/dances on stage?
¬∑ did I mention that the game crashes?
¬∑ the map is riddled in various activities but paradoxically there's nothing interesting to do in the game;
¬∑ the game gets painfully boring after 10 hours;
¬∑ you can jump 800 meters long off a cliff in your Koenigsegg and get away unscathed ‚Äî yep, FH is no BeamNG, but some realism wouldn't hurt and higher stakes will make the game more interesting ‚Äî no fatal damage kinda devalues what you can do in the game and your stupid stunts get repetitive and boring pretty quickly;
¬∑ you earn too little money by winning races, but you earn too much from spinning the lottery ‚Äî what's the reason to race the race?
¬∑ I've installed the game and in 2 hours of spinning the lottery wheel I got like over 250 cars in the garage while starting no race whatsoever ‚Äî if I can expand my car collection so easily, why bother racing at all? Even in NFS Undergroud you were starting from slow 4-cyl hatchback and slowly building up;
¬∑ get rid of this annoying lottery in FH6, PGG! Instant gratification kills the sense of accomplishment;
¬∑ your character doesn't talk;
¬∑ the game crashes;
¬∑ the game crashes;
¬∑ the game crashes;
¬∑ the game crashes.

All in all, Playground Games has put all their effort into welcoming warm start for newbie gamer. A gamer gets pleasantly surprised and thinks the game will remain like that the whole time he dedicates playing it, but he's unaware that the initial excitement gradually fades away and after some vaguely defined point in career, he's starting to feel alone in this boring, uninteresting world, that is paradoxically overloaded by various activities he can't be bothered interested by. I can tolerate to this laundry list of problems (some of which are fundamental and irredeemable) only if I consider the game as a mean of short relaxation after rough day at work. As an enthusiast car game BeamNG with mods wipes the floor with all Forza Horizon games released to date, including 5th, the Mexican one.

Quantity, not quality ‚Äî that's Forza Horizon's motto.",0

Believe me it really does not disappoint, the visuals are stunning, frame rate never dropped, draw distance is fantastic and the overall environment, scenery and aesthetic is unparalleled. If you can afford then buy the ultimate edition with all the DLC and content as it just adds to the immersive experience, the driving mechanics aren't the most realistic, but they are far from the most arcade like, its a fun game, its there to let your hair down, have some fun and go bonkers in some of your dream cars. Overall this game is up there as one of the best, and driving in Edinburgh really doesn't get any better than this. Well done to Forza for making something so great and amazing!",1

I got the game because I love driving and love cars so why do I need to play a campaign to get multiplayer in my mind it makes no sence why you would make a game like that unless you know people won‚Äôt play that much campaign if they could just skip it 

All in all this is a good game. But they made a massive mistake when they made you have to unlock multiplayer from what I can read it‚Äôs the same in forza 5 and that‚Äôs the exact reason I won‚Äôt buy it.

Wasted MANY hours debugging (without success) and a lot of money.
Also, I can't join any online event. I wouldn't have any problem with that, but since some events are online or co-op only It pisses me off.

10449,"My context probably heavily influences how I feel about this game: I'm a longtime arcade racing fan. I've played and liked many of the early NFS titles starting from 1999. Over the past 15 years, I've primarily played Trackmania titles, which are easy to start with, but require lots of skill to master, and have a highly competitive online mode. As player counts are decreasing though, I was looking for another arcade racing game. After many hours of research, I've found FH4 or FH5 to be promising candidates. I briefly thought about buying both, as I had a hard time deciding. Reading some of the concerns about FH5 on Reddit though, led me to choose FH4.

But what can I say? It's quite the disappointment. Confusing menus. There is no sense of progression, you get loads of cars for free, and you don't know which ones to spend credits on. The standard difficulty levels are way too easy, and it takes some time before it gets challenging. At that point its not clear though why some cars are suddenly faster. The handling of most cars is abysmal. And the whole ""storyline"" -- if one can call it that -- is cringeworthy at best.

If you enjoy fun arcade racing and liked Trackmania, stay away.",0

Playing multiplayer is awful with players running you off the road and you have to wait in a lobby for like 20 to 30 minutes before getting to your next race, it's bad. Players will run you off the road and some people even keep their mic on so you can hear all their crap. The game feels lonely because it's hard to make friends and you can't talk to people out in free-roam. Overall it's a fun game. Buy it.",1

10462,"I can't recommend you buy this to play on Steam Deck.

I purchased it in a sale after it went from 'Unsupported' to 'Playable', but in my experience it should still be listed as Unsupported.

For the first two hours or so, the game was great. It was one of the main reasons I bought a Steam Deck and in ran great - looked fantastic, the cars handled wonderfully and I thought I'd be in for a long, fun gaming time. 

However. First the sound in-game stopped completely. I verified the files, uninstalled and reinstalled, tried with Bluetooth on and off, different versions of Proton, WiFi on and off... the problem seems to be with Echo-Cancel-Sync. The only way I can get sound is to play in desktop mode and put the Raven volume to 100%
I could live with that, just, but there are also very regular freezes, stutters and crashes.
The last race I tried against the Flying Scotsman got to 97% race distance then froze, telling me the controller had disconnected. On a Steam Deck.

Looking at forums it seems there are quite a few people experiencing myriad crashes with this game. It's a big shame, I really like the game but I'm not able to play it. I currently have 9.3 play hours on record but have probably spent that amount of time again faffing with settings and restarting after crashes.",0

It doesn't work. It crashes regularly and gets considerably worse and more frequent after the 3-4 hour mark,which conveniently is long enough for steam to refuse a refund. This isn't just me; proton db and steam's own support pages have this complaint.

This should not be labelled as playable on steam deck.

It's a great game by the way, it's the fact that I've paid for a game that doesn't work on steam hardware when they say it does that irks.",0

10500,"My name is Walter Hartwell White. I live at 308 Negra Arroyo Lane, Albuquerque, New Mexico, 87104. This is my confession. If you're watching this tape, I'm probably dead, murdered by my brother-in-law Hank Schrader. Hank has been building a meth empire for over a year now and using me as his chemist. Shortly after my 50th birthday, Hank came to me with a rather, shocking proposition. He asked that I use my chemistry knowledge to cook methamphetamine, which he would then sell using his connections in the drug world. Connections that he made through his career with the DEA. I was... astounded, I... I always thought that Hank was a very moral man and I was... thrown, confused, but I was also particularly vulnerable at the time, something he knew and took advantage of. I was reeling from a cancer diagnosis that was poised to bankrupt my family. Hank took me on a ride along, and showed me just how much money even a small meth operation could make. And I was weak. I didn't want my family to go into financial ruin so I agreed. Every day, I think back at that moment with regret. I quickly realized that I was in way over my head, and Hank had a partner, a man named Gustavo Fring, a businessman. Hank essentially sold me into servitude to this man, and when I tried to quit, Fring threatened my family. I didn't know where to turn.
Eventually, Hank and Fring had a falling out. From what I can gather, Hank was always pushing for a greater share of the business, to which Fring flatly refused to give him, and things escalated. Fring was able to arrange, uh I guess I guess you call it a ""hit"" on my brother-in-law, and failed, but Hank was seriously injured, and I wound up paying his medical bills which amounted to a little over $177,000. Upon recovery, Hank was bent on revenge, working with a man named Hector Salamanca, he plotted to kill Fring, and did so. In fact, the bomb that he used was built by me, and he gave me no option in it. I have often contemplated suicide, but I'm a coward. I wanted to go to the police, but I was frightened. Hank had risen in the ranks to become the head of the Albuquerque DEA, and about that time, to keep me in line, he took my children from me. For 3 months he kept them. My wife, who up until that point, had no idea of my criminal activities, was horrified to learn what I had done, why Hank had taken our children. We were scared. I was in Hell, I hated myself for what I had brought upon my family. Recently, I tried once again to quit, to end this nightmare, and in response, he gave me this. I can't take this anymore. I live in fear every day that Hank will kill me, or worse, hurt my family. I... All I could think to do was to make this video in hope that the world will finally see this man, for what he really is",1

10542,"Played all Forza Horizon games, on numerous platforms, own this one and FH 3. And I gotta say, I find this one to be the best of them. Hard to nitpick each detail, but the overall experience wins in my book. Sure FH5 has slightly better graphics, but the map is much more bland. Sure FH3 has the outback, but this one has actual seasons! The stories themselves are quite entertaining as well:) Plus the way they handled the British countryside, a marvel. Really enjoy just driving around, soaking it all in. Recommend wholeheartedly!",1
10543,"This game would be amazing if they fixed it, seems like lots of people are having the same issue I am: consistent crashing after the 7 hour mark. 

A real shame, it‚Äôd be the best racing game on Steam if it were stable.

Edit: I was playing on Steam Deck, switching to Windows installed on the internal drive fixed the issue. I don't recommend trying to play this on Steam OS but it's great on Windows.",1

If you are a fan of Juiced 2 but are pissed cuz it wont run on Windows anymore, then look no further. This game is amazing with lots to do an the graphics are extremely satisfying.

This game is simply not meant to be played on PC. Most of the time I go to boot up this game, I get met with an error saying I can't connect to the online portion of the game. At one point the game continually restarted my progress every time I played. I spent probably 20 hours total trying to get all 200 boards in the map because once I got all of them, the game would reset the progress for the day. 
The network issues for the game have carried over 2 different computers as well. Not to mention Microsoft's attempt to fix their PC connectivity to Xbox servers is pitiful.
If we ignore all that tho, good game would recommend. In this state however, I cannot.",0
10721,"Best arcade racer since Burnout Paradise. I'm almost 200 hours in and have yet to even touch the expansions. There is plenty to do. Still has an active online community most of the time, and the weekly seasonal challenges area great way to expand your garage. 

It's not without its flaws though. Biggest gripe I have is the inability to mute other players in the game. If you get into the seasonal multiplayer challenges, you sometimes get really lucky and enjoy the sweet sweet sounds of some random guy, chewing his food while his girl yells at his screaming kids the entire time you are doing the challenge because some ***hole forgot to mute their mic. There is literally no way to mute them nor is there a way to turn off VOIP. How this feature, which is in literally evey other game i've ever played, gets ignored is beyond comprehension.

Also, occasionally there are infinite loading loops and long load times during multiplayer events that cause other players to quit instead of waiting, which can ruin an in-progress multiplayer championship.

10751,"The game in and of itself is nice. The story missions are fine. However, it is all pretty useless and long in the tooth due to the endless delays on Rockstar's servers. You wait for nearly half an hour to ""fast travel"" participants to events or get a message that servers are unavailable after a wait of about 15 minutes. Until the servers get sorted, I would avoid anything Rockstar. Just got asked to re-evaluate the game after more hours of gameplay. Ok, I would seriously never have considered purchasing this if I had known about the server issues. I enjoy just pottering around the countryside, but all online seasonal events are useless and I do not even bother trying to load them anymore. I will certainly not be purchasing sequels or other games by this develpper!",0

10867,"I'm not sure how to characterize it, but this is much more than a game; it's a mood-altering phenomenon. It doesn't matter if you're melancholy, depressed, stressed, suicidal, or anything else; just a short drive in this masterpiece can dramatically alter your mood for betterment.
I admire playground studios for supporting me through my worst hour.",1

10869,"Bought this game 65% off which is half the price of 5. Played for 6 hours and just driving and enjoying the scenery is very satisfying.  Main reason I went with Forza Horizon 4 instead of 5 is because of the lush green fields of the UK setting in 4. Also the seasons in 4 are so well done! Seasons change every week and each of winter, summer, autumn, spring feel distinct and pretty. Winter is definitely my favorite because snow. First few hours you get to play all seasons. Graphics are extremely beautiful. Some races are really cool which you wont find in other racing games like racing a giant hovercraft down a mountain and racing a train. Game ran smooth without any stutters. Very happy with this one.",1
