I like that you can upgrade cars, post share your upgrades and make money from them every time someone downloads them. I like that it's set in the UK instead of America like other games.",1,0,0,10183

120,"feels good, looks good, good variety of cars and overall a lot of fun.

however, I can no longer recommend the game. Right now, it's borderline unplayable. It freezes all the time and I have to close the game, and many players are having similar issues. What's worse, I just lost all of my progress today for no reason. I didn't do anything to the game except reinstall it to try and fix the freezing and now I no longer have any progress or any of my cars. I have no idea if Microsoft is responsible but they probably are given how much they neglect this game and allow it to have issues.

On top of that, the game already had a bunch of issues. Online connection is bad and online matchmaking is atrocious, one of the worst I've ever seen. frequent freezes and errors with loading in everything are common, to the point where people avoid most online match types because they expect them to bug out (and they often do).

there are various other problems but I'd have to write an essay to cover everything.

I've had this game crash repeatedly when I made changes that needed to be saved on the server profile: a cars upgrade purchases/tuning settings, auction house interactions and livery design interactions. This makes a lot of the menuing a ticking timebomb of just wondering if the next tune setup is going to crash the game and loose you 10 minutes. Considering I managed to replicate this bug with the same car repeatedly it feels like just something the publisher isnt willing to invest time in to fix.

The always online live service stuff also leaves a bad taste in my mouth, since it means that even if you just wanna do some solo driving in the countryside you might get physics rubberbanding thanks to lagspikes which make cars undrivable whenever that happens.
Also the unskippable dlc ad cutscenes are grating.
Also also the unskippable intro gets really annoying after the 4th crash in a row.

I have experienced quite a few game crashes though, so bear that in mind. This is frustrating, as you always start at your house regardless of where you were or what you were doing when it closes.

EDIT: I'm coming back now after almost finishing the game completely, it's been great and I'd still definitely recommend it.

That being said, I have some more criticisms. Despite being set in Great Britain, almost every car is LHD and very few even have a number plate on the front, even sometimes when there is an obvious place for one. This is quite disappointing to see and feels a bit lazy. Another thing, online adventure is a pain to play, there is a 10 minute plus wait between races even when already in a room, also it almost never changes your rank. These issues have been known about for some time, yet there is no fix.",1,1,1,

270,"Look, before i start, this is a good game. cars go vroom, handling is fun, and its ultimately what ive come to expect from a non kart racing game. but there are some questionable choices that have been made as part of the fundemental design of the game that im just not sure about. wheelspins are lootboxes that while yes they give out frequently seem to have their drops tied with progression, which will eventually dry up as i play on. the ui has the feel of ""this is the forth one fans, you know where the thing you want is"" when im just jumping in. many features of the game seem to be heavily progression locked, (my current complaint being fast travel, but the daily objectives was the previous hurdle) 

but mostly all of this could be forgivable if i could just race against other people. ive seen them in the world, and no i know the difference between the fakes and the real deal, but there is no matchmaking or queueing system from what i can tell, you're expected to go up to an event and be able to race against others but most of the time you end up getting kicked because nobody came to race, so you end up queuing against bots, which is boring as they don't seem to have any personality to driving besides follow the line. i want drivers who actively try to fuck me not good clean racers.

oh, did i mention that since a newer title has come out in the series they've put this one into maintenance mode? no new content is fine but ive noticed my connection to online has been shittier since the release of the newer title, pointing to them changing something behind the scenes. so if you want to play a racing game start with the newer title, and avoid this one.",0,1,0,

There's a ""spin the wheel"" game where you can win a bugatti veyron, but then the wheel will tick over to the next prize, a pink sweater you can dress your character in.  Whiskey Tango Foxtrot.  But at least it's not as bad as some stupid emoji dance you can make your character do when they win...oh wait, no, it is.

The clutch isn't a real clutch, it's just a button you push while selecting the gear.  If you're stopped you don't need to push in the clutch to stop the engine from stalling.  For supposedly one of the best car enthusiast games I would have appreciated a fully working clutch.  The shifting mode is determined by your difficulty level, not by the actual car, so you tend to have go through the setting when you get done driving a fully manual four speed like a 71' Dodge Charger to a 14' Dodge Charger with an slap stick 8 speed automatic.  WHISKEY TANGO FOXTROT.  I ain't got time to shift through 8 gears.  It's an automatic for a reason!

Just the whole game is obnoxious, but I've already paid for it so I guess I'll keep playing :(

So to some it up, this game is great if you want to feel like you're driving a car but you don't actually want the work behind driving a car.  And again, it's obnoxiously flamboyant.",0,0,1,

I spent a lot of time trouble shooting it and tracked it down to my Fanatec CS 2.5 Wheel. Apparently you have to download a 4 year old driver to use it with FH4. I submitted a trouble ticket 2 years ago and they ignored it and moved on to FH5.

Car upgrade and tuning mechanics might be better balanced but enough for a arcade-y simulation, i believe.

But it's one of those games that eventually becomes a job to play, because they try to trick you into playing and spending money ingame more than they try to give you good racing content. Amazingly, I quickly ran out of races, doing mostly night racing an normal racing events. After few days, I simply had no more of those, ignoring the lego-dlc, which I haven't tried. It's amazing how fast a game of this supposed scope becomes boring. I really dislike the horizon formula, imo its a completely broken progression system.

You would think that the player made races would provide some form of endgame after you've done the content you like, but 99% are just ""get money fast"" races, which are designed to break the AI. People do this because the game turns into a job if you want to grind for the expensive things. Really bad monetization effect.",0,1,0,

553,"Great racing game with a lot to do and tons of cars to collect. The game has several different types of races all over the map, as well as side events like speed zones, drifting, and business that grow in value with more challenges completed. The sheer amount of events you can participate in is impressive, and there are weekly and monthly challenges that give you new and rare cars. The two major DLCs are great, I felt like the races in those were higher quality than the base game and add new mechanics. The Lego one is especially good, it adds lego cars and a challenge system to build your house, very cool. The gameplay is halfway between a more casual experience and a racing sim, i liked how you can alter different settings to make it more casual or serious depending on what you want out of it. 

I only have a few criticisms, one being the online. The game is a few years old at this point and FH5 came out not too long ago so most of the people playing are really good and have top tier cars. It makes it hard to do well, but thankfully for most multiplayer weekly challenges you just have to finish a game, not win. The other major criticism is the base game races can get a little boring after a while. There are a lot, but since they all are based on the overworld there's not a lot of variety in scenery or unique layouts in the track. I felt the DLC races were significantly more interesting due to the more unique scenery and landscapes.",1,1,1,

           What a jerk. Sorry, buddy. Looks
           like it's the end of the line.
           Buddy?
                         
          ON CRABBY'S DECK: Finn is gone.

          FINN - He HANGS off the side of COMBAT SHIP, clandestine.
                         
          We're with Finn as the ship continues on, cuts through the
          darkness with purpose. Suddenly small flames appear, perhaps
          a knot or so away. Then WHOOSH!!! A flame rises above Finn,
          the ship. It illuminates an OIL DERRICK.

          THWAP! Finn fires a GRAPPLING HOOK to the derrick and SWINGS
          toward it. He's going to SLAM into the side with brute force
                         WHEN ---

Let's begin:

Pro's: 
You can customize any vehicle in the game to your liking, it has an amazing tuning editor, and an easy to get-into vinyl editor. I absolutely love making vinyl for cars, and tunes. Even making entirely unique tunes that suit my driving style. The many cars to choose from make it all the better, having such an extreme variety of cars makes it one of the best games out there for this option alone. 

Con's:
The physics is hit or miss, I love the game and all, but I do not have a bias toward it saying that its physics are ""godly"" and I don't like to be biased about things I play either. Considering I see people talk about the games physics, from actual racecar drivers all the way to regular gamers stating the physics is a bit over the top, and slidey. This actually holds a lot of merit, especially when more than 70% of all the races, during most of the seasons are either:
-Rain
-Post rain
-Hard rain
-Snow
-Ice

It doesn't help when you have so many people defending the physics saying it's ""not too bad"" when it actually gets frustrating after a while. This also doesn't get into the weird hitboxes, and road glitches that absolutely make the races even more frustrating. Let's actually get to that one now.

The weird hitboxes and random stopping of cars from top speed all the way to zero is infuriating, it makes it worse when almost everyone that decides to make stupid as fuck speed builds use the rally suspension. This causes more people to complain about an issue that isn't that big of an issue, unless you somehow hit a weird spot on a bridge without even touching the railing, this gets even more infuriating with the roads, where your car will somehow fly off the road because the game decided: ""Nah, I don't like how you're racing"" - I've experienced this more than enough times to really get me in a particularly bad mood. This, along with how weird the roads are in the circuits, from smooth, to random elevation changes. This makes the racing experience pretty annoying to deal with. Especially for newer players.

Customization:
This is both a pro and con, but this is actually about bodykits, to aero. So, the biggest thing I love to do is tune my cars to look similar to their GT varients, and you can do this for a few cars, but the lack of cars that you can do it with is a bit annoying when it comes down to uniqueness. This part doesn't bother me, but it for sure bothers other people. Hence why I mentioned it. Though, the Forza Aero is almost always the ""rice special"" that is, on most cars, there are some good cars without this issue. However, it's almost always the option for downforce. Which isn't the greatest thing in the world, when you have to stick it on cars that need it for better track capability. I find it ridiculous, but I can't exactly complain because I enjoy handling over top speed.

Builds:
One thing that leaves me irritated is the same-y builds that people use all the time, especially in rivals. The V12 swap, all-wheel-drive special. Gotta be honest, I get it's easy to do, but are you pulling my leg? I honestly hate ""META"" builds, and ""META"" in any game possible, so this one is purely subjective. 

Crashing/lagging:
This one is annoying as fuck to deal with, and to be honest; try every solution you find, and even reinstall the game if you have to - to see if you can get it working without these issues. I hate how it's one of the biggest problems that this game has, because the game is so fun to cruise around in, and enjoy over the summer, or whenever you feel like playing. 


Though with all that said and done, I recommend this game if you're into simcade style racing games, I love games like this as they often leave me in awe and because of the customization for vinyl and tuning, I tend to have an extreme liking to this, and I especially love how everyone can see your vinyl that you've setup on the car itself.",1,1,1,

750,"Pretty good semi-realistic racing game. I'm normally a fan of more arcadey stuff but this one was an exception. 

I've played Gran Turismo and Test Drive Unlimited and couldn't get into them because I hated the way the cars handled but in this game there is a pretty good balance with how they handle to heavily encourage realistic racing while also allowing you to do some risky stuff sometimes which is pretty fun. There is also well over 600 cars to drive that can all be tuned so this game is definitely not lacking in the content department (Though I do wish the open world was a bit bigger)

I think the biggest criticism I have is in regards to the multiplayer. The game is clearly built around multiplayer to the point that it can be kind of a detriment; endgame is clearly built around multiplayer and participating in the ""adventures"" and some of the seasonal events require other people to be participating in it as well or you just can't play them. I won't lie I'm pretty biased towards encouraging more singleplayer than multiplayer content but it would at least be nice for to be able to do these events with AI when there are no other players as opposed to just missing out on them entirely, because as a result of this design decision there are times where there is really nothing to do and the everything can feel empty as a result.

Also it would be cool to have track races, and yeah I know that 1: thats what the main Forza series is for and 2: the lego DLC has a track area, but having a handfull of track races that take place seperate from the main maps as part of a ""track racing series"" would be pretty cool and I don't think it would be redundant considering the Horizon series is way less focused on realism.",1,1,1,

The mechanics are a solid upgrade from something like Asphalt or GTA driving, but not to the point of being entirely for full-control driving sim players. It feels great to play with a keyboard, but even better on controller. The graphics are stunning and downright impressive for a nearly four-year-old game - its graphical quality even competes with games released last year. I have yet to play Horizon 5, but from what I've seen, it's even better. Don't let that deter you from buying this absolute gem though - if you can get a good discount like I did during the Summer Sale, just go for it. I will soon be trying Horizon 5, and I'm really eager to see the improvements they made.

871,"Finally, a good racing game! The devs really put some work into this. 

For years, I've had to deal with crap racing titles that start off easy enough, but amp up the difficulty exponentially as you progress through the game to the point where it's literally impossible to win a race. Thankfully, that isn't the case here; it's challenging, but not insanely difficult. There are plenty of activities including street racing, off road racing, drifting, jumps, stunt driving, (online, LAN, or solo) and more. 

I enjoyed the environments and the extensive collection of vehicles. Great visual and mechanical customization, too.

I wish there were more options for engine swaps. however the upgrading on engines for particular make/models of vehicles its pretty dependant on what you would like to do with the vehicle. A totally topped out vehicle doesnt automatically mean that it is the best setting for that vehicle in particular.

Yes, Fh5 has many improvements from FH4 which has been great to see BUT: IN FH4; You have to buy a house in order to get skill songs and also the fact that NPCS can be hit while trying to get a speed zone!? Noooo..

I absolutely love the FH series, may it be a comfort game for me idk. (It most definitely is now) 

if you like speed, and venturing through the English country side, you must play this game along with the almighty Fh5. 

This game and FH5 demonstrates not only the  performance of vehicles, but the fun you can have with them. Each vehicle you choose is unique, (I highly recommend switching your audio settings to car only to maximise your experience.)

I like to drive in the first-person point of view, behind the steering wheel, and have enjoyed the realism. I'm a PC gamer, but have been playing with an Xbox controller, and it's neat to feel the feedback in the controller as you slip off the pavement, drive down a rutted road, or over Lego studs.

I have the setting on ultra and the game runs real smooth and looks fucking awesome if you have a curved monitor. But overall this game is a definite buy. You will experience the 4 seasons. Summer, Autumn, Winter and Spring. Get ready and buckle up so you can race into the world of Forza Horizon 4.",1,1,1,

I've played only 5 hrs but this is so annoying already. You play a 1 minute race but you MUST sit and watch a 20 sec cutscene, then watch player's showcase with cars and shit for another 10-20 sec or so, then you finally can have fun playing, after that you must wait a post-race score showcase and shit again for 10-20 seconds or so, sometimes roll for goodies. Add loading times on top of that. You end up spending half of the time just doing NOTHING! EVERY. FUCKING. RACE. YOU SIT AND DO NOTHING HALF OF THE TIME.

Dear Microsoft, give us at least an OPTION to skip, because this is just ridiculous.

Forza Horizon 4 is very friendly to newcomers, has a stunning visuals and sound design, tons of cars, pretty big community and 100+ hours of content. It is also a great therapy game so you can just turn off your brain and drive around UK in your favorite car to some music and simply relax. Highly recommend.",1,1,1,

☐ You forget what reality is
☑ Beautiful
☐ Good
☐ Decent
☐ Bad
☐ Very bad
☐ EYERAPE

---{Gameplay}---
☐ Very good
☑ Good -- Gameplay is simple, drive cars and compete in races. Though the gameplay is relatively simple, the game is very engaging and fun.
☐ Normal
☐ Mehh
☐ Bad...
☐ Watch paint dry instead

---{Audio}---
☐ Eargasm
☑ Very good -- The car noises are different for each car, sounds very real, nice soundtrack and radio option.
☐ Good
☐ Not too bad
☐ Bad
☐ Earrape

---{Audience}---
☑ Kids
☑ Teens
☑ Adults

---{PC Requirements}---
☐ Check if you can run paint
☐ Potato
☐ Decent
☑ Fast -- Brilliant graphics, may need a pretty good computer to run. You can adjust the graphics to fit your needs though.
☐ Rich boiiiiii
☐ Ask NASA if they have a spare computer

---{Difficulity}---
☐ Just press ‚A‘
☐ Easy
☐ Somewhat Easy
☑ Normal -- On the surface, the game and controls are pretty easy, but in certain terrain and turns, you may have to be meticulous with your car. Try not to drift out of control in certain areas.
☐ Difficult
☐ Dark Souls & Elden Ring 

---{Fun Level}---

☐ Boring, lackluster
☐ Can get fun sometimes
☐ Normal
☐ Pretty Fun
☑ Very Fun -- Many things to do, but depending on the person the game could get boring later. Personally, I love the game and think its very fun.
☐ MAXIMUM DOPAMINE

---{Grind}---
☐ Nothing to grind
☐ Is not necessary to progress
☑ Depends -- In this game, you can grind with races, or just explore, choose your path with grinding. If you want to collect cars or money, you may have to put in some time.
☐ Average grind level
☐ Too much grind
☐ You‘ll need a second life for grinding

---{Story}---
☐ Story?
☐ Text or Audio floating around
☐ Average
☑ Good -- The story is not really why most people play this game. I mean, maybe unlocking new races or roads count as story but otherwise it is just good.
☐ Lovely
☐ It‘ll replace your life

---{Game Time}---
☐ Long enough for a cup of South Asian milk tea...
☐ Short
☐ As long as you want
☐ Long
☑ To infinity and beyond -- In an open-world game like Forza Horizon 4, it is almost impossible to beat the game. You race, and you can collect around 500 cars, as well as explore and drive around the majestic world of Forza.

---{Price}---
☐ It’s free!
☐ Completely worth it
☐ Fair Price
☑ Wait for a sale -- Excluding sales, the game is 60$... you may want to wait for some time, I got the game thanks to a good ol' steam sale for only 20$. However, if you want to get the game ASAP, or if you have waited long enough, you can buy it if you want. Spend wisely!
☐ If u have some spare money left
☐ Not recommended
☐ You could also just burn your money

---{Bugs}---
☐ Never heard of
☑ Very small amount of bugs -- There are very few bugs where the game may crash, for example, if I open up the global leaderboard for a speed trap, my game becomes unresponsive. Some people have had more bugs such as the game not saving or constant crashes, however, I have yet to encounter them. (But to be fair, I have only played for 10 hours as of writing this review).
☐ Minor bugs
☐ Can get annoying
☐ Cyberpunk 2077
☐ The game itself is a big terrarium for bugs

Conclusion: 

Forza Horizon 4 is a game with great graphics, an engaging world, and fun races. It is a game that you can spend a lot of time and still have fun wrecking travel boards or attempting for a new high speed. There are minor bugs and most do not affect gameplay in a major way.

Forza 4 sets a standard for racing games in my opinion. 
Forward, backwards and drifting with automatic gears.

The graphics are beautiful and so are the cars.
The game is fun with a good variety of activities to do.
 
The game sadly has a gambling mechanic with a wheel of fortune type of thing.
The game has a hidden or obvious difficulty in some races, by that, I mean slower cars generally make a race a lot easier than with fast cars. This is in addition to how you normally would choose a difficulty.
The game also needs you to make an Xbox account, but it doesn't require a separate launcher.

The game should have music that most people enjoy with a handful of varied radio stations.
And you can a lot of customisation which I personally really enjoys.

Overall a very good experience with a few minor hiccups 8.5 out of 10 from me.",1,1,1,

1519,"Before I start this review, I have 65 hours on my Xbox through Xbox Game Pass and have beat the game there.

This game is a must-buy during any sort of sale because the developers have finished working on it, meaning that all the expansions and DLC cars are out and provide lots more content that Forza Horizon 5, which is still pending a 2nd expansion and the 1st one being released soon. The storyline is okay, it's nothing too special. Showcase events are infuriating because your opponent (train, air mattress thing) always have the direct line to the finish while you are required to make twists and turns, although it's still possible to beat them.  This game provides a lot of incentives to keep playing, like the daily forzathon challenges, which I just do without even looking at them. You also get random gifts in your message center, where they send you stuff along the lines of free cars, cash, or wheelspins. I think that it's a game of all time.",1,1,1,
1520,beautiful game,1,1,1,
1521,"Игра сама по себе веселая, красивая. Подойдет как для казуальных гонщиков, так и для хардкорных пилотов. Можно настраивать машины так как душе угодно. Можно играть как одному с ""балванчиками"", так и по сети с друзьями или рандомами. Чем запоминается игра? - Сменой сезонов. Каждую неделю происходит смена времени года и это не просто смена сезона, а полноценная смена. Не просто текстурки меняются, но и машина начинает вести себя немного иначе. Особенно зимой если машина заднеприводная и мощная, то вечные заносы обеспечены. Не знаю у многих такое или нет, я столкнулся с такой проблемой - во время игры экран в какой-то момент мигает один раз черным и потом картинка просто зависает, причем звук продолжает работать исправно. Возможно это из-за 2 мониторов, возможно мне так повезло, но в общем неприятный момент. Причем он рандомный. Может произойти через 5 минут, а может и не произойти за игровую сессию в 10 часов. Что еще не понравилось так это сетевые заезды, подбор игроков и загрузки порой бывают ужасно долгими. А как все загрузится, оказывается что все просто устали ждать и вышли. Дополнения интересные - особенно остров Фортуны. Красивые пейзажи как и в самой игре. А вот с ЛЕГО не все так хорошо как с Островом Фортуны. Спустя пару часов игры становится скучно, особенно если есть цель получить платину, для чего нужно выполнить все задания кубиков, который просто тьма. К сожалению разработчики положили болт на эту часть с выходом 5 Форзы Хорайзен. И теперь из-за это многие страдают и не могут получить заветную платину (это я про себя в том числе). Не возможно выполнить 1 достижение - Encore? - просто потому что игра неправильно считает. Выполняешь все возможные задания и в итоге получаешь 94% вместо 100%. Это оставило неприятный отпечаток в моей памяти об этой игре.

1526,"probably one of the best racing franchises i have ever had the luxury to play, for anyone that has ever played a horizon game you already know they are packed with tons of stuff to enjoy. the online is still pretty much alive in horizon 4 and you can easily take part in forzathon and other events.

for anyone that hasn't played one before:
- smash, find and collect signs and explore the roads in a large open world map.
- test your limits with speed zones, drifts, jumps & pr stunts.
- compete in various events.
- race online with PvP.
- collect luxury and rare cars.

few things to take into consideration, this one is based on England so you drive on the other side of the road, been from the UK doesn't bother me but if you are coming from horizon 2 to 4 you might need to adapt.

so based on playing all of the horizon games, i can honestly say you will not be ""completing"" this game in a hurry, i still have achievements unfinished on the previous titles (with the exception of the fast and furious version that i managed to 100%).",1,1,1,

1591,"ALLRIGHT, FOR PEOPLE CONSIDERING FH4 OR FH5, I HAVE PURCHASED BOTH AND THINK FH4 IS BETTER HANDS DOWN 

so now with less yelling.
I am a reasonably newer racing game player. Love em but never got into them all too much. Typically only downloaded what came free from subscription services etc.

I purchased FH5 first and LOVED IT. Didn't realize racing games had come far enough with customization, paint editing, sound and graphics. Had never played a Horizon game and bought it on a whim wanting to see what the buzz was about.

Fast forward 100 hours later, and I can say that I love FH5. But thats not what this review is about. 
Forza Horizon 4 is just a better game, and I can comfortably say this after my first 10 hours (of presumably 100+ in the future). 

What's better? (I got both Ultimates-worth of content)

Seasons/Weather: UK has actually dynamic weather. Snow, wet, dry. The temperatures in each season adjustment. Super cool thing that makes me do more than make 1-2 cars that drive all my races. Experimenting with new things feels warranted for some points over kitting my car out for each season, but thats me.

Events/Characters/Story: I thought FH5 was boring af, and super awkward with forced social interactions. I feel like with 4 they genuinely tried to write something and I appreciate it.

Cars: As of now, I think I like the cars from 4 better. More weird brands and cool rally vehicles. Don't notice a huge difference other than a large hole where Toyota/Lexus should be (yes theres some Toyotas but you gotta go buy at auction or wait for seasonal events, base roster literally has 1 supra LOL) thats my toyota bias though.

Map: HOLY SHIT UK is more fun to drive. It feels lived in and a lot more real. I mess up driving on the wrong side often, but these roads feel sensible. Without touching DLC I think the main map works better too because you work up each competition and unlock more stuff as you go. 

UI: The User Interface/Menus on this game have character and are jammed up at times with too much info, but coming from FH5 to this game, I understand what its all for and think its better that I know where to look for it. 

Driving feel: The cars suspension feel is just much better and feels responsive to choices I make within tuning.

Until FH5 gets more content and fills their giant map with actual things to do with a sense of progression (much like this game did) I think this game is the much better choice, and will probably always be cheaper.",1,0,0,

1678,"I've always been a fan of racing games but I had never tried RacingSim type of games. All the racing games I played were arcade games which are fun but you don't get the variety of cars and the experience you get here. 

Coming to the game, the game has a LOT of things to do, you will never be bored. I really like the fact that it doesn't have a progrssions system when you have to complete certain races to  move along the story line, as in Arcade games. I like dirt races so i can keep doing it and the game will throw more such races, which is amazing.

Cars:
Variety of cars, is just amazing. There are over 700 cars, most of which can be bought using credits from the Autoshop, but a lot of them are really rare and crazy expensive. You can still find them on the Aution House, but be sure to store a lot of credits. 

Gameplay:
Driving experience is very different. I couldn't try driving with a controller, but even the keyboard experience is not that bad. However if you can afford a controller get one. Highly recommended

DLC/PaidContent:
Coming to the DLCs, get the Ultimate Edition, Period! And buy the Hot Wheels Pack if you need it. And yes, wait for sale, it goes for around 67% discount on Sale. 

Community/OnlineContet:
The community is helpful, and there are a ton of resources online if you get stuck. I found the reddit sub the best. The game has stopped getting any new content but the online multiplayer and weekly contests will keep on coming for years, it's not going away anytime soon. Also if you plan on buying it get it before it is delisted from Steam/Windows Store because once that happends it's impossible to get it. 

Performance/Bugs/crashes: the game is surprisingly very well optimised, which is rare these days. Bugs are very rare, and although the game won't receive any new content the devs still fix minor bugs which is a good thing considering FH5 has been around for a while.

1767,"Lots of cars, the game is freeroam, awesome soundtrack, just plain awesome. As a quick introduction to the game, Forza Motorsport is the original series of Forza games. The Motorsport series is based around closed circuit racing ie: racing at a race track. Forza Motorsport is essentially Xbox/Microsoft's equivalent to Playstation/Sony's sim racer, the Gran Turismo series. The only difference is, Forza then made the Horizon series. Horizon is open world and simcade, this to me is a major plus. Gran Turismo currently as far as I'm aware, does not have an open world experience like this.

The general premise of Horizon is that there is a festival called the Horizon Festival that is set in some part of the world, to celebrate car culture. Horizon 4 takes place in a fictionalized UK, borrowing some real world locations/landmarks, and just mashing it all into one island.

The biggest plus with Horizon 4 is that it has all proper 4 seasons unlike you weirdos who live near the equator and don't experience snowy winters. Unlike Horizon 5 which takes place in Mexico, Horizon 4 has summer which is what you'd expect from summer, spring which is nice green scenery with loads of rain (typical UK?), autumn which is more rain, less green, more yellow and leaves, and finally...winter. Actual snow. Something that I never thought of as rare because I live in Canada, but to some of you who live in parts of the world with no snow, well....welcome to actual winter. Sadly it is the least active season because apparently all of you are scared of a little bit of snow, but this is currently the only Horizon game with all four seasons. Winter in Horizon 5 is NOT winter. If there is no snow, it is not winter. Simple. Sorry, not sorry. Every week is a season change, with that comes new (at this point its recycled) content. If only winter lasted for 7 days...unlike the miserable Canadian winters.

Overall the gameplay is fine, you can tune the difficulty to your liking against the Drivatars (AI racers using player names) which only affects how much money you earn so you don't always have to feel frustrated with Unbeatable Drivatars especially since the AI is notorious for defying physics despite driving lesser or seemingly equivalent cars than yours. My favourite is online. When in freeroam online, all players are ghosted, this way you can't be griefed while freeroaming unless you convoy up with friends or invite people to it. However that only applies to Freeroam (solo Freeroam specifically) or Forzathon Lives. Collision is turned on when you actually do races and events or as mentioned above with a convoy.

I mentioned Forzathon Live, what is that? Honestly one of my favourite things in this game. Every day, every hour, there is a Forzathon Live, every 50 minutes, a giant pink circle is placed on your map, you and all the people who want to participate, drive to the circle, after 10 minutes, Forzathon Live begins, you and all the players now drive to an area, and as a team, complete a common goal. For example, try and get a total speed of 10,000mph. How does this work? Well, there is a speed camera here, drive by it as fast as you can, you and all the participants need to do this until you reach 10,000mph. It sounds tough at first but with enough people and the right cars and strategy, its easy and fun. Meet new people, see cool cars, have fun driving in a non-competitive environment just doing car stuff. You do three rounds of this, and when you finish, you all get Forzathon points. 10, 20, 30 depending on how many rounds you manage to complete with the team, you get 20, 40, or 60 points if you have a specific house or VIP (which gives this house to you for free). These points can be used to buy rare cars in the Forzathon shop amongst other things. Always fun to do, non-competitive so you don't need to deal with sweaty tryhards, just have fun with the team, then you can resume with whatever you were doing before.

Overall this is a great game, yes there are known issues with the game like not being able to get 100% seasonal completion amongst other things unfortunately, no game is perfect, but compared to Horizon 5, this game is still very good. Remember, Horizon 5 takes place in Mexico, the winter in that game is not 1 winter, there is no snow. Also the car list is slightly different, some cars in this game, aren't in Horizon 5 so this is important to note. Overall I would say its a solid 8.5/10 for me. I don't feel like writing anymore since I normally write long ass reviews anyways. If you're wondering which edition to buy, personally I recommend Ultimate, it includes ALMOST all DLCs. The only things you miss are the Hot Wheels car pack (you need it in order to buy those cars in-game, but they can be driven in custom made challenge cards), Treasure Map (unlocks all map stuff, not really important), and I think the Mitsubishi pack which is free. There is also two additional Free DLCs but they're hard to find unfortunately (check or ask in Steam discussions). Either way I would recommend Ultimate for all the DLCs as you CAN'T buy the DLC cars from the Autoshow, and apparently not even the auction house unless you own said DLCs.

Final Note: Since the licensing for some of the cars in this game are almost expired, unfortunately this game will be delisted from Steam at some point, when, I don't know as its still unconfirmed and its also the first Forza game on Steam. This could be your last chance to experience Horizon 4 and what it has to offer before its gone and you only have Horizon 5 which won't have a 1 winter experience amongst other things that Horizon 4 has, so if you see it on sale, grab Ultimate Edition if you can.",1,1,1,

The book has selected his academic, interesting and readable works, essays and art talks from different periods to provide a collection for the readers. Lisiguang is a famous geologist in China and the founder of geomechanics.

He devoted his life to the research and teaching of paleontology, glaciology and Geomechanics, and wrote a large number of geological works. Crossing the horizon is one of his masterpieces.

After playing it a little on Game Pass on Xbox One I adored the choice of British landscapes and locations over the ""samey"" looks of American landscapes and locations. It felt very special and would remain in my memories for a long long while. I would then switch over to PS4 and then PS5 as my console of choice console. But still remembering the joys I had of this game. Then after losing access to the Xbox One and getting into PC gaming I made sure straight away to add Forza Horizon 4 to my wishlist so I could enjoy it once again. And then the day came that the game dropped massively in price I was quick to pounce on the Ultimate Edition of the game to snag all the small and big things that I had enjoyed on Game Pass years ago. So personally if you're in the market for a fun and enjoyable racing expience that can be as easy or as hard as you wish it to be, then I recommend giving Forza Horizon 4 a look at.",1,0,0,

2066,"Plus: most fun I had from a racing game for ages.
Great single player campaign, lost of interesting mini stories, lots of interesting characters
Great implementation of ideas
Great sound and music for your driving, the engine sounds dont sound that good though.
Great graphics, the game  handles well wtih my I7 and 1050ti
Massive variety of cars , unlike other games I dont get the sense its all the same with different exterior.
Ive played 40 hours so far and had the chance to participate in multiplayer events and I like it so far.
The map is Amazing! Its incredibly fun to drive around while choosing from a variety of cars.
The drift in this game is awesome, havent had that much fun since NFS underground 2
Unlike many games I played lately, it never feels like Im doing a chore and it never gets boring.

Cons: there are cheaters in this game but your hardly see them.
The engine sounds are ok for some cars and mosquito like for others. This might be the weakest point of Forza 4.
There are clothes in this game that seems kinda useless to me.
The characters perform dance moves , which is something that alienates me. Must be getting old.
There are some bugs that occur every now and then. But unfortunately the game crashes in rare occations. 4 times in 40 hours.
When you retry a mission after you finished and failed the loading screen might freeze for ever. This happens somewhat often but there is a way around it.
There is no chat in the game , only prefix messages like ""your awesome"" but you can use 4 of them at a time. Also its hard to add a friend in game, no very social for an online game.",1,1,1,

2233,"I'm a casual, not a hardcore racer. Every so often I like to let off a bit of steam and hopefully win a race. This was my first exposure to Forza and I was pleased. There's a lot of variety in cars and race events. You don't need to be PC Racer to get accomplishments and make progress. If you lose a few races, it downgrades the competition a bit until you find your feet and then builds up the difficulty again. The rewind feature is great for when you make a little mistake on an otherwise great race. Just rewind a little and start the section again.  I like the online community presence. It makes it feel like you might be playing against real people, even though I think the drivatars in solo mode are AI. You need an Xbox account but if you have a Microsoft account, then you already have this.

Overall, this is a fun racing game to dip in and out of and make progress through without feeling like you've got to give it blood, sweat and tears.",1,1,1,

2313,"NOTE: BUY THE ULTIMATE EDITION EXCEPT YOU WANT TO BE FORCED TO SPEND FAR MORE THAN YOU SHOULD BE

Almost un-recommend, refund, and buying a gamepass soon when i got an XBOX Series S or a better PC due to technical difficulties, but i managed to make it work in less than an hour.
Buying this in 10 dollar mark makes me regret or made up that last year i purchased The Crew 2 in belief that The Crew 2 ran better on my PC due to its lesser graphics.
However...
This game is miles better in ways to treat the players right.
First, in comparison to The Crew 2 (- indicate cons, + indicate plus):
-Not being set in the USA, clearly which one has the larger world?
-No controllable bikes and planes. There is only minimal number of off-road.
-Far less amount of character customization, locked behind the spinwheel, which, even if doesn't consume money, still takes a long time to progress.
+So many cars that doesn't get locked into a (real money) paywall or lengthy grindwall. 
+Increased modes of accessibility
+A navigator that actually helps instead of condescendingly repeating the same advice
+No nagging, annoying, or condescending characters. So much that you might forget they're existed if you beaten all the events.
+Better handling, though that cars handle differently is something you need to get used to.
+More ways to customize your car
+You can change your character avatar (though like The Crew 2, it's preset only) even after the game in progress 
+ You can play offline after registering for the first time.
+Microtransactions only come in packs and the ultimate edition is pretty cheap, like, 10 dollars during sale (Regional Pricing Apply)
+Little to no stutters, though the framerate in average is lower (i'm running in a potato)
+Ability to blueprint and customize events, i.e. create your own events. Something that The Crew 2 conspicuously lacks.
+Better graphics and Playground listens (such as there is no ""paint splatter"" or ""milk spill"" snow)
+Season did not transition abruptly and instantly, but throughout story and (supposedly, after you beat the first year Horizon level up missions) weekly.

Now for a real review, i can say that for the almost-100 hours i play (the first half hours is when it doesn't work) the game: 
+Doesn't crash too much (though random i can play 6+hours with no CTD but sometimes 1-2 hours and its CTD) and only stutters very minimally on me. (and this is me running on potato)
+Coming from somebody who played a lot of Need for Speed games, the car handling of Forza Horizon 4 is the BEST. For all these years apart from GTA there's Forza Horizon 4 in terms of satisfying handling (and i have played games like GRID and Ridge Racer mind you)
+Very minimal rubber-banding. So if you just lost then tweak the difficulty or car tuning or get good.
+Route Creator, which allow you to play and earn by your creativity. However....
-With the exception of the one-car Super7 events, you can't create barriers and objects like crowd viewing benches that are exclusive to Horizon-made events. EventLab in the 5th Forza Horizon is said to adding those, but i haven't played Forza Horizon 5.
-Lack of interior mods, like how to get rid unused seats because you never sit with others.
-Try NOT to use Assist once you acquire decent winning streaks. As the steering and braking might screw your ability to take advantage of shortcuts and off road passes. Later on you'll need to turn off Stability and Traction control and learn to control spins in order to either drift effectively or maximize your car's ability.
-You might (initially) need to use assists on ""Showcase"" (boss ""battles"") events given that it isn't car-against-car racing duels. Later when there's a ""remix"", assists could hinder you from using the full potential of your car.
-Night as it turns out, far faster than it should be only around 3-5 minutes (the polar opposite of the also Microsoft-published State of Decay games). You can mitigate it by setting up night racing events.

2) Full controller support works fine. Pair up that old Xbox controller and have some fun.
3) Runs pretty well from a spinning hard disk. (2TB WD Black 2003FZEX for reference). SSD recommended for best results, as well as *AT LEAST* 32GB of DDR3-2400 RAM running in dual-channel mode. Any less RAM and you risk running out of memory whilst loading or playing the game. Any slower and you'll have stuttery gameplay. Also pair it up with an i7-4790K or better as to avoid bottlenecking the hardware. And I shouldn't have to mention this, but make sure that the SSD that your Steam library lives on is indeed a SATA III 6Gbps SSD and is connected to a SATA III 6Gbps port on your motherboard.
4) I can't think of anything else to say. Go buy the game and play it!",1,1,1,
2434,"It's a casual, open world, seasonal, arcadey car game... where you can cut straight through gps-routes in plenty of races and immediately bounce(literally without crashing/dying) to the finish line like an absolute clown. The cars are nice though.

I'd get this only to collect and maybe make rudimentary tuning setups to cars. You make credits very fast and you'll even earn cars through roulette spins (lootboxes after every good race). It sounds cheap, but you also get 20+ gifted nice cars once the open world opens up to you. Sell them if you want if you want to save for a Ferrari, Pagani, Koenigsegg, Maserati, or whatever 1 million + dollar dream vehicle you'd like to drive.

In the first day or so when I started, I found the auction house where you can buy cars and almost immediately earned enough for a 2002 Corvette, 2006 Corvette, a Mustang, Toyota Supra, Plymouth GTO, An old Beetle, A Dodge Viper, and a Porsche. Now... I don't know about anyone else, but when I was young I had to unlock these vehicles at later vehicle stages in older racing games (PGR2) and I felt set here. I don't care about the grind right now, cause I have all my old dream cars and nice cars are just raining down on me since this game is so dang easy. Yeah, I'm on my controller and I'd rather play this in a sim mode with a wheel and pedal... but cruising is still fun with just a controller.

Anyways, PC-M&K-lover or not, plug in that plug-n-play xbox one controller and enjoy having supercars rain down on you as you earn them in the dream cars of your childhood. Horizon 4 is casual arcade fun where its just nice to look at (and yes a w&p system is a 1000% better on this. I've seen the videos of the ffeedback. A good wheel is all I need for this to be perfect).",1,0,0,

Pro:
Hands down, this is a really fantastic game when it runs. It is interesting, it is enjoyable, it just offers a lot of fun. Hard to see what can not be liked on this title.

Con:
The game starts up well till you can press enter to load the game itself. However I can't get through that point anymore. 
In the beginning worked on hours to figure out how to run the game, after it was running finally and I was happy. Played around 12 hours or even more. Then again, the game no longer wants to run, spent hours time to time when I had patience and time, but no luck. Not to mention the ""what to do if your game crashes"" actually asks you to stop and kill every possible app (logitech, sonic studio, and so on), windows and 3rd party firewall, antivirus. I've even opened all port I could find on internet related this game. 
 Bought a great game, but I feel cheated. Having a high end pc and not able to run a game which I bought.
I would highly recomment to check out the newest Forza, maybe that has half of this issues. This feels like a russian rulette. It is either runs well or you just spend hours and hours to figure out what else you could try to run the game.
UPDATE arrived to game, checking several way if finally it runs again... but no luck for me. Hope it might help for others... (2022.06.09.)",0,1,0,

A great example of an open-world driving game.

Vehicle selection has plenty of variance, from modern hyper cars to racing semi trucks and plenty in between, Whether or not you like dodging traffic in street races, hitting the dirt in rally races, forgoing roads entirely in cross-country jaunts or quarter-mile drag racing, there's plenty for you to do.

Visual parts customization is limited per-car, but the livery customization is very in-depth and you can really go to town with it. You can even share your created liveries (with some limitations) with other players, and you are even rewarded in-game if your creations are used by other players.

Difficulty is more-or-less up to the player, with rewards tied in so that the harder the player makes the game, the more money they earn from events.

The game is very stable and runs well (I have experienced a few CTDs, but they were almost certainly due to the fact that my graphics card is the only aspect of my rig that doesn't meet the Recommended Specs)",1,0,0,

It has an active community and stuff, but they really throw a lot of the fancy cars out as soon as you start playing, which kind of ruins the whole idea of ""earning"" the cars you want to have. I'm not sure if this is a common thing or not, this is my first Forza game after all, but it felt like there was stuff going on and im not a part of it. A lack of linear progression or a contained storyline is what you're getting here, and if its your thing, you'll love it.",1,1,1,

In 4K, every detail looks sharp, from the stone walls you'll bust through every time you take a bad angle on a turn to the dials on your car's dash when you take a tour of the interior in your garage. At 60 frames per second, the more fluid animation intensifies the sense of speed that builds when you shift into high gear, whether you're gracefully drifting around sharp turns on Edinburgh's streets or launching off a ramp in the English countryside. The Xbox One X gave us a glimpse of next-gen gaming by allowing us to choose between these two technical advancements, but the Series X gives us the complete picture by combining them to make games that are incredibly detailed and smooth.",1,0,0,

Cars feel good to drive (when you have them spec'd into grip and have stability turned on). All this said, there is plenty to do in this game, but it does get stale after awhile. I am 50 hours in, I have cleared all the actual races, but have barely touched the ""story"" missions. I find them just... Kinda boring?

There's also a festival playlist each week which is always fun to go through and complete to win prizes. I ended up buying the Lego Speed Champions DLC and Fortune Island DLC, and they're both great add-ons. This is an incredible game with endless replayability!",1,1,1,
2918,This game does not work very well on a high end game PC.  It is mostly designed for Xbox/tv use with a game controller.  Some steering wheel setups will work but not even close to the physics in Assetto Corsa.  Also I have not had any luck in storing my achievements on a sync with Steam Cloud which makes progress impossible - don't waste your money buying if you use a high end PC setup.,0,0,1,

2998,car go vroom vroom. My first forza game and its now one of my favorite games i've ever played. Been playing this game everyday since i bought it and the amount of times I lost track of time. The graphics is just beautiful and somewhat relaxing to just drive around. One thing I wished forza would have is to allow purchasing or redoing old challenges from past events. Being a newer player I found out I missed out on some seasonal car rewards. Besides that I have no complaints and looking forward to picking up FH5,1,1,1,

Starting the game form 0 was rather confusing with many things not explained well - like the devs expected players to come from FH3 or forza series.

Other people have their own views but I can't be bothered having to go through a vast tutorial to learn about breaking points, apexes, brake balance and everything else. I want a game where I can have some fun.

Forza Horizon 4 does exactly what I want. You can pretty much jump in a car and start racing. But it also does the other stuff. If you want to be able to barrel-roll your car three times and still be able to carry on racing, it will do that. On the other hand, if you want your car to be undriveable after a few fairly minor knocks, it can do that too. You can tweak your balance, brakes, gears and god knows what else, or you can leave everything on the defaults. You can race against AI that never makes a mistake or you can pick opponents that seem to struggle with all the different peddles.

I'm sure there will be those for whom the slightly madcap elements in the game will be a put-off, but for me it's simple fun and I love it.",1,1,1,

3144,"Pro’s
    • Overwhelming selection of cars to choose from; your childhood favourites are most likely there
    • Graphically gorgeous
    • Very good optimisation
    • Stacks of things to do
    • Very customisable races
    • Cars have a tremendous level of customisation available
    • The map is sufficiently-sized, and enjoyable to explore
    • Has a unique rewind system; allowing you to immediately tackle a corner again without having to start the race from scratch
    • Very good level of difficulty customisation

Con’s
    • AI behaviour in racing is on-rails. AI choses whether it obeys the laws of physics depending on what position you are and at what point in the race. Makes racing... uncomfortable.
    • Game launches advertising clips in-game, and forces you to sit through them on first view.
    • The dialogue is pretty terrible, unless you love your ego being stroked. It happens a LOT, and you can’t skip it.
    • The only character customisations available are clothing and poses, all of which you can acquire only per chance through the Wheel Spin system, or of course in-game purchases. You end up stuck with a character that is unlikely to represent you.
    • Slot-machine style of rewards (that happen frequently).
    • Many of the rewards are things you probably don’t want; like poses for your character you will never use, cars you’ll never drive, and clothing you’d rather burn
    • Not without bugs
    • The audio level cap is pretty low
    • You can’t mute the in-game music
    • Game was not designed with H-shifting manual drivers in mind. It works, but you can’t stall the car, rev the engine in neutral, and the engine revs if you’re coasting downhill in neutral

Forza Horizon 4 is a fun game. It has all the ingredients for an expansive, truly immersive driving experience, but suffers from pretty huge character flaws that yank you out of that rich experience. If you can tolerate/forgive these misgivings, you will have a lot of fun... until the game inevitably crashes on you.",1,1,1,

3183,"The game mechanics are very good; much improved over the previous installment, I'd say. Tuning works realistically, and the courses are good... There is decent customization of your vehicles and there are tonnes of great cars to choose from. There is also a great auction menu that allows you to unload unwanted cars and pick up new cars for great prices. Practically every other aspect of the game is shite. The characters are shallow, the jokes are lame, the events are meaningless and often downright stupid. (The race against a fighter jet comes to mind) The game is constantly trying to shove paid content down your throat and there's too much focus on non-car related elements like victory dances and clothing for your avatar, all of which I could happily do without, There's a bit of douchyness, which seems to plague driving games now-a-days mainly centred around avatars, although nowhere near the amount of douchyness of a modern Need for Speed title. I, like many other Windows users am also experiencing regular crashes every hour or two. Menu music cannot be turned off or down, and in game music can only be turned off completely by selecting ""no radio"" in the radio menu... Another thing I could do without.",1,0,0,

The gameplay and music is excellent here, and the season changes make everything so much more diverse. Also, I love all of the car customization and online features too. Hell, if you want to relax and free roam around a large map, you can!

Personally I got the base game on sale, and I've already played the demo many times and the Xbox gamepass version for a while too. I'll certainly buy all of the DLC before the game comes off of Steam.",1,1,1,

Dodge challenger RT sounds like a straight pipe v6. Other than that this game would've been perfect, but I'm gonna upgrade to 5.

3351,"I must reveal that first, I tested this game from an unofficial release from somewhere over the rainbow, I always test games this way to see how well they perform on my hardware, then if the performance is there and I like the game, I add it to my steam wishlist and wait for a sale, then I grab it, this wasn't the first Forza I played, but the last one was quite an old one, I last played this game franchise on my X360, my console came with Forza Motorsports 2 in its bundle and I got hooked to it right away, till my X360 decided to die with the infamous RROD (the good old days). Back to the reason I didn't get any other Forza, is they were exclusive to Xbox consoles and I never replaced my X360 due to some tight budget issues at the time, or they weren't on steam, as simple as that, I don't want to have multiple games on different platforms, except for some very special cases from one I won't name here.

Ok, I only played 5hrs on this one and I love it to the max, except when it does CTD without any explanations, even in middle of a race or anywhere on the map, its just bam, back to desktop, all my drivers are up to date, everything should be fine. But I'll keep playing, I love old cars, I must be the only one that drives the old stuff and not the fastest cars of the game, I love classic cars and there's a lot of them in that game, for sure they won't win many races, but the fun is to drive them around.",1,1,1,

Muting other players with annoying sounds is too difficult
Removed the photo challenge
Apparently the wheel set up is not working, thank you for saving me a couple hundred euros. 
A chance of losing the save of all of your progress
The game is being updated to a worse state, yet not content-wisely updated at all
70 euros is WAY too much, so the 80% discount is minimum price you should get this game for

3400,"Are you into cars? Are you poor af that you don't have enough money to buy FH5 and that expensive steering wheel, pedals, and shifter? If so then this game is for you! 

Kidding aside. This game is friendly enough that you can race properly using just a keyboard. The physics is good and there is a lot of things to do and unlock. You can literally waste hours just driving around the map because of how good the graphics, scenery and driving dynamics are. 

The cars are awesome and so is the community. While cruising around sometimes you'll have a random join you and there are frequent drag races that you can just randomly join at the highway section of the map.",1,0,0,

Forza Horizon 4 is a fun driving simulator very similar to Forza Motorsport, with one exception. Instead of tracks, you drive on countryside roads, city streets and even sandy beaches! The Horizon Festival requires the best drivers from all over the world to participate, and you are one of them! With some very cool features such as Drivatars, scalable difficulties and some great radio stations, this game is an absolute treat!
There isn't really a story with these Horizon games, other than its a festival where competing in and winning races gains you infamy and money which allows you to participate in more races and buy cooler stuff. With The Festival going to the USA, Italy/France and Australia, its time the festival visited the UK! The map, while not to scale, includes some of the iconic British landscapes, such as the lake district, the moor and Edinburgh! Its amazing how much detail each village has, and the development team clearly put in a lot of effort to get it all right!
The main changes from previous games is that drivers now actually appear live in your game. In previous games you could create a convoy which consisted of AI Drivatars, as you would never really share an instance with other players - it was mostly offline. Another change is to skills. Instead of now collecting skills for your progress overall and shared them across cars, you now have to build up skills for each car. Skills have been made much easier to earn though.
The music is also really well crafted into the game, with each race playing a fitting looping track for the duration of the race. New and well established artists are featured on every radio station.
Overall, Forza Horizon 4 is a lot of fun and allows for some crazy stunts, but that's what this game is for! It really is a one of a kind genre, but requires some time to get into, as the tutorials and beginning just take so long. The new Horizon Stories feature were amazing, and even allows you to learn something about British automotive History... and earn some credits along the way!
Forza Horizon 4 gets an 8/10.

3453,"⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ 5/5
One of the best racing game. There's a lot to do including weekly events, stories, and speed/drift/stunt challenges. Definitely recommended.
[hr][/hr]
[b] CARS:  [/b] 
- lots of cars to choose from. iirc, it's 475 unique cars excluding DLC one.
- whole lot of community-crafted tune. so even if you're bad at tuning, you can just use one of the well-crafted build.
- tons of decals. You can also use decals made by other user as well.

[b] GAMEPLAY:  [/b] 
- visual driving line. they'll guide you on where you should be driving and when you should brake. 
- rewind system. made a mistake? hit a tree? use rewind! it'll take you back a few second so you can get another attempt at it.
- bots are not too stubborn and can't be beaten too easily. but you can adjust the difficulty from ""unbeatable""(not really) to completely new-racer difficulty.
- arcade/realistic control. it has a great mix between these two. of course you can turn on full simulator mode too. drifting is not too bad as well, though you might take a while to get used to it.
- auction house.
- pretty big open-world. and the areas are not bland/empty as well.

[b] CONTENT:  [/b] 
- weekly event. win it and earn another rare car or clothing.
- stunt challenge. they're all around the map. including speed zone, speed cam, drifting zone, and 'jumping cliff'.
- stories. The game has stories for each NPC, and they excel at different stuff. Some are about drifting. some are about speeed. and some are about the classic cars. this really add up to your playtime.
- player-made challenges.
- the communities are not dying. even though forza horizon 5 is out, there's still a lot of people playing this daily.

[b] THE CONS:  [/b]   
- terrible save system. the game has an autosave system, but not a good one. I guess it works fine if you have high-end PC. but if you don't, your game might freeze while saving. and when you restart, pray that your progress is still there. You won't lose your save though, that's for sure.
- require a pretty good PC and internet.",1,1,1,

3456,"Personally I think FH4 has way better reward system than FH5 in a sense that you don't have to grind as much to get a new car (since cars are easier to obtain in wheelspin). Somehow making the reward system works that way doesn't make the game becoming more boring due to the fact that you're gonna be able to try cars that you wouldn't even consider buying from the shop directly, not to mention the weekly forzathon challanges also rewards you with cars rather than what the FH5 gives which is an in-game currency. Overall both game have amazing graphic and great feeling when you're driving, but for the rewards system alone I would recommend FH4 more than FH5",1,0,0,

I'm playing with the Logitech G29 and shifter, however the steering cuts out, and even after driver update, restarting multiple times, reinstalling the game etc. Nothing was fixed, and apparently many PC users struggle with this, which has been ongoing for 3 years. Terrible service received, told me to look at a reddit thread which had no answer or solution, only people complaining about the issue, and referred to a website with a 404 page. Then they locked the thread. Game is essentially unplayable if you happen to have this issue.

Another note, steering and force feedback from the wheel is terrible. It's an arcade game striving for 0 steering wheel support, if you have a steering wheel, turn all force feedback off, otherwise the steering wheel will force you into oversteer (theres no driving straight for some reason), would not recommend to anyone except for little kids who wanna play a car game.",0,0,1,

- When it does work, none of the buttons configured work. 
- I have the latest drivers and firmware for the wheel.

3747,"Great game - many caveats if played on Linux

The good:
 - Very fun driving mechanics
 - Open world
 - Beautiful graphics
 - Good voice narration
 - Great variety of music
 - Excellent performance, even with Proton overhead

The not-so-good:
 - Many, *many* crashes on Linux. If you play this with proton, be sure to:
    - Set any dynamic optimization off
    - Keep controllers disconnected until you are in the world
    - Accept that crashing is still inevitable and it's a miracle that it works on Linux in the first place.
 - Required Microsoft account which will eventually be suspended if you do not 2FA
 - AI can be ridiculously easy or ridiculously difficult on the same level depending on conditions
 - I wouldn't purchase it if it weren't on a sale. I count DLC as part of the game. Are you kidding me? $100 for the ultimate edition? Same issues with FH5.

Final thoughts:
For never intended on being ran on Linux with Proton, performance is surprisingly decent. It's a great open-world arcade racing game. If you want to have a relaxing cruise on the freeway or fight your way to the top in races, this game has you covered. If you buy it on the occasional sale, it is a bargain. Just beware the Microsoft account lock. You will be unable to play the game *at all* if you don't have one.

3789,"I'm a Forza fan since the original XBOX instalment way back when, but due to life and time I really haven't played any of the modern games much. I saw this on sale and bought it to see what the new titles are like. All I can say is 'wow!' - if you're a racing fan at all this is the game for you.

The thing that appealed to me in the originals was the track / circuit progression and realistic physics and modification systems. These things are all still here, except instead of navigating through a menu for your tracks you're driving to them in the English countryside. Seasons change week-to-week and the landscape and tracks reflect this - winter is a challenge as there's knee-deep snow most places so not the best time to go and try to set speed records... although it makes for very fun offroad races.

The actual game introduction (first 5 hours or so) is a little bit painful with lots of cutscenes and adds for the DLC's, but they go away eventually. At no time do you feel like you don't know what to do which is a bonus. The menu and mapping systems are good and you can navigate 'GPS style' to a destination, event, challenge etc.

There are a heap of ways to play this game. I got used to the landscape by doing Speed Camera and Jump challenges, which are just areas on the map where you go fast to break a speed camera record or try and get a long jump from an elevated area. They're well marked and let you get a feel for the cars, roads and landmarks while building some currency and bonuses along the way before any real racing. Highly recommended!

The tracks and challenges vary and are always fresh-feeling. I particularly liked the 'stuntman' type series which sees you performing stunts of various types against the clock, a really nice touch and very British feeling.

TLDR? This is a great game. I'm nowhere near finishing it at 40+ hours in and from all accounts theres plenty of action yet to come... and I don't even have the DLC's or car packs. Grab it on sale, you won't regret it.",1,1,1,

3810,"In my first impression, it’s one of the best racing games I've ever played. The graphics and sound are attractive and the overall game-play of the game is well done.

I have to say that I don't really like to play racing games because of the feeling that these types of games are hard to play and I thought I had to know the different types of cars that each car would be difficult to drive but it wasn't what I thought like that. When I opened my eyes it was a game that didn't use a lot of difficult controls (I played with a keyboard) and it was very easy to understand.

Within the game's large map, there are missions, each of which includes regular racing. Missions that limit the use of cars and missions that are racing with something that it is unlikely to compete with players in various fields. It was very creative and made me prefer to find a weird car to use in the field rather than trying to get a nice one.

I came to play this game because my friend invited me to play. Another reason I decided to buy this game is because it can be played with my friends in a small party online, it's easy to create and doesn't need to load a lot of scenes while connecting. So it's recommended if you're partying with your friends who want to play games together.

If you are hesitant to play I can assure you it's worth it because besides the first play experience that made me really obsessed with this game. And yet to mention the realism of the physics or the virtual reality of the game that I might not be expert enough to say. But it made me feel that this game was really good.

Hope my review will be of some help in your decision.",1,1,1,

3831,I know Horizon 5 is out and soon this game will be unplayable but this game is amazing and I will always love this game for the happiness that it gave to me in a dark time in my life. Solid game play and beautiful graphics paired with pretty decent physics make this game a worthy contender for the racing genre the only issue i have is the sparse vehicle customization that is better found in need for speed.

3921,"As someone who has never been much into racing games or cars in general, I was quite surprised by how much I enjoyed my time in this game. I've had a blast exploring the open world and trying to collect and complete everything. My experience hasn't been without issues however, and there are some serious problems with this game that have put a bit of a damper on my experience.

Although I haven't had much experience playing racing games, I found the mechanics and controls to be very intuitive and after getting used to the terrible menu and extremely busy map (more on that later), I found myself enjoying driving the various vehicles almost right away. Although I was initially the most interested in collecting the hidden signs around the map and completing the various speed and distance challenges, I quickly found myself enjoying almost all the different races and challenges just as much. This game also has hundreds of different cars and has quite a bit of customization for each of them, allowing all sorts of different upgrades and paint/decals, which was a bit overwhelming at first, but was really cool to play around with once I got the hang of it. This game is also really good at giving you lots of difficulty options, so you can customize the game to be easier or harder if you'd like (for the most part). The game also looks fantastic, especially given that the game runs very well on even low end hardware (usually). I was surprised when my friend with a weaker gaming laptop had absolutely no trouble running the game.

Unfortunately, this game is not without issues, and there are some serious problems with this game that must be mentioned:
[list]
[*] This game has tons of strange bugs. The initial loading video always has the wrong resolution, the narrator is always incorrectly enabled on the starting screen, statistics often don't update properly, the way NPC vehicles drive (especially when racing online) is bizarrely jittery, inconsistent, and sometimes downright broken, navigating down in the menu sometimes doesn't work, cutscenes sometimes show the wrong car, races sometimes disappear from the map, menu items are sometimes incorrectly locked, the car often clips through the map when reloading story missions, the audio rarely slows down and becomes extremely distorted, the game sometimes softlocks when finishing a race, the game starts to slow down if you have it running for too long, it rarely doesn't save properly, and rarely the game crashes completely. Thankfully almost all of these are somewhere between uncommon and extremely rare, and most of them weren't very severe, but the sheer number of different bizarre issues I kept encountering did become annoying after a while.
[*] The menu in this game is terrible, with multiple tabs containing tiles of varying sizes, many of which are never explained, are locked without explanation, change constantly, or are duplicated on multiple pages. It is a pain to navigate, very hard to learn, and is a great example of how not to design a menu.
[*] The game is initially extremely overwhelming. The game rapidly bombards you with tons of different races and challenges when you start, many complicated screens have lots of options that are never explained, and the convoluted menu that was previously mentioned certainly doesn't help. This gives the game quite the initial learning curve which can be extremely daunting for new players.
[*] Public multiplayer matches sometimes take an extremely long time to load. I'm not sure why this is, but there are some parts of the game (such as online adventure or sandbox games) that are difficult or impossible to do because the matches either take forever to load or just never actually load (I was never patient enough to figure out which).
[*] The game shows you occasional advertisements in-game for the DLC you don't own. I never had this issue as I purchased all the DLC immediately, but this was quite annoying for my friends who didn't.
[*] Multiplayer is locked behind the completion of the initial seasons, which serves as a bit of an tutorial/introduction to the game, but is quite long, so you can't play with friends until you've played the game for a number of hours, which was a bit frustrating initially, especially since this isn't clearly indicated anywhere.
[*] The weekly weather changes are neat, but they change the road conditions pretty drastically, which makes some challenges far harder, especially in the winter season, so it is a bit frustrating to know that there are just some weeks where all your times/scores are probably going to be lower, and races/challenges are all going to be harder.
[*] There are a few parts of the game that aren't possible to complete anymore (such as the Mixer challenges or items unlocked by the discontinued Forza Hub app).
[/list]
Although I did still highly enjoy my time with this game, these issues put a bit of a damper on the experience and did cause quite a bit of frustration at some points. Thankfully I still had a good experience with this game as a whole and none of these are serious enough to prevent me from recommending this game.

[b]TL;DR[/b] This is a fantastic racing game with a great open world, good mechanics, fantastic customization, tons of content, great visuals, and good performance. Unfortunately, it is also quite overwhelming and has a wicked learning curve, and it is plagued by tons of strange bugs and bad design decision (like the terrible menu, in-game DLC advertisements, locking multiplayer behind a long introduction segment, etc.). While these issues weren't enough to keep me from having a great experience with this game, you should definitely weigh these for yourself and determine if these issues would keep you from enjoying this game or not. If you think you'd still enjoy the game despite these issues, then I'd highly recommend you pick this game up.",1,1,1,

Filety namoczyć w mleku z dodatkiem soli i pieprzu (ewentualnie z dodatkiem kilku plastrów cebuli) przez ok. 2 godziny lub dłużej jeśli mamy czas (można też zostawić do namoczenia na noc).
Wyjąć filety z mleka i osuszyć je papierowymi ręcznikami. Doprawić solą (niezbyt dużo, bo zalewa z mleka była już solona) i pieprzem, obtoczyć w mące, następnie w roztrzepanym jajku, a na koniec w bułce tartej.
Na patelni rozgrzać klarowane masło (ok. 1/2 cm warstwa) lub smalec. Smażyć partiami po 2 kotlety, na większym ogniu, po 2 minuty z każdej strony. Następnie zmniejszyć ogień i smażyć jeszcze po ok. 3 minuty z każdej strony. Przetrzeć patelnię papierowym ręcznikiem i powtórzyć z kolejną partią, na świeżym tłuszczu.

My complaints have to do with Steam, Microsoft, and Proton. I just recently switched to Manjaro and repurchaed the game on Steam. My Windows version was purchased from the Microsoft Store. While the game runs decently under Proton, none of my awards, money, houses, etc transferred from XBox. 3 years of accumulated stuff is gone! I had to start from rock bottom. Luckily, this is a fun game!!! I don't know if this is a Steam or Microsoft issue.

Also, I've noticed the wheelspins aren't displaying under Proton. Everything else works fine with Proton 5.

Game has tons of content to unlock, tons of locations to visit and race around in, and really accessible gameplay that can be as easy or as hard as you want it to be (PSA for casual players who prefer arcade gameplay and handling over sim: don't overtune/overupgrade your cars).

Another thing that I like about this game is that the AI doesn't cheat. There's no rubberbanding, and at the easier AI levels, you will see the CPU cars make mistakes (it's fun seeing sportscars overshoot their turns and tumble around on offroad tracks.)  So if you get good at the game, you can feel it instead of the game trying to introduce faux difficulty by giving AI cars unfair advantages.",1,0,0,

4124,"The game location is set in the Great Britain, which the game has simulated beautifully with details. The city looks great, the countrysides, mountainsides and other landmarks look fantastic. The sound suits the game well, especially at the introduction sequence to the game. They are wide variety of car types/spec/brands (over 100 with DLCs at beginning and over 730 in total, so you will most likely find your car there). The control feel casual but not much of an arcade racing like NFS, for me it's  fun to drive and it's addictive once you master it. The game as of time of review is out of support now but they are many players in online server and there are seasonal events awaiting -- rewarding with rare/expensive cars. Only cons I found is the car sound feel a bit compressed and missing some of small detail with doesn't match its photorealistic graphic. and.. In England, We are driving on the left (like many of Asian countries) -- not a problem for me, just FYI. Recommend buying this game on discount. For full price I recommend buying its sequel -- Forza Horizon 5 since the game retaining the photorealistic graphic, superb soundtracks, significantly better engine sound, more cars and still getting updates from the developer.",1,1,1,

4231,"Long review below:

I do recommend this game. It is quite extensive, pleasant to play, quite nice if you want to just relax. There are numerous pros and very little cons, which I will list below. First of all, I need to say this is my first FH series game and I am impressed. 

Pros:
- The world is amazing. It is big, with excellent detail, there are all sorts of roads, with different grip, etc. 
- Changing seasons is a nice feature. While Autumn and Spring are pretty much the same, Winter is just amazing. Having a dirt race on snow is simply great. 
- Humongous amount of cars. I've never seen another game with so many cars in it. There are 752 cars... Just amazing. You can go for an old classical car, a nice rally car from the 70s or 80s, any well known 90s car, or a large amount of cars afterwards. Its as you please. Not to mention how many classes there are - rally cars, track race, gt, supercars, hypercars, trucks, buggies, suvs, I'm sure I'm missing a lot others.
- Auction House - this is an absolutely brilliant feature. You can buy cars from other players. They can be listed for bidding at a low amount and a purchase price at a higher. I got 99% of my cars that way. You can either buy or sell your cars that way. 
- Race types. As there are a lot of types of cars, there are also a lot of types of races. My favorites are off-road either with rally cars or trucks. 
- Also about races, this is not the regular 10-hour gameplay game. I have played for 35 hours so far and am not sure if I have reached the 50% yet. Most probably not. 
- Events - those are nice, based on the season, where you need to comply with specific requirements to gain rewards. 
- In-game achievements. Well, not exactly achievements, but there are those nice zones, where you need to get to a certain completion in order to get 1,2 or 3 stars. For example in speed traps, you need to pass through a speed camera with a certain speed. Or there are jumps from which you jump and need to achieve a specific fly distance. I was thinking initially that those are made just for the fastest cars, as most of the starting ones were on normal roads. But no, you can have some which are on dirt and supercars simply cannot accelerate that much on that surface. 
- I am sure there is a huge amount of other Pros, but let's not make this review waaaay to long.

Cons:
- Menus are quite difficult at start. It takes some time to learn to navigate them.
- While music should be listed as a plus, as there are several radios providing all sorts of music styles (including classical), the songs are too limited and at a certain time become a nuisance. 
- Bugs. While there are not many, there are some bugs from time to time, which are a bit unpleasant. I mean this is a Microsoft game and it is normal to have bugs. 
- Speaking of Microsoft, one of the main issues I got was that the Auction House became greyed-out. According to everything I read, you need to fill your age (which I had already) and ensure all options in your Xbox account are enabled (for whatever reason). So it took me about 2 days of troubleshooting to fix this myself as the support was not really helpful. 

Hope this helps.",1,1,1,

4238,"I think Forza Horizon 5 looks better, plays better, has better AI and UI, and the map is also more fun to drive around in, however Forza Horizon 4 is still an amazing racing experience as someone who's just a big fan of car collections and racing games. I played this game for a long while back in like, idk, mid last year? maybe early last year? when I first signed up for game pass. and it was fun but I just like owning games better there's just something so empty-feeling about playing games on a subscription service this game genuinely feels better to play after buying it now
less guilty about the progress I've made you know. though you could argue that that's just sunk cost fallacy stuff
anyway it's a good game. if you like forza horizon at all why not get this. if you like cars and collections and somewhat arcadey driving with tons of difficulty and accessibility options why not play this!
It is pretty expensive but it goes on less for sale than 5 does at the moment AND it does have the lego expansion which is pretty fun (what 5's expansions will be I don't yet know though I hope it's as good as LEGO stuff or better)

i don't know what's the problem i am very sure it's not on my end since i have solid hardware to run it and it's the only game that does this , so that's why it doesn't deserves the recommendations .... non stop game crashes just ruins everything and makes it unplayable .",0,0,1,

4445,100% honest review here and I don't normally write reviews for games I dislike. i really really wanted to like Forza Horizon 4. it looks pretty and the cars look amazing but the game play feels so bad i cant stand more then 5 minutes of trying a race. i've tried to tune my steering wheel to make everything not feel chunky and it doesn't help. I make one little mistake and i'm doing doughnuts and the whole race is over and gone. maybe i'm just bad i don't know. I can play other race games just fine. i haven't even gotten into the multiple crashes into about 30 min of playing the game. i don't understand what is causing this. I turn down graphics and still crash. id honestly give this game another try if i could play longer but with all the cards pulling against me and i cant. I regret getting the higher priced version and not trying it out before i could return it. i don't foresee them fixing any of the issues since Forza Horizon 5 is out now. i don't understand why they are both $60 this game feels like a $35 maybe even a $25 now.

also you have to deal with the shit mechanics of steering.

This game is Just what I expected for my money. 

Story:
Who cares, its a racing game. You get Top Gear missions though. 

Graphics: 
Amazing and immersive. I played everything on high with 120hz setting, not ultra which is the max.

Gameplay:
Great variety of cars and most of them feel unique, compared to each other. Cool races and I like the different options. 

Reviewing this game early, playtime wise, but I can see 5 hours in, you can play this game for hundred of hours, if you like it very much. Did not buy any DLC, but that looks really cool as well. Going to check out Horizon 5 also, next time its on 50% off, I guess.

4588,"I initially purchased the ultimate edition of this game after enjoying the Forza Motorsport series for many years. I entered this game with the understanding that it's open world and more arcadey. I was sorely disappointed to find the car purchasing system is entirely obsolete with the myriad of free cars from all the nonsense ""DLC."" There is no working your way through car classes. In fact, every race you show up for you are given the freedom to create the race entirely, class and car type, whatever you want. Directionless nonsense that completely removes the enticement of modding or tuning a car for better performance. Money is meaningless and there is no scale of cost vs. performance. Want a brand new corvette Z06? that'll be 8,000 Cr. Want a new Corvette Stingray? Arbitrarily 1,000,000 Cr. 

lets talk about seasons, because they pass in the blink of an eye. I started the game with the knowledge of this festival. Played the tutorial season and started the next one. 3 Races later I was in the next season! What? Where was the event? A few more races and it happened again. And the content generated by other players? You're stuck with all that nonsense too. Challenges formulated  by other players either happen in one of two ways, they are designed to not allow you to succeed or you complete a 1Hr race in 2 hr 33 sec....

- graphics are great,
- there is a ton of cars to choose from (more than any game i have played),
- livery editor allows you to customize your car paint however you want,
- driving feels good.

Things this game doesn't get quite right:
- AI is unimpresive and likes to ruberband,
- all AI races feel pretty much the same (gamemode variation is next to none),
- there is no story at all,
- mentioned livery editor lacks basic features (like undo),
- body kit options (spoilers, splitters...) are very limited (compared to decades old games like NFSU2),
- soundtrack is pretty lame,
-most car unlocks are tied to an RNG wheel spin (you will get plenty of them, but this still ruins any sense of 
 progression. If you are lucky you might get a car you want right away, if you are not you may never get it);

If you plan to play this game with a raceing wheel you can, but force feedback is pretty bad.

4801,"I initially got Forza Horizon 5; the benchmark race ran fine but the game did not load because of a memory access exception. So I decided to try the Previous Version. It didn't seem to look all that different from the new game.

Forza Horizon 4 is the best racing game that I've ever played. I am familiar with racing-serious games like Need For Speed and Gran Turismo. Forza Horizon 4 feels good. The cars feel heavy as they should, and the physics is as real as it can be with 'fun' as a factor in gameplay. 

I'm playing Civilization 6 and Disco Elysium, and I thought this game would be a great break for my Left Hemisphere. I let my Left hand manage 5 keys and it's all Muscle Memory once you get the hang of it in a few hours. It isn't some guilty pleasure game either. The mechanics is very sophisticated and the handling of your machine is a matter of razor-sharp timing and instinct-driven road negotiation. 

There are several annoying things about this game though. To start with, the good awful music makes driving a cringe-cruise. You can turn down the Radio to [1] and fire up Winamp feat Prodigy to address that. The characters are of funny design as well. You get to pick among a small pickle of protagonists who are supposed to represent the 'typical' gamer: lean, boring, 'jeans and t-shirt' wearing youths with social inadequacies. Some of the NPCs in the game, who I think might be professional racers, have better body frames, presence, and less social awkwardness. Reminder: You are just a Gamer and not a Racer. 

But hey, Forza 4 is set in Britain, so it's not like we're looking for high standards or substance. There is a great deal of Cheesing that happens in the game. Sometimes your vehicle just smothers out of control as though it is possessed by some wannabe Phallic-God programmer. This happens during every race that matters. The [R]ewind feature, when it's available that is, addresses some of the cheese with 'let's navigate around the Game Master with Time Travel'. 

All in all, the game is worth every penny or so of the 20$ I invested in it. Get serious with Civilization 6 and Disco Elysium; let go with Forza! Enjoy the company of the Bristol-pack and stale beer.",1,1,1,

4893,"I bought the Ultimate package of this game on 50% sale, hoping I would be able to run and enjoy it on my HP ProDesk. Long story short, I now very much enjoy Forza Horizon 4, but 8 GB of RAM wasn't enough and it took an extra RAM purchase after 70 hours of play to finally cancel out all the stuttering. 

Of course, only NOW have some people told me that the additional 32 GB was overkill... I think I'll leave it in.

=========================================

EDIT: I just ran into a separate issue of ""low streaming bandwidth,"" where during short races of exceptionally high speed (around 300 MPH if I read correctly), the road textures failed to draw on time and my car would stop immediately as though it had hit a brick wall. Then I could resume driving, but of course any timed challenges would fail because of the interruption. I eventually found a sort of partial workaround for all those short Super7 speed challenges: as soon as the challenge started (when I could begin driving), I would go into Photo Mode and take my time taking in-game photographs of the car from the NW/NE/SE/SW positions, and when I was done I could keep driving without interruption because all the required textures had loaded! Better than nothing, I guess.

EDIT 2: Or you can simply rewind your progress, if your challenge allows this, although do note that some do not!

EDIT 3: I’ve recently suffered the third partial wipeout of my save game. All my unshared liveries and most of my garage thumbnails are GONE! The progress, the money, the cars and their upgrades are intact, and I can still download my shared liveries from my Creative Hub, but it’s still a major PITA to have lost all those precious hours. 

So why, oh why do I continue to suffer these terrible faults? I think it’s because… I'm addicted. I suppose the game is like a hot girlfriend that keeps cheating and stealing and dissing and ghosting and ranting... but the quality time she spends happy with you is unmatched by anything else in the world. :-P",1,0,0,

Still very pricey tho when I purchased it but if like me you don't have an Xbox and miss the days of Forza when you used to have the X360, this is one for you.

It's even fun to just put on some music, and drive a hatchback at normal speeds across the world.

5144,"I’ve always had a soft spot for British cities, towns, villages and countryside. As someone who is a fan of open-world games, and enjoys an arcade racing game now and then, I definitely find Forza Horizon 4 an appealing title. It’s set in a highly condensed, simplified version of central and northern Great Britain that includes Edinburgh, the Scottish Highlands, the Lake District, Ambleside, Broadway, and Bamburgh. This picturesque, yet uncommon, setting for an open-world game, makes FH4 even more special.

Although Forza Horizon 5 was released past November, FH4 is still a relevant game. At the time of this review, the FH4 community is still quite active, with at least 20 players -- sometimes as many as 50 -- online in my sessions. With all additional official content for FH4 having been released, you’ll know exactly what you’ll get when you buy this game. When it comes down to it, your preference in scenery will be the major determining factor in deciding between FH4 and FH5.

FH4 is a playground with plenty of game modes to unlock and access. Aside from an impressive tutorial that guides you through various types of races, terrains, seasons, and weather conditions in the first several minutes, you pretty much have free reins on your driving adventure from the start. The action in FH4 centres on:
story-based challenges called Horizon Stories, with The Stunt Driver and British Racing Green being my favourites;
races (Road, Dirt, Street, Cross Country, and Showcase), with racing/chasing a train in a 1959 Ford Anglia like in Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets being most memorable;
PR stunts (speed traps and zones, stunt jumps, drifting zones); and
events (live in-game challenges titled Forzathon Live, as well as daily and weekly challenges).

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2684469342

There is also a battle royale mode called The Eliminator, as well as a series of user-created challenges named Super7. Mechanically inclined players can also tune their vehicles, artistic ones can design liveries for their cars, construction oriented folks can devise new racing routes, and shutterbugs can capture their favourite cars at eye-catching moments using the in-game camera mode. All can share their creations with the FH4 community to enjoy. FH4 has something for everybody regardless of your levels of enthusiasm and skill for driving and racing games. It even offers to adjust the difficulty level based on your recent racing performances.

If you wish, you can simply explore the over 300 roads on the map. I spent my first 30 hours or so mainly doing that, plus triggering speed traps and zones, doing stunt jumps, destroying smashable signs, and seeking and photographing as many of the over 700 featured cars as I could. I’ve truly enjoyed the freedom with which I had just exploring the in-game world by car, without ever worrying about the police, griefers, and dying. This is something that even Grand Theft Auto couldn’t offer.

If that’s not enough, there are the expansion packs: Fortune Island and LEGO Speed Champions. The former transports you to a mountainous island with sheer cliffs and extreme weather, and the latter to the joyful LEGO Valley, where structures are made of LEGO bricks. If you enjoy driving or racing games with challenging terrain and treasure hunting, I think you’ll enjoy Fortune Island. I recommend LEGO Speed Champions to all because it’s just so whimsical and delightful to see LEGO vehicles go toe-to-toe against real cars.

FH4 employs tricks like endowed progress effect, artificial scarcity, randomized reward, and leaderboards to make gameplay addictive. You’re awarded Skill or Influence Points for almost everything you do. Skill Points convert to Perks for your cars, and Influence Points unlock new races, events and prizes. Winning races and completing events will earn you Credits, which you use to buy new cars and houses. At times, you’ll get the chance to win (rare) prizes in Wheelspins. With these reward systems in place, FH4 is more fun and addictive than I had initially imagined.

Don’t want to wait to win or buy a specific car? You can see if one of the several DLC car packs has it. I decided to buy Forza Horizon 4: Ultimate Edition mainly because I wanted the LEGO Speed Champions expansion pack and the Best of Bond Car pack. I don’t regret my decision, for this is the closest I’ll ever get to driving cross Britain in a 1964 Aston Martin DB5, even though it doesn’t come with Q’s enhancements.

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2684410944

What keeps FH4 interesting and dynamic after all these hours is that the game changes season every real-time week. Each season comes new events and challenges, such as being able to drag race on a frozen lake in winter. If anything, FH4 has so much content that the game’s menu and map can get overwhelming, and disorienting. It’s one of the game’s few shortcomings. The other is the absence of a custom radio station, which is a real shame since I’d love to play soundtrack from James Bond films as I trek across the land in the DB5.

Playing FH4 has been an entertaining way to bid 2021 farewell, and welcome 2022. At the time of this review, I’ve clocked in just under 80 hours of playing time, and I foresee putting in many more in the weeks to come. Needless to say, I highly recommend this game to anyone who enjoys open-world games and arcade racing games. While the Ultimate Edition may not be for you, I think the base game and at least a couple of the DLCs are worth checking out.",1,1,1,

Don't get me wrong the game is rely enjoyable but the auto-save system is terrible. The game is suppose to save automatically all your progress but i do not work. When they do an update you roll back on your previous save so be prepare for the 'Special snow event' around Christmas when you lose a big chunk of your progress but look it has snow in the game now!

I try contacting Microsoft on that and they just close my ticket saying that they can restore an old save or a corup one. Basically, they cannot do anything. If they could just incorporate a regular save button in game it will save a lot of headache.",1,0,0,

5216,"This game saved my life.

I am 38.

My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and adopted our son together. They are now both 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I found myself lost and miserable. I was self destructive. I got so mad one day from everything spiraling out of my control that I punched some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion. That caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand... my working hand... my games hand.. the hand that I held and carried my children to bed with.. The hand I desperately needed to make sure I could continue to provide.

After learning of the severity of my self-inflicted damage, I was borderline suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety. I have never had fits of rage, or been one to break down and cry, but I was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side.

Having nothing better to do, I searched for a game I could play, ONE HANDED while I recovered. I somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews. I decided that it had to be worth a shot... I must admit, I didn't beat the game, or play nearly as long as some of you. In fact, I may have only played this game a day or two.. With that being said, after doing so, I had a new found joy and hope for life. I was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me. I was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness. I was able to see the fruits of my ""labor"". I relaxed for 5 :hillary: :hillary: :hillary: :hillary: :hillary: :hillary: :hillary: minutes to this music long enough to realize that I was going to be okay.
After coming to that realization, I turned the game off, and I went back to work. It hurt my hand like hell but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself, and I became the father I needed to be in that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving as.

Today, I am close friend with my kids mother. We don't fight, or argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents, and friends.

I now have 3 kids. My third child is, wait for it, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my own separation, and we just stumbled in to each others life unexpectedly. We have been in a relationship for a year now, and are very happy together.

Moral of the story, you never know what life holds in store for you, and if I would have given up when all the odds were stacked against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

5261,"The game looks good and runs well.

The cars are beautiful, the simulation of the behaviour of the different cars is really surprising,  and the number of cars is huge. So huge, that I am badly missing some organisation means for it like 'garage1' and 'garage2' . Fiddling through the whole list again and again is getting boring very soon. And looking at that nice car is no big fun, since there is no easy way to move the camera simply and freely.
There is no way to get rid of that music, the environmental sounds are extremely loud, so the endless repeating sound background is really nerve-wracking.

The game is very unstructured and seems to be a collection of completely different game ideas, and I always wonder what these Forza guys have been smoking. 
The menu system is a complete mess, and if you pick a task it sometimes is difficult to find out what the game wants you to do. Many of the tasks are ridiculously unrealistic, and for a normal human being like me simply unrealizable. 

As someone who drove a selection of the cars in real live, I would be very interested in tuning and driving a car realistically, going for a test ride on a favourite track, than tune again etc etc - improving my amateur skills again and again until changing to the next higher car class.

But there is even no means of getting your lap times for a certain track and car in order to compare cars or tunings, so it is more or less impossible to do a decent regular training.
The 'rivals' tab ingame does not really help, since it lacks the historical list of rivals and cars.
There is no chance of working on a serious and controlled skills improvement.

The potential of the game is by far better than what they made out of it.
As you might experience in the online-events, it is a game from muddlers for muddlers, all without a driving license.

5369,"I'm not in the right demographic for racing games so I can't compare it with anything, but this game has blown me away nonetheless and sparked my interest for the genre. I can't put it down.  

The environment and atmosphere are absolutely amazing. It's relatively easy to pick up as a beginner, but it still leaves you a lot of room for improvement and learning to drive/race properly. There are a lot of activities, and playing with a friend is also a lot of fun, contrary to my initial expectations. 

I've had so much fun that I got myself a steering wheel (which works great). No regrets.",1,1,1,

5382,"If you can't use IPv6 you cant go online and play with friends so the game is worthless, IPv6 is pretty rare when it comes to IPv4 vs. IPv6 Idk why they use IPsec, i have to use a VPN because my internet carrier doesn't even carry IPv6 or rather they don't even use it. its pretty stupid that they require a VPN for people to even play online, the game is fun offline but you can't sell or by cars with other people. i was trying to sell some of my cars so i can afford an Ferrari 599x Evo but i can't buy or sell, and now there is no way for me to get the damn car because i can't even use the damn backstage passes because those require internet to be used tooo! so if you want to play online or buy and sell cars i would not recommend this game...

Considering forza 5 also has serious connection issues alongside of it bugs u may wanna give it a second thought on it  if u gonna play with ur friends.

The customisation of cars is kind of lacking in some respects (i.e. I want to actually refurb a car from scratch, which I know isn't the point of this game but still). Racing mechanics are nice and to top it all off, it's pretty easy to progress within the game. Overall, a solid 8/10 game for me. Will likely buy Forza 5 to see the difference!",1,1,1,

When I reached the Autumn qualifier race in-game (after the sort-of prologue season), my game would not load beyond the title screen. Crash after crash for over 6 hours trying to get the game to work.

I searched online and many other people were experiencing this (for some reason, SPECIFICALLY after getting to the Autumn season which is bizzare, not as bizzare as the solution!).

Someone on a steam thread said to turn on Bluetooth... uhhh okay...? And like a miracale from god, after turning on my computer's bluetooth, the game loaded in.

This is unbelievable and should not be an issue for so many people. I cannot recommend a game with a bizarre bug that can completely ruin your entire experience if you play beyond the 2 hour refund time frame.",0,0,1,

Storyline is okay with interesting missions, until around 10 hours where you still can't skip cutscenes or the storyline takes over your PC and does not allow you to skip.
 No CUTSCENE SKIP was my tipping point. Mother of God man, allow us to skip. 

Don't get me wrong, the sounds are great and the game is fun with cool missions. Fast pace chaos and skill if you're into that, but in no way is it a 'simulator'. It's a game and for that I can recommend it. But no cutscene option is obscene.",0,0,1,

Like buying houses beauty spots lot of car jackpots speed catchers drift areas etc. i like this game very much but there is some things need to add.

1-Private message: I think we should have to message someone ingame.

2-text chat: Maybe only 100+ level players should use this but this feature needed to add. 

3-Double controls: sometimes i play with one hand keyboard so i shift up with q-e buttons but when i play with two hands i have to change controls for shift button every time and i think u want to solve this problem u have too add double buttons.

4- Cheaters need to banned! i looked a quests leaderboards and i see 00.00.05 second in the top and its actually impossibble for this quest. They was 150+ level with thia timing cuz they are cheated. They need to be banned.

HOWEVER

some of the story modes present you with tasks that are quite literally, not possible.

Chapter One of the Horizon Top Gear Special.

You're taking a Lotus 5.8 miles, but they want you to do it in under a minute and fourty seconds.

Thanks to the many twists and turns, (and that fact that it's FIVE POINT EIGHT FUCKING MILES), it isn't possible to achieve the three star goal in the given time. The car doesn't have the speed.


Another thing, Isha's Taxis is EXTREMELY glitchy. Constantly spawned me out of the map, the timer started speeding up, and sometimes it wouldn't let me use the ""restart event"" button.

I mean other than that the game is great.",1,1,1,

5721,"This game features a setting in and around the UK that feels dreamlike to me. Graphics, combined with (mostly) realistic sound effects, and that [b] magnificent [/b] four-seasons, living, breathing atmosphere just sucks me in every time. Each season feels like a fresh start to this game. Then, when you take into account that this game is full of extra content that is quite different from the main gameplay while also being extremely fun to play, I really see no reason for anyone slightly interested in car/racing games to try out.

Microsoft offers the best regional pricing on all of its older titles including this one, so no matter where you live, this is a timeless classic and an instant buy when it's on sale. Yes, Forza Horizon games have some letdowns that alienate the hardcore racing game fans, but this game has quite a lot to offer to the fans from every corner of the casual-hardcore spectrum. Racing is extremely fun and varied, though it might not be realistic enough for the hardcore audience.

If exploring the amazing European landscape in every season of the year alone sounds interesting to you, just get this game and treat yourself. This game just fuses all the aspects you could possibly want from a (more casual) racing game into an exquisite masterpiece.",1,1,1,

I had bad experiences with my Xbox/Microsoft account where it wouldn't let me access the auction house for some time, but mainly I kind of ran out of ideas on what to do in the game, and therefore made it boring. This is probably because I am more of a simcade racing fan though where physics and mechanics are more realistic, and the tracks are fixed and set, so this will not apply for everyone.

I feel like this game is mainly on personal preference, some may love it, some may not share the same experience. Especially with the hefty price tag I somewhat regret purchasing the game. If you do want to try the game out for yourself, I believe the Microsoft store on Windows offer a free Forza Horizon 4 demo where you can mess around for about a few hours. I regret skipping that step, and instead went straight for the purchase. 

Hope this helps.",0,1,0,

6040,"The Forza franchise has come through, once again, with an excellent racing sim.  It feels realistic and challenging, yet somehow does not feel too dry or uninteresting.  No race modes compromise the emphasis of another; they all offer their own flavors, and do it pretty well.  

Multiplayer mechanics/matchmaking is really okay, it's just kinda there.  Maybe I don't try hard enough to make use of it, but I personally have not found it convenient to engage with other players. There are a few 'event' modes that will attract people to play with, but that's about it.  Playing with friends of course being slightly easier.

Well fleshed out the dynamics of the this ""sim"" are excellent. Cars are customizable and plenty of variety through out the game. It starts of STRONG and you don't have to grind to get money cars too much. 

The quantity of different racing modes is what really appeals to me. Events like Top Gear challenges, dirt racing, Rally, and Stunt tracks are so well done, I can't find fault in any of them. 

Difficulty is well handled and the reason I love this so much. You've got the option of making things easy enough to enjoy the game and slowly crank things up as your skill progresses, all the way to high realism. This is usually a barrier in other games. You're not punished for being mediocre. Microsoft really innovated with the Rewind feature and this REALLY shines here. Forget about replaying the tracks if you make a minor mistake. Far from cheating, this tool allows for laser precision as a teaching tool. I was able to hone in on my weaknesses around various tracks and it quickly made me a better sim driver. Much faster than restarting every time I made a mistake. You have the option to not use it so die hard shouldn't hate.

6086,"First is what I don't like, Forza Horizon 4 is very very difficult to get started and the devs make you jump through hoops in order to get it working, like turning your firewall off, make sure windows 10 is up to date, make sure your graphics card is up to date bla bla bla, this game is harder to start than a 1990's ford escort with a Blown diff.

These sorts of problems occur when you try an integrate a game with operating system among other bloatware that don't work together and causes complications on Gamers PC's.

Concept of this game is the same as Need for speed pro street, The map I have discovered is same as or vicer versa Forza Horizon 5, the difference is devs have moved different road ways from one section of the map to another, don't believe me? look at the huge motorway in both FH4 and FH5 practically the same but moved to different sections of the map, Devs are doing what the Cod devs use to do recycle same map over and over again and change a few things in hopes that gamers wouldn't notice and oh but changed the scenery to match the country, UK moist, Mexico dry.

It looks pretty and plays well when it works.

By the way I have intel 9th gen 9700 8 core cpu
Gtx1070 8GB
32 GB of ram
mid range SSD card for storage

you would think with this setup I wouldn't have any issues, generally I don't that would indicate issues are coming from the product which has been poorly made.

6098,"This Microsoft Studios game absolutely refuses to detect my Microsoft XBOX controller which works with literally every other game I own. Googling for a solution leads to nothing helpful or of substance and if you look in the discussions for this game there are others who are recently experiencing this issue who are not being helped. I've updated everything, unplugged everything, messed with steam configurations to no avail. Was really looking forward to playing this as a christmas treat but instead 2 hours of my christmas free time have been sunk into troubleshooting why literally only this game refuses to detect the recent controller made by the same company. Frankly, a disgrace.

Edit: I was able to find a fix for the controller issue:
On the page for the game in your library, click the settings gear, click properties >controller, and under the dropdown for ""Override for Forza Horizon 4"" set it to ""Disable Steam Input"". This fixed the issue for me.",1,0,0,

6234,"Forza Horizon 4 entered my library on a whim. It looked like a neat game, and I had heard that the FH series is somewhat like Burnout: Paradise, which is one of my favorite games from a while back.

It turns out that, yes, the Burnout: Paradise comparison is apt, and yes, this game is ridiculously fun. I legitimately did not expect to spend a whole weekend playing this nonstop, nor did I expect that I’d turn around and buy the two DLC expansions to get more races and cars to screw around with. It has somehow ended up becoming one of my favorite games of the past few years. 

FH4 is heavily concerned with your fun. There are a number of things you can customize to either make the game a good simulation racer, or you can turn it into a ridiculous arcade game. You can spend hours of your time tuning your favorite sports car to perfection, or you can buy a GMC Van, download a livery to make it look like the Mystery Machine from Scooby Doo, tune it to go 170mph, and barrel through the British countryside knocking down trees and fences. 

The game scales every race to the kind of car you are driving, and for the most part, you have freedom to drive anything in any race. If you want to be serious and take your tuned up sports car to long races, or if you want to be a moron and drive a 3-wheeled baby car that struggles to go up hills, the game will tune the race to your level. You don’t even need to worry about winning, for the most part. In championship races and for some of the DLC races, getting first place is important, but otherwise it doesn’t really matter much except that you get more bonuses at the end to spend on cars. It’s strangely refreshing to not be worried about nailing first in every single race. With the way the game scales each event, I often find myself purposefully driving crappy cars just for the fun of it.

I could gush about how fun FH4 is for a long time, mainly because it was such an expectedly fun game that makes an effort at making sure you are having fun while playing it. The little things that bothered me about the game didn’t take away from how much fun the whole experience was. If you are going to pick this game up, I heartily recommend picking up the full package that comes with the DLC (Fortune Island and LEGO Speed Champions).",1,0,0,

This was such a great entry and huge improvement over what I felt was a pretty stale third entry overall. You have so many cars to mess around with and being able to get this on sale with everything that was added is the way to go. The two DLCs are great and add some fun new things. Lego is always going to be a draw, which they do some great things with to vary up what the normal gameplay with. You aren't just stuck in the added cars either, it encourages you to use cars you wouldn't normally have brought out to do some of the challenges.  After that (or before, it's your choice), you get to do Fortune Island which focuses on extreme weather racing. I loved this DLC as creates an enormous amount of variety in a little island. You get to do some of the better dirt tracks along with some great street style stuff.  Adding on top of that are the huge cash prizes you get for completing the different riddles, which add a great layer of fun to exploring. So far I have only done the DLC this time around, but I am going to dive in and do the main races as well now. Of note for people looking at this versus 5, the main campaign style racing is much more open from the beginning and doesn't filter you down a path of unlockables.",1,1,1,

Cons: do NOT use keyboard for this game. Drifting with keyboard is just bs. On top of this, drifting in this game imitates real-life drifting, meaning it is much harder than drifting in other racing games, but u will get better and better at it along the way.",1,1,1,

I was put off by the ""MMO"" aspect at first but they've managed to pull it off in a way that's unobtrusive and fun; and you can still play offline if you prefer. It's the most fun I've had on a racing game in a long time.

The bad: The devs engage in a lot of shady, unethical practices. Unskippable video ads for DLC in between certain events; bugs that are known, old, and will never be patched because they're already focused on the next game; buggy and often unplayable multiplayer (which is a shame because a lot of season rewards are bound to multiplayer events); and ""matchmaking"" that does nothing to match you up with players close to your skill.

Game has an unskippable intro. You also seem to be getting video ads for DLCs, unskippable as well.

Wouldn't recommend unless its dirt cheap like 5-10 euros. I would have hated to pay 50-60 for this cash grab

Plutôt que de redire ce que d'autres ont dit sur le jeu, voilà ce que je vais rajouter: 

-  Même après la sortie de Forza Horizon 5, ça vaut le coup d'acheter (aussi) Forza Horizon 4, ne serait-ce que je préfère l'Angleterre au Mexique.

- Le DLC ""Hot Wheels™ Legends Car Pack"" (6 voitures) n'est  pas présent dans la version Ultimate.

- Pour acquérir de nouvelles voitures, je n’aurais qu'un mot à dire: enchères, enchères, enchères... (ok les tirages aussi) mais surtout enchères, je préfère d'ailleurs plutôt obtenir lors d'un tirage 100, 000 Crédits que je dépenserai dans les enchères à une voiture de rareté bleue.

Sinon, je conseillerai d'installer Forza 4 Horizon sur SSD (le conseil est encore plus valable pour Forza Horizon 5)

World is not extremely large a la Just Cause, but its enough to have varied vistas while racing. There are a ton of cars, even some that are really bad, so every type of driver can drive what they want. I have a three-wheeled van with waifu paint job and training wheels. Something for everyone. One small complaint: I think there is a memory leak or the game doesn't release assets when they're not in use anymore because I get buttery smooth 130 fps on ultra settings at 2550x1440 at startup, but after about 3 hours of driving across the island I end up with 80 fps and choppy with shadows and textures popping in and out.

6696,cannot use wheel on steam too bad,0,1,0,
6697,"Games sucks. Controls are either too sensitive for a steering wheel, or not sensitive enough. It basically forces you to use a controller, because you sure as s*** ain't using a mouse and keyboard (this ain't GMod controlling, sadly. Can barely fine-tune it). Only can modify Tire Pressure at the beginning (WTF), can't get a f***ing game that's supposed to be centered all around cars to work decently with a high-grade steering wheel. I have to set the b**** to 270 degrees rather than the preferred 900 degree limit to compensate for this game's lack of control responsiveness. 


Devs were more worried about getting some stupid a** LEGO racing into the game (WHICH NO ONE ASKED FOR, LAST TIME I CHECKED) than getting controls to accurately function in the game. I should not be forced to use a damn CONTROLLER over a STEERING WHEEL to get this game to function correctly!

I even had to modify the damn dead-zones, and all that does it just make it more damn wacky. It doesn't sync to your steering wheel set-up AT ALL...

There's only ONE good thing about this game, and that's that got All The Remains into the game as far as music. The rest is just... ""Ear-bleed causing"", or at least the majority is. Some are not bad. Still, can't select wtf you want to listen to, like you could with say.... Need For Speed. At least the last game I played of that series.

6784,"Oh, my, lord... you need to get this game if you LOVE open world games! I'll admit, I was a little disappointed that the map wasnt this huge landscape, but as I got more into the game, it is a really huge map with highways,  cities, great lakes, and gigantic mountains! Even if you think that you wont be able to play this game with mouse and keyboard,  GET THIS GAME, its really not all that difficult with a mouse and keyboard! I also want to add that the amount of detail they put into the car models is STUNNING, I mean, its just like looking at my car in real life! In addition, the community of this game is very good! if you get this game, I suggest you join the Forza official discord server, you can learn a lot from it! In conclusion, Forza horizon 4 is an amazingly beautiful game, that you should definitely try for yourself, if you like open world/ simulation games.

P.S:
I would also like to add that you dont need this super gaming computer to run it! Forza automatically chooses the best settings for your computer, and optimizes the game for you so that it still looks great!",1,0,0,

6911,"One of the best racing games I've seen, If you are a racing newbie like me, this game is a good one to learn on. It has this line that turns yellow and red to tell you if you are going too fast for the upcoming turn.... REALLY handy for learning the ropes. It's not too hard core as a driving simulator either... If you can't do ok turn down the difficulty or try a different car. Seriously, you might get last place every time in one car, but try a different car and you might be starting to see first place. Find the car that works for you.

Anyway, lots to do and much fun to be had. The one caution I would give is that this game has high requirements for your computer. I thought my 10 year old computer was still reasonably good, but the game proceeded to warn me that it was BELOW the lowest requirements. LOL I laugh because after tooning the game for my computer, as it recommends, it lowered my resolution, but the game plays fine. So if you don't have a top end computer, this game will likely not look as good as it could, but it'll still play fine. So it's all good in my book. :)",1,1,1,

now.... as for the downsides. the game can be plaid by a toddler, i guess that is part of the target audience. for me though within my first 30 min of playing I already had over 10 cars, everyone kept giving me cars for no reason, I have absolutely no use for my in game cash apart from buying cars I want to drive, I feel that there should be some element of struggle while building up your career.

as a final point I do recommend the game because there are definitely fun elements and it is a good looking game but i find it hard to play for long periods of time because it doesn't feel like there is any real progression",1,1,1,

7088,"Very well ballanced racing game that found a sweet spot between arcade and realism, while still keeping the fun.
Plus the overall the game has very relaxing feeling as it' great to jump in, do a few races and then jump out.

Pros:
- The unique 4 season UK themed map.
- variety of weather conditions and day-night cycle
- the driving model is well ballanced between arcade an realism - each car type feels different, each track ground feel different, even different track state is different (dry, wet, snow, ice), you simply can't be bored and always find something new and fun.
- good soundtrack and radio stations.
- variety of race types (sprint, drift, off-road, city races).
- fun mini-stories (like Top Gear, Delivery Company, Insurance Claim company, Upgrade Heroes)
- bazilion of cars to choose.
- many collectibles and challenges.
- customizable difficulty (the default one was relaxing for me, while giving me a challenge just from time to time)

Cons:
- unskippable victory animations.
- choosable player characters are absolutely ugly, there are only 2 or 3 that doesn't make your eyes bleed.
- chothes accessories can only be won in lottery, but most of them are stupid/meme clothes.
- the overall concept of lottery completely destroy the progression - either you're showered with tons of cars liek no tommorow, or you get junk clothes that even clown would be ashemed to wear.
- some mini-stories and characters have really cringe and corny dialogues (e.g. The Taxi company).
- there is not much progression beyone a few initial rounds of racing.
- the car selection screen GUI is very poor and gets worse with the amount of cars we get.
- suprisingly, there is waaaaay to many cars - I got like 60 cars from lottery, but I use 4 at best.

The gfx and controls are basically flawless and this game gives you a lot of ways to make it more or less challenging by enabling or disabling things like assisted steering, automatic shifting and instant rewind as well as 5 difficulty settings that never really penalize you for making it as easy as possible. I snagged the Ultimate version of this game and I must say, the number of cars it gives you right from the beginning is absolutely unbelievable! I may never drive them all, but having this many choices and an abundance of resources for upgrades and customization, makes this game an instant favorite for me. I keep telling all my friends they should buy it now while it's on sale because in terms of value, this game delivers far more than I ever could have imagined!

7364,"Game crashes every 2-3 hours of play.  Disabling xbox live helped somewhat but unable to find a complete solution.  It sucks extra because you have zero control over when and where the game saves so you have no idea how much time and effort you have lost until you reload.

Oversteer is stupidly out of whack.  By default EVERY car has huge amounts of oversteer to the point that they're undrivable.  Your rear end will be severely fishtailing on you at every corner and every time you touch the brakes and if you try to correct it you will get rewarded with a spin in the other direction.  It can be fixed in the tuning garage if you know car setup telemetry but shouldn't need to be.

Engine sounds are inexcusably terrible.  A supercharged V-10 '70 Corvette with race exhaust sounds like stiff playing cards in the spokes of a bicycle.  A Polaris RZR 1000 sounds exactly like my neighbor's electric leaf blower.   The Buick Grand National sounds like a Prius with stock exhaust.  A Shelby King Cobra could pass for a Ninja Smoothie Blender.  Just a few highlights but there are over 700 car sounds that suck badly and about 23 that are good.

However it's marred by crash to desktop every hour or two, unskipable commercials, and it feels like an absolute minimum effort console port.

Edit: Changed from thumbs down to thumbs up; Crash to desktop was solved with adding a bigger Pagefile in Windows. Even with 16GB physical RAM, more Pagefile was required. But at least it's not crashing often. Unskippabe commercials are still present though not so often. Would be nice to be able to skip cutscenes in general.",1,0,0,

Проблема в том, что сначала игры у тебя есть полный доступ ко всему, деньги льются рекой, проблем накопить на машину нет. И это главный минус. Мне, как человеку, который привык тратить по несколько часов за игрой, чтобы открыть и купить интересную мне машину, было это в новизну и сильно отталкивает. Вот вы катаетесь на Форд Фокус начальном, через часа 3 у вас в распоряжении МакЛарен. 

Физика отдельная тема. Можно ее конечно настроить под себя, но пробуксовка на любом автомобиле со временем вам сильно надоест. Иногда кажется, что разработчики особо то и не управляли машиной в жизни. Не все автомобили уходят в занос на каждом повороте. Однако есть автомобили, которыми очень удобно и приятно управлять, например Mercedes CLK GTR или Jeep Trailcat. Авто реально все по разному управляются, но дрифт очень надоедает со врменем.

7760,"[b] Pros: [/b] 
+ large amounts of cars
+ good optimization (GTX 1060 is good enough for 1080p@60fps)
+ driving is enjoyable (most of the times)

[b] Cons: [/b]
- you cannot disable cut-scenes
- no radio station persistence (if you disable the radio, any cut-scene or fast-travel might enable it again)
- you cannot switch to correct driving side (game is located in UK, thus defaults to left handed driving side, which cannot be changed)
- difficulty jumps (you might finish one race in 1/3 of the given time and the next one will be almost impossible to finish with more than 2 stars)
- restarting a race (i.e. if you f' up and want to redo it) can take more time to load than the race itself
- car stats do not mean jack (they seem to be relative, not absolute, thus rendering them pretty useless)
- unskippable ads for DLCs 
- absolute clusterf' of an UI (you will get used to it)

If you like car racing games and want something great to play with a gamepad, go for it!
I mean, I like racing sims and love to play Assetto Corsa with G29 on a ""proper"" sim rig, but Forza Horizon Series is another thing!
While it doesn't feel good with a steering wheel, FH is excellent and light years ahead of any Need for Speed, which was my ""keyboard/gamepad-arcade"" game of choice for a long time, until the original Carbon.
I recommend you to play Horizon with an Xbox One controller, or at least not on keyboard, for the best experience!",1,1,1,

7812,good,1,1,1,
7813,"Got this because I have a G29, the most mass-market of all wheels. Game is supported for the wheel, yet for some strange reason after driving straight for 10 seconds, it automatically turns left or right. Inverting the FFB helped...until it didn't. Yes, I have GHub opened at the same time; yes it did the calibration. It simply malfunctions: phantom throttle presses, unregistered presses (even in offline solo mode). I even checked online for any presets, but presets won't help with phantom registers. Okay, so then I played the game with an Xbox controller. Got first in every event. So no, this game isn't recommended for a AAA title failing to integrate the most popular wheel out there. But it is recommended for Xbox controller-only play. It's a shame, because it has everything else going for it. But even NFS can be perfectly fun with just the basic features of G29 supported. Project Cars, perfect integration. Assetto Corsa, Dirt Rally 2, minor tweaking to go. If Forza 5 support for wheels is like this, then this review works for that game as well. A driving game without a steering wheel is simply garbage.

Edit: Wheel works with the game on a different PC. Keeping the review negative because it should work fine on all PCs. Problem could be Logitech and may be fixed in Forza 5 so to each their own mileage. Controller is still a better option because it just feels more accurate. Love the instant rewind feature in the races. The one thing that separates this game from all my other racing games. Very innovative as far as I know. If you are going to gamble on this purchase, get it on discount. It's still a very good game...using controllers.",0,0,1,

"" Gameplay is not linear . "" I mean you get out of your garage and there is thousands of races you can go but no connection between them . You can just start whereever you want . And that is meaningless .",1,0,0,

7854,"Its an amazing game, hell probably one of the best racing games out there. It mixes sim like racing with arcade style racing in such a flawless manner that I often think to myself ""Why can't all racing games be like this?"". Its fun and a very chill game. However, if I'm to criticise this game, the very praise I give the game becomes its dark side. The game just gives out rewards, leaving the player unsatisfied with the achievements they receive. For example, in Horizon 1, each purchase of a car was calculated, as every race event in that game required the player to meet certain criteria when entering the event. This made the player competitive when it comes to races as they have to win in order to get money so that they can buy a great car. But in Horizon 4, the event changes according to the car wit which you enter. Yes, it becomes more player friendly, but i feel it removes the challenge aspect. A game can be in the form of a stress free capsule like ABZU, but Forza Horizon isn't such a title. You have the open world which is amazing and calm to drive in, but the races are to challenging. The game fails to balance challenge with the sense of relaxation. What I'm trying to say is that the sense of progression is not present in Horizon 4. You can complete 3/4th of the game with the cars they provide for free in the initial stages. There is no sense of achievement when one shows in a Chiron in Horizon 4's multiplayer as the obvious thought which goes into the opposition's mind is ""Oh, they must've gotten it in a wheel spin!"" Even though the player might've played and bought the car with the credits he earned. 

To complain that a game is giving out huge in-game rewards for free feels like a douchy thing to say. But it removes the challenge from the game. With that being said, Horizon 4 isn't a bad game. Its an amazing game. The graphics, the gameplay all checks out. But I'm not so happy with the reward system. Its too REWARDING. Balance it out, THEN you have the best racing game in the world

7877,"Generally a great driving game. Realistic looking graphics, loads of cars and I like the way it changes season every week. My only criticism is of the in-game map. I think they should've just concentrated on Edinburgh and it's outskirts or maybe just Scotland, rather than creating an unrealistic map of the UK with selected major landmarks, which for example makes the Uffington White Horse and Edinburgh Castle appear a lot closer to each other than they are in real life.

Really looking forward to playing FH5 once I've got it!",1,1,1,

With that being said, the first 3-4 hours are tutorial races, and when I bought this game to play it with friends, the fact I couldn't go online until way later was an enormous hassle.  This, combined with the constant interruptions from your in-game companions always updating you about what's new on the map and telling you to open it is really frustrating.

The music has been well picked, Horizon Pulse, Horizon Bass Arena, Horizon Block Party, Horizon XS, Hospital Records, Timeless FM, and LEGO Valley exclusive Radio Awesome are all amazing and bound to have something for everyone to listen to, or there's always the option to turn the in-game radio off and just enjoy the sound of your engine roaring in a race. Internet isn't required to play as Horizon Solo is the offline/single player option, but I highly recommend playing while connected to the internet and signed into XBOX Live, as most the best content is user created and you'll need internet and an XBOX Live profile to access it.

8525,"Forza Horizon 4 is a very appetizing racing game, whether you're a casual player or a racing simulator player who wants control over his car, even at low to moderate levels.

The freedom offered in this game is very interesting to explore, because you can be the type of player you like, you can play casually, you can also play competitively through ranked adventure mode.

The weakness of this game is in the mode which is enough to repeat if you are far in this game. and also the time gate that limits us to get all the cars in this game.

And the biggest drawback is .... the multiplayer mode is very inefficient and also very difficult for casual players to understand, due to the multilayer log-in that you have to do to play this game with your friends.",1,1,1,

It's not perfect though - absolutely insufferable, annoying voice acting/characters, which is worsened by the fact that you can't skip intro logo (very loud), cinematics or those 'pre-mission' cutscenes where those sim-looking characters do the same animations over and over, until the annoying voice lines stop.

For the avid racer who enjoys having all the control over their car, Forza 4 is the ultimate racing simulator. With its unique blend of arcade, arcade mode and sim, this game is ideal for the racing game player. With this title you'll find that it is the perfect companion as you drive over your next favourite track.

1. Forza Motorsport 4 has a blend of arcade, arcade and simulator.

For the racing game player, Forza 4 is a game that has that love of car with the ability to really control the car. Forza 4 has the best open world ever. The game allows the player to choose their favourite track and drive your dream car around the most iconic circuits around the world.

2. The features you would expect in an arcade experience like to player how many laps they would like and how many laps in a race. Forza 4 is great at motivating the player to drive and provides various ways to help the player enjoy the game. The game also has an incredible graphics that almost brings to life the car's models.

3. For the simulator racer, the great thing about this game is that the cars are simulated at a max speed of 2 million.

For the player who wants to feel what it is like to drive a stock car, Forza 4 is a fantastic racing game. With a feel like no other driving game out there and a great collection of vehicles to drive, it is ideal for a simulator driver. It is great to see that some of the biggest names in the simracing world are featuring in Forza 4.

4. To ensure a great gameplay, Forza 4 also offers an online racing experience.

Not to leave out the offline play experience, you will also find the option to play with your friends through a feature called Online Racing. To put the icing on the cake, this game is a great game for the Xbox gamer. If you are looking to upgrade from your old Xbox or if you are looking to buy an Xbox One as a Christmas present, then Forza 4 is the ideal game for you.

5. The cars that you get to drive are just awesome!

The cars are the big highlight for most racing gamers. And Forza 4 has that depth in car customization that makes the game special. From the epic Cosworth AC, Nissan GTR or even the new NISSAN GT-R, there is a car out there for you.

6. That driving is a blast!

You can choose from one of the 20 plus cars and drive the best tracks out there in Forza 4. It is almost impossible not to have a more fun time driving a car around the world. The tracks in this game are so iconic and famous that it makes you want to drive them all!

7. New features are added to this every year

With Forza 4, the developers always add something new to the game. New races, new cars, new tracks, new challenges and last but not least, new ways to play the game. In fact, it is a treat for gamers who loveingly play Forza Motorsport for many years to have a game that is just as fun and user friendly with a lot of updates to make the game that much more fun for both casual and hardcore racing gamers.

8. The tracks are varied

As you would expect from the makers of the Forza series, the tracks are varied, and all so fun to drive. As a fan of Forza Motorsport, you can expect the best tracks you have ever played.

To prove it, we compared the track Forza 4 features against the rest of the top racers and came up with the most impressive, and here are some of them:

Tune Yards

Unlike the road car racing games, we will not come to a halt every time a corner is coming up. We don't want to be reminded of what else we could have been doing. Also, you will be able to enjoy this game no matter the traffic conditions.

All time Achiever Track

Again unlike other racers, here the objective is simple and it is to drive the fastest time on the track. This tracks challenges you to drive the fastest lap in no less than four laps. The Time Trial track ranks the fastest competitors in the world and if you...i ran out of free characters",1,1,1,
8921,yes yes very gud,1,1,1,
8922,LOVE THIS GAME,1,1,1,
8923,"TL;DR: Basically the best racing arcade of all time.

Before starting, i want to say that it is NOT a simulator, for those of you who want hyperrealistic physics, buy other games as Assetto Corsa, iRacing or F1.

Despite Forza Horizon 5 is available, i still think that FH4 is just better because of the low price compared to 5th part. And i tried FH5, it just not have enough reasonable changes to buy it for full price right now (get gamepass)

The biggest advantage of this game is of course the freedom. You can do basically whatever you want, from racing on small fiats 500 to tuning your ferrari 599XX Evo to go 500kph. There is an endless amount of activities, cars and fun in this game. You can try a lot of different cars youve probably seen in movies or always wanted to have. From 1930s racing cars to cyberpunk quadra v-tech, only you choose what to drive. My personal best if Ford GT40 Mk II. Despite being a arcade game, it has options to turn this game into semi-simulator. You can adjust your tire pressure, gearbox, antiroll bars and other stuff if you want. Also this game has a very good system of difficulty. There are many AI difficulties as well as assists, if you turn off some of them, you get more credits from the race.
The game has amazing multiplayer. Apart from freeroam with random players, there are: team games, battle royale (sort of), regular races, championships and head-to-head races.

In conclusion, i love this game.

Middle difficulties also work out in one of two ways: Either they don't put up a fight at all, or 1 or 2 of them shoot way out ahead and the rest don't put up a fight
Unbeatable difficulty is just a demo-derby with physics defying cars that miss the checkpoints by half a mile....",0,1,0,

9040,"Although I first started racing games with F1 2008, I also played NFS games a lot. I never really liked the Forza Horizon or Forza Motorsport series because of the popularity of NFS at the time, but after playing Forza Horizon 3 and 4, I realized that I had made a huge mistake. First of all, I liked that Turn10 and Playground Games came up with two different Forza series to the players: While Forza Motorsport mostly includes competitions on F1 tracks, the Horizon series includes open world races and most likely the developers will come up with a new Forza Motorsport in 2020.

Forza Horizon 4 may be one of the greatest games I've ever played, as I've never played a racing game in the last 3-4 years, for its visual feast, gameplay, optimization, endless activities, and more. The intro of Horizon 4 has a perfect opening that I have perhaps never seen in any game: When you first enter the game, you participate in the race with Mclaren Senna, the car named after the F1 driver (Ayrton Senna de Silva) who died during the race in the 1994 San Marino GP. it introduces its beautiful landscapes and in a way teaches the mechanics in the game. After racing with Mclaren Senna for a while, we move on to the ""Winter"" season of the game after a small animation transition. In winter, we use a powerful pickup truck instead of Mclaren Senna, and the game introduces you to how difficult the winter season is. After racing for a while with the truck that the game gives you, we pass to the ""Spring"" season and things get more and more interesting here. We are controlling one of the rally cars in the summer and there are motorcyclists as our competitors. When I first saw this event, “Or can we ride a motorcycle?!” I lost my mind, but unfortunately we couldn't drive. After the rally race against motorcyclists is over, we enter the ""Summer"" season with the Mclaren Senna car that he introduced at the beginning of the game, and we have finished the race at the Horizon Festival, as in other games of Forza Horizon.",1,1,1,

9166,"Forza Horizon 4 retains almost everything that made Forza Horizon 3 the best racer in its class and bakes it into a game that doesn’t ever want you to stop playing. The stunning visual quality and sound design, the massive array of automobiles, and the extensive and completely customisable career mode that have become hallmarks of the Horizon series are all here. What’s new is just how much more effectively Forza Horizon 4 encourages us to return thanks to its shifting seasons, regularly refreshed challenges, and steady stream of rewards.
Every real-time week the in-game season will change and bring a whole new look to the world, alongside a bunch of season-specific challenges. Every day there are still more new Forzathon challenges to complete, and every hour there is a live, online event to participate in alongside up to 11 other drivers who we work with cooperatively in order to chip away at a shared goal.
All of this is on top of what’s essentially the traditional Horizon experience: dozens, and dozens, and dozens of races and activities spread across a host of disciplines. Racing, rally, drift, drag, editing your own events with Horizon Blueprint: the lot. With this many cars, this much customisation, and a never-ending stream of things to do, it seems Forza Horizon 4 wants to prove being here for a good time AND a long time aren’t mutually exclusive.
Midlands Madness
This is all largely made possible by Horizon 4’s new default nature as an online, shared-world racer where all the other non-traffic cars cruising the open world are human players. We still race against AI – unless you elect to race with or against friends and such – but you’ll be sharing the open world itself with the rest of us, doing our own thing.
It’s not unlike a more intimate version of The Crew, though the difference is it’s not compulsory. You can play entirely offline if you want, and being knocked offline for any reason isn’t an issue, either, because it’s smart enough to seamlessly transition between its offline and online state in the background while you continue playing. It happened to me a couple of times and there was no loss of progress at all.",1,1,1,

9181,"I'm reviewing this as someone coming back to the series after a long time away. Last Forza game I played was Forza Motorsport 4, which came out in 2011. I used an Xbox 360 controller to play, I got the cheapest version available and I got it on sale.

I absolutely adore Horizon 4. Even without DLC, it hands you cars like candy and hoo boy are there a LOT of cars. I think it says there are around 700? While a lot of them can be lumped into categories that largely feel the same, and many cars are indeed just the same car built in a different year, I'm amazed at the sheer variety on display here. You'll be hard pressed to not find something you find enjoyable if you like driving cars in games at all, whether that be ultra fast, ultra maneuverable little things that seem like they belong on an f1 track, literally the car you drive to work every day, or some Mad Max lookin' frankencar bouncing over dirt hills. Some of the easiest ways to get a lot of variety rather quickly is through the Stories and Businesses, found on the yellow icons on the map, though I'm admittedly unsure as to what exactly unlocks these. 

I haven't interacted much with the multiplayer aspect yet, but it looks like you can do co-op events where you and other players try to earn so many points in such and such time threshold, you can play content created by other users where they'll stick you in one of their cars and challenge you to do something with it like a jump or get from point A to B really fast. The best I saw of that was an obstacle course I need to see about finding the code for. There's also a competitive side of course, I've no doubt you can race other players somehow, and I'm sure I saw some demolition derby kinda thing going on. I can't speak on them as I haven't sought them out really.

Most of my time has been just driving different cars around England (which included plenty of moments especially shortly after launching the game where I didn't realize I was driving on the wrong side of the road) and occasionally racing AI or doing other such singleplayer content. But for that purpose, this has been absolutely delightful.",1,1,1,

9294,"Forza Horizon 4 is by far one of the most polished and entertaining racing games to date and my absolute personal favorite.

Horizon 4 is a gorgeous open world game which takes place in Great Britain with locations like Ambleside, Broadway and the main star of the show – Scotland’s capital – Edinburgh. It is the first game in the series with not only dynamic weather and day/night cycles but now all 4 seasons of the year. Seasons cycle weekly and drastically change the way the entire game looks and plays out.

Driving in Horizon 4 is a near perfect balance between arcade and simulation. Physics feel realistic and on point all throughout the game no matter what type of content you're doing. The amount of things to do in this game is mind boggling. Horizon 4 has one of the biggest car lists out there with more than 700 vehicles total as of 2021. There are 2 great DLC expansions that add even more content to an already massive base game. The Fortune Island is, in my opinion, the greatest DLC of any racing game ever.

Mind you, Horizon 4 has a couple of flaws. Some of the engine sounds are just plain inaccurate. While performance tuning is plentiful I would have loved to see more visual customization - Need for Speed Heat and The Crew 2 are miles ahead in this department. Although Forza is one of the few games that managed to solve the problems of wall riding and ramming in online play making it far more enjoyable and competitive the stability of online servers is questionable.

From performance point of view the game is really well optimized with requirements even lower than the last game in the series. Game does occasionally suffer from pop-in regardless of how good your setup might be, though nothing game breaking.

This review comes from my 500+ hours of experience on Microsoft Store. I bought a second copy of the ultimate edition on steam without hesitating for a second.",1,1,1,

If you find a group of people you're having fun with, start a convoy. I was in a really fun drifting session, and then I got instantly reconnected to another server without warning. I could almost thumbs down this review for ruining my wholesome moment, but I still love the Forza franchise none-the-less.

This entry is a massive improvement over FH3, haven't experienced any game breaking bugs. FH3 had the ""invisible wall of death"" when traveling over 200+ MPH. You'd hit this wall, all of the other AI cars would pile up, and explode. And this was with the same high end PC I'm using to play this game.

This is also the first game I've EVER actually liked the idea of being Online-Only. It makes the game a boat load of fun. I just ran into a pair of guys taking photos on a bridge with a Ford Crown Victoria police car, and a Bugatti Chiron. Pretty effin cool.

Love the world and the detail it provides, the seasons are also a nice touch and a welcome addition to keep the sequels interesting. 

Catch this game with the Ultimate bundle when it's on sale, you can't go wrong. (That's when I finally bought it post Steam release)

10/10 almost not looking forward to the release of FH5 and the inevitable death of this game's online community.

**EDIT** I've been an avid Sim Racer for quite some years now, I do not recommend using your rig for this game as it is a rather numb experience.

9419,"In my opinion, Horizon 4 is the best racing game of all time. 

I grew up playing racing sims (f1 1998, GTR, GTR2, GT legends, Colin McRay and Dirt Rally, and some more recent ones like project cars and aseto corsa) but i also really enjoyed arcade racers, anything from NFS 2 to Most Wanted (Porsche Unleashed is my favorite). With all that said, I must admit that I became far more laid back recently and I really started playing Forza Motorsport since the 3rd installment. I really enjoyed how Forza always looked passionate about cars (though probably not as much about Motorsport, ironic as it may be... Grand Turismo is an awesome game that’s far more focused on the actual Motorsport, the 1st grand Turismo is the game that got me into racing games, I adore them all). Anyway, I remember playing FM4 and loving every second of it (especially the top gear/Jeremy Clarkson part) and all thinking that a street racing version of Forza would be my dream game... a game that I can play with a control but still feel thing’s like weight transfer. Well my dreams came 1 and I adored FH1. 

Enough about the background, Horizon 4 is a stunning game with an incredible car selection and awesome racing. It even pays tribute to other famous racing games in a way that made me emotional (something I never thought a racing game could do). It plays with nostalgia but who cares?! It does it in a very respectful, almost adoring way that you can’t help but like. 

 If you are anything like me, you will love this game. It’s obvious not rFactor or even Grand Tourismo, so don’t expect that. But if you are looking for a fun street racing game that makes cars actually feel as realistic as they can feel with a controller, I think this is the best game ever.",1,1,1,

The seasons changing is really great idea where the scenery changes and, it actually makes a difference to how cars perform on-road or off-road. In terms of customizing your cars, it's not really deep and it doesn't have a lot of variety like I hoped it would be but, it still pretty good. For major DLCs is not really great except treasure island which was really fun.

Now for some downside. When it launched on steam it had a lot of stuttering but later they fixed it but after a month or more (can't remember now). The game is really slow in transitioning when you play online races (similar to GTA V cloud screen) which made me really hate to race online. The unskippable ads for the game DLCs are absolutely infuriating and ridiculous. I don't understand how they thought this is ok and reasonable.

If you are really into cars, racing or just enjoy driving in general then I'd say get it when it's on discount as I feel like it is much overpriced on steam in comparison to other stores that sell this game for pc.

9498,"This game really has a bad sense of direction. After the first two hours you'll end up wondering what you're even supposed to do. The game gives no clues on what events you should do, how the car system works, and the story is non-existent.

[h1]Pros:[/h1]
But that's also one of the things that makes this game unique. For better or for worse. FH4 is a total sandbox where any player can do whatever they want whenever they want. You can finish the story missions or skip them entirely and start fine tuning your cars or chasing leaderboards. The difficulty can be adjusted at any time and can scale from beginner to expert. Events pop up frequently with rare rewards that give you an incentive to complete them or again, you can just skip them and focus on what you were currently doing. The game works how you want it to work. 

[h1]Cons:[/h1]
This however does have its downsides. As I mentioned, the story isn't really there at all and you'll always have to decide what you want to do as the game never guides you. The progression system is also just bad as the cars and money you'll get are totally random. Depending on your preferences you might hate this game or love it. Still, Forza Horizon 4 is a seriously well crafted game and still has hours of content to complete and thousands of active players even after so many years from its initial release.

[h1]Forza Horizon 5:[/h1]
However, [b]do not[/b] get this game if you haven't yet played Forza Horizon 5. FH5 is the sequel to this game and has so much more new content, improvements, a better story and a level of graphics and immersion that makes FH4 look like it was from two generations ago. FH4 is still a worthwhile game to get but only do it if you have already bought FH5 and want even more Forza. Also, in some regions this game is way too overpriced so you might want to avoid it and just get FH5 instead.",1,1,1,

So instead of pulling the wheel left to turn left, you'll actually be pulling the wheel RIGHT while turning LEFT in order to stop the wheel from turning itself all the way to the left and vice versa.

Simply UNPLAYABLE.

Car physics feel way too arcade-y for me (I've been playing Project Cars 2 and Dirt Rally 2.0 without assists to give you an idea of my background). Cars are far too stable in braking, mid corner oversteer due to throttle input seems to be far too amplified, and overall gameplay seems to focus on straight line braking.

Game progression is really lame too...loot boxes, and the such. Sure its a big map, but you'll never remember any bit of it without spending thousands of hours the way the game throws you around it.

-Graphics: 10/10
Satisfying because of good optimization, but we have a downgrade when compared to the horizon 3
At least you get 60fps!

-Driving Physics: 9/10
Better than today's racing games as an arcade open-world game. i like to play it on hardest difficulty.
But offroad physics sucks!! it does not give you the feeling of driving off-road

-Car Customization: 5/10
The worst part of this game,is really awful especially when you put 5.2 liter audi r8 engine on a muscle car!

-Car Tuning: 9/10
It's great if you tune cars by yourself!

-Gameplay: 10/10
Great for chilling at late night!
Perfect and flawless.

-Audio: 5/10
The worst part after car customization is audio, engine sounds are repetitious &
artificial! you can't build your dream car!
Just listen to the Dodge Viper GTS engine sound!!!

-Musics and Soundtracks: 7/10
MainMenu music It will take you to heaven, but in game radio is not good as other racing games!
Radio DJ Is soulless especially when skill song plays!
I wish we could add our favorite musics to the game like gta

-PC Requirements: 10/10
It is admirable! nice job!

-Grind: 9/10
Designed to keep you playing for as long as possible.
But after a long time it becomes boring!

-Story: -/-
There is no story section

-Price: 8/10
Wait for a big discount but i suggest you to buy Forza Horizon 5 instead.
It is still more valuable than other Racing games

-Bugs: 7/10
Annoying bugs, It spoils the experience

-Singleplayer Mode: 10/10
Excellent and inimitable

-Multiplayer Mode: 4/10
Worst servers i ever seen! online adventures are awful!! sometimes makes to you wait more than 15 minutes! but free-roam is enjoyable!

-Characters: 6/10
Not good, you can't customize your character whatever you like! character dances are not salty (reminds me fortnite dances lol)
Your character can not talk and the animations are repetitive

9595,"I recommend you try the game before buying, as for me it was a total nightmare. It took a full week to download, and when it was finally in my library downloaded and installed, I had a graphics problem I had not encountered in any other of the dozen games I possess; Whited out screen. I mean, it was barely OK to drive at night, as I was able to see at least where I was going, but at any other time of the day all I could see was White everywhere. Now, I believe it not to be a GPU problem, since all the other apps on my PC work perfectly (including games). But still it ruined my game experience and that merely explains the low hours-on-record metric. I am not planning on downloading it again except if steam does sth about this problem.

Edit 9/12/21: Just bought and installed the Sapphire Radeon RX 6600 (non XT) with 8GB of VRAM. The game runs smoothly at medium settings with 60FPS. I got to enjoy it properly at last...

Problem with the white-out screen I believe it was due to low VRAM of the processor's integrated graphics. 
I go now and then on the metrics overlay and see it utilizes about 4.2GB of VRAM in  these settings. No wonder it was unplayable with 2GB of VRAM.",1,0,0,

Also you can race the Aston Martin from Goldfinger against LEGO cars and Hot Wheels and that's just delightful.",1,1,1,

9700,"You know what? I'm gonna say it. Fuck this game. Match making for 5 fucking hours. Shitty team balancing. Fuck off physics, getting stuck in rocks or ramps with no recovery system. Disconnects give no rewards for already completed matches. Between matches I am finishing a new fucking 4 year degree.

Did I really get trolled into buying this game at 50% off? Fucking stole it from me like I was brain dead. 

Now I'm kicked from my match because it makes sense for a match to load in 20 min and kick you in 20 sec of inactivity (distracted, writing this shit review). So after I type this, I wait for another fuck off match? Another pandemic would probably roll by before the next match.

Fuck you for leaving this game in this state for years. Fuck you for releasing a new one with this shit as your legacy.

Fuck you, my game is frozen trying to quit.

Not constructive criticism? Not a constructive review? You (devs) must be bloody thick because, after years of community feedback, we are already beyond that.

Regardless, thank you for reading. Take this fucking disaster game down.

--------------
Below is original review before I fucking lost it.

Not many reviews have mentioned the broken online functionality.

To the current development studio team:

Fix your online issues. Constant disconnects, long match-making times, bugged match-making etc.
 
You already know these issues exist. These have all been known and reported within the player base.

I do not need to elaborate. Fix them or this becomes testament to the disaster FH5 will be.",0,0,1,

This game even brought me so much happiness that enjoy all kinds of cars, brought me pleasure that communicate with my friends to play together, brought me exciting that get a good feeling and improve my pressure in my life. Remembered a summer, I drove a blue Jesko car to run the road, It was wonderful for me to admire the good environment and enjoy happiness for running the car rapidly. compare fifth game or this game, I think this game is better since this game brought me feeling is more beautiful, even though better game come on, I also don't give up, I have a good memories for this game.

9718,"It's like the Crew 2 with better graphics, more realistic driving, and then worse everything else. 

The menus are cumbersome, it takes forever to do anything, the load times are frequent and long, the effort that goes into getting into a multiplayer group is way too much.

Here's an example of an experience I had last night: Invite friend to group > they can join group but not my game > Game tells me to join them instead > Reform group with me joining them > Load into their session > Drive to a race to do together > Our seasons are desynced for some reason, have to wait for my season to change > Get into race > Race last 3 minutes > Wait for my season to change back > Repeat for next race.  

After managing to even get into the same lobby, it's about 10 minutes worth of work and load screens to do a 3 minute race, just to repeat it after. 

Also worth pointing out, I'm on a very high end system, so I don't think this is based on my pc, the game is just cumbersome. 

There are also a lot of times where the NPCs force your map open, and just won't shut up, and your just sitting there waiting to be allowed to go back to doing whatever you were doing before.

The game also throws free cars at you to the point that you never really feel like you have to work for anything. 5 hours in, and my car collection is already massive, beyond just what the DLC gives you. The amount of cars you get from wheel spins in crazy. The same goes for the games currency, you make more from wheel spins than you do playing the actual game.
This was all pretty disappointing, because I picked this up wanting another open world racing game to play, and thought this looked amazing. I hope they can clean some of this stuff up for Horizon 5.

This game definitely has some really strong points to, but overall didn't add enough to make me have a good time. 

Some things I really liked about the game were: The car tuning system. Being able to custom tweak your car to get exactly the performance you want, or being able to import other peoples tunings if you don't want to learn how to do it yourself is an amazing idea. Some cars that are cool to look at but generally would under perform can be made into absolute monsters with this system. 

The Name system where you can pick your name and have the NPC's use it in dialogue or on your GPS was a nice touch I really liked.

The amount of cosmetics for your avatar where awesome, though I wish there were more faces/hairstyles for them because they look jank.

The game is visually stunning. I prefer the Crew 2 over this game by a mile, and think the Crew 2 looks great, but this game is just unbelievable visually. 

Having houses you can buy and travel to is a neat concept, but without being able to walk around them or have cars displayed, it really just feels like a way for them to force you to drive somewhere to access certain menus as opposed to a cool feature.

I also wish the weather progressed faster, the seasons system is a cool concept, but if you end up hating one of the seasons, having to play on it for a week at a time is rough.

I also feel like the map is very small. For an open world game, there really isn't much diversity, and you can get across the map pretty quickly.

I don't mean to sound like a hater, because I really want to love this game, it just makes it really hard. I'll definitely be picking up Horizon 5 in hopes that they've improved on a lot of things, but I don't think there's any reason to pick this one up.",0,1,0,

The drifting and dirt racing physics have got to be some of the best I've played and the best part about it, my broke @$$ can play it on a controller cuz I can't afford a wheel! I've never really been big on road racing but the grind made me feel as if I should expand my *HORIZONS* even though it isn't necessarily REQUIRED to progress through the game. It's nice to have options. I will say, Forza's been really ticking me off with giving me exclusively horns and emotes in the wheel spins rather than credits or a car or a pair of pants that aren't women's sparkly leggings. Still, I give it a 10/10. Can't get bored of it. I only have a few hours but I noticed in the first two days of owning it I was GLUED to it.

9884,"The Good:
The core gameplay (driving) is good. It can be customized to be more arcade-like or more sim-like, depending on what you want. There are more arcade-like games out there (e.g. Need for Speed series) and there are more sim-like games (Assetto Corsa) but this game hits the perfect balance of both. Like if you only had space for 1 racing game in your library, this is a good choice.

The game support Ultra Widescreen resolutions quite well, but you can tell it didn't start out that way and Ultra Widescreen support was just added along the way. The splash, intro and cut scenes are not in ultrawide. But all the core gameplay modes support ultrawide and the game looks great in it.
It makes me want to invest in a racing wheel and building my own racing cockpit for the sim-like experience, but unfortunately there's not enough space in our house for a setup like that. But that's an option for people to get a more realistic ""driving sim"" experience. It'll be a safe environment for the wife to practice driving 🙂.

The sceneries are gorgeous. In between intense racing, you could just sort of drive around, admiring the views. There are many moments where I'm driving to my next mission, but there's a vista or beauty spot I happen to pass through (driving along a beach, or a waterfall) and I have to stop to take a few pictures. It's a nice change of pace from all the breakneck racing. This is what separates it from all the other racing games out there, IMO. It has a photography mini-game.

Speaking of mini-games, there are lots of options to earn money in the game aside from winning races. I created a design for my own cars and made it public. A few days later, I was pleasantly surprised to find ""Design Reward"" messages in my inbox saying I earned 100 credits for each time my design was downloaded and used by other players. There's also a taxi business I invested 100,00 credits into, and it's slowly earning back the in-game credits I invested. There's also an auction house for cars, but the implementation is better than it was in Diablo 3, in that it wasn't short-circuiting player progression. Cars are so easy to acquire, there's no real need to go to the auction house unless it's for a particular rare car you're looking for.🙂
Drew and I bought this game to get a preview of what Forza 5 Horizons might look like, and so far I'm not disappointed.

The Bad:
The UI is a bit cluttered. It took me some time to get used to it. I thought there was no quick way to go to your garage to customize a car you just bought, but it was just hidden in one of the tabs. There are fast travel options to some destinations, but not all. When completing races, new destinations will pop up on the world map, and over time this WILL make the world map super cluttered.
The not-so-bad:
Car acquisition and collection is easy.
Car customization is not as extensive as in Need for Speed Underground. You can only paint the body, hood, side mirrors, spoiler and tint the windows. So far I haven't seen an option to purchase body kits, unless it already came with the car.
Car upgrading and tuning is not as extensive as Gran Turismo 2, but it comes close. You can adjust gear ratios to balance acceleration vs top speed. I haven't dived too deeply into it, but there are options to tune the tires, alignment, antiroll bars, springs, damping, aero, brakes and differential.
If you stop a multi-race session (e.g. a story mission that has 10 races), there's no easy way to just pick up from where you left off. The game will drop you off in your Home starting point, and you have to drive all the way to where you picked up the mission to resume it.
There's no unified, cohesive storyline. Just chapters that pop up all over the place 😃.
This being a game released in 2018, there's a lot of content to grind through, and someone new to the game will feel a bit overwhelmed by all the content.

The Ugly:
Online Multiplayer with friends.

It’s kinda funny though, since my history with the Forza Horizon series is a bit more complicated than that. I played and loved the first game when it came out, mostly enjoyed the second (even though I admittedly played the much weaker Xbox 360 version) and absolutely loathed Forza Horizon 3. I don’t know what exactly it was about that one that drove me crazy. Was it the characters that wouldn’t stop nagging you about activities you should be doing? Probably. Maybe it was the map that felt more like a diorama rather than a real place. Perhaps it was the horrible PC port performance, or the experience that was trying to download it through Microsoft’s store front, only for the download to fail and you had to redownload all that data all over again. The more I think about it, it was probably all of those things combined, a perfect storm that pushed me to just uninstall it shortly after Blizzard Mountain came out. I remember telling myself that the only way I would ever try Forza Horizon again was if it came to Steam. At the time, I figured that was a pipe dream, but I’m glad I was wrong.

The thing is, Forza Horizon 4 is itself pretty similar to Forza Horizon 3, in terms of structure at least. Where Horizon 3 pushed the series away from having a linear story and more towards being a sandbox of sorts, Horizon 4 takes that and refines it to a near perfect sheen that then inches itself a bit closer to turning this series into a AAA budget Test Drive Unlimited successor, complete with houses you can buy and drivers you can play dress up with. Some would say they’re pointless additions, but I’ve had way more fun dressing my driver up to be ridiculously flashy and pairing that up with crazy looking cars than I initially thought possible. It’s a fun little “life sim-lite” touch that you don’t even really have to engage with if you don’t want to; just put on a helmet and racing suit when you get them and be on your way. That being said, the houses are really just glorified fast travel points here, so I’d love to see them fleshed out more in a future game, especially since the rest of the game is practically flawless.

As for the core racing and driving gameplay itself? Yes, you still get nagged about new races, PR stunts, and other activities, but only for the first time they appear; from then on, the game just lets you do what you want and have fun. I know some people think the map is too samey and bland, but personally I love it; it feels like a smaller, more local stop on a bigger, grander tour. For me, it’s been such a delight cruising around, especially as the seasons change, that it’s made me look forward to Forza Horizon 5 that much more, to see how it fits a more diverse map into this super solid formula. Of course Steam, in terms of being a game download client, is miles ahead of the Windows Store. However, this version did have some very weird performance problems at launch; constant micro-stuttering, some annoying crashes out of the blue. As of a few months ago though, it’s felt rock solid to me, but YMMV.

I mentioned earlier that Forza Horizon is more of a sandbox these days, but I had no idea it would be this addicting all these years later. That’s part of why I’m finally getting around to writing a review after over 300 hours played since its Steam release; because as much as there are other games I could be playing, I still find myself looking at the Festival Playlist each week and thinking to myself, “Yeah, why not do another Trial championship for a truck I already have? I could just sell it later.” That’s just how fun the driving is in this game, that I want to keep playing it, unlike the previous game in the series that I had to force myself to push on instead.

[b]TLDR:[/b] Believe the hype. Forza Horizon 4 is one of the best racing games on PC, period. The driving is sublime, there’s tons of cars to collect and customize to your heart’s content, and the game has so many different ways of driving and racing around (road, dirt, street scene, cross country, Super7 community challenges, that battle royale mode “The Eliminator” that is way more fun than you would think) that this really is a nearly perfect racing paradise. Even with Forza Horizon 5 around the corner, there’s still so much here to play with and enjoy, even if you just pick it up for the time being until the new one comes out, that I could never not recommend it.",1,1,1,

Car balance is atrocious. You can enter a race with a same graded car as someone else and his car is a rocket compared to yours, stupid and unrealistic and means you are forced out of using 99% of the cars in the game if you want to compete online since only a small percentage of broken cars get spammed by losers that suck at the game.
Community is toxic and online play I strongly advise against.

It's a great game as long as you dont want hard simulation. But's its no arcade racer, the sim and mod options are significant - it can be what you want it to be as long as you don't need to go full-on Asseto Corsa.

Very fun, loads of cars, loads of challenges both one player and online, working and still popular servers and achievement options out of your ears if you like that sort of thing. 

FH5 is due out soon but I'll bet that there wont be much reduction in FH4 players for a while yet, but hopefully a reduction on price. If you can get this at a good deal, play it through to prep for FH5 

Performance excellent: Maximum settings no problem with i7-6700k, GTX 1080 vanilla, 32GB RAM - more than 70FPS at all times, 1440k monitor

Hope this helps, enjoy!

9931,"Best Car game in the world, hands down.",1,1,1,
9932,"I grew up with a brother that loved the Forza Motorsports games (we had FM2 for our Xbox) but I thought it was very boring. Cars and tuning have been a bit of an obsession over the last couple years but I don't have my own project car or performance machine yet. Instead of beating too hard on my little Chev Sonic I decided to pull the trigger on Horizon 4 and it was a fantastic idea! It checks almost all the boxes for me. It's a gorgeous game, the seasonal changes are beautiful, there's more cars than I could have imagined, and there is loads of content. I have no doubt that driving a FH4 car is leaps and bounds different than driving the same car IRL -- even with a gaming wheel, pedal set, and shifter -- but it's very fun to imagine it so.

There are a couple of personal gripes. I feel like accumulating credits is a little too easy, as is adding loads of power to a basic car. After your first 8-10 races, you could buy a 4-banger with 120hp and load it up with a racing V8, twin turbos, AWD, and racing slicks bringing it from a low B class to a high S1 class. Personally, I have been playing with my own sets of ""project car"" rules: buy a classic project car (240sx, Civic, Miata, Mustang, GTI, etc) and give it a shoddy paint job with rust spots and mismatched panels, plus a couple little mods like intake and ignition. Every race you win grants you money to spend on it: 5,000 for 1st, 3,000 for 2nd, and 1,000 for first. Placing 10th, 11th, and 12th makes you lose 1,000, 2,000, and 3,000 respectively. Paint jobs cost 10,000 and drivetrain/engine swaps cost 25,000 regardless of what it is. Everything else is fair game. It makes me feel more like I'm rowing through the advancements of upgrades, closer to what owning a project race car might be like. Again, it's fun to imagine!

Another issue I have is how the map is set. The content in plentiful, but convoluted and distracting. Every race you win gives you three more in its category. After winning three or four in each category the map is chock full of ""NEW"" badges, not to mention all of the ""beauty spots"", ""influencer boards"", and ""fast travel boards"", PLUS the ""danger signs"", ""speed traps"", and ""drift zones"". I understand you can filter out any unwanted categories for the map but I believe most of those should be off as default.

I, again, praise this game again. I built my PC four years ago with definitely not top-of-the-line parts but it continues to run this game beautifully, even with Spotify playing and Chrome in the background. The music choices in the built-in radio are awesome (plus featuring my favorite local rap collective, Shredders! Shoutout to my MPLS folks). The seasonal challenges are widely varied and exciting. I simply love it.

I expect to be buying FH5, though not in the first 6-12 months of its release. I still have much to explore :)

EDIT: I would like to add BUY A CONTROLLER. I tried with keyboard/mouse and it kind of ruined my first few hours of play time. FH4 tried to make it work but it's just not enjoyable. I bought a ""Forty4 Wireless Gaming Controller"" on Amazon for $37 and it made a world of difference.",1,1,1,

It would be nice if there was a description next to the different versions telling you what you get. The other thing that is quite annoying is the fact when your playing the game from time to time it will run a 15 second advert for the dlcs which is rather annoying, same for the fact the dlc items are always on the map and you cant turn them off in map menu, there only use is free fast travel across the map.

This is literally the best arcade racing game ever: a hell of a lot of cars (you definitely will never drive all of them), handful amount of tracks, stories and a bunch of different activities throughout the map. Oh, and goddamn police is nowhere is sight! As well as there is no ""Fast and furious"" level plot no one asked for (seriously, thank god there is no story, just an idea of festival and no more).

Britain in game isn't quite accurate but looks gorgeous nonetheless. Graphics are simply astonishing and produce magnificent screenshots.

Radio stations provide some quality music, but for three hundred hours they have too few tracks. And DJs are funny enough too. 

If you're hungry for more races, there are weekly seasonal events. It's a good opportunity to win some rare and hard to find cars. Even I of all people, who hate daily/weekly/whatever repeatable activities, enjoy seasonal championships. They force you to explore your garage and choose cars that you'll never drive otherwise.

On the other hand we have Horizon Life server, Online Adventures and Playgrounds. The server isn't stable, game often loses connection with it, loading between two online races in Adventures or Playgrounds may take an eternity. And on top of that Online races are flooded with rammers, ""meta cars"" and douchebags.

Or they were way to proud with every single feature of the game that they just felt you had to pay to skip them. With in-game currency or your time.

10044,"Excellent game, loads to do and plenty of different cars to test out / customise and plenty of different race modes from rallying to drag racing and everything in between. I would advise getting the Fortune Island DLC as it's a brilliant addition but also lets you win lots of money to buy all the cars quickly.

+ Best racing game I've played
+ Excellent graphics including perfect modelling of different cars, great and varied environments (including changing seasons) and excellent sense of speed
+ Awesome selection of cars including muscle cars, racing cars, super cars, drift cars & concepts
+ Great sound track / voice acting
+ Great physics and option to use clutch with manual gears
+ Plenty to do, I've done 85 hrs and only done about 70%
+ Other human players appear in your game but are 'ghosts' so they can't ram you off the road and ruin your game

- playable characters are a bit limited and wear awful clothes and do stupid victory dances if you let them
- little bit ""woke"" but not as bad as some games
- gets a bit samey after a while although plenty of different race styles to keep it fresh",1,1,1,

I have solid, consistent internet, LAN connected, 200Mb's+ never had a single problem in years of gaming that has resulted from my internet connection.  One morning It signed me out of the server and i selected to play offline. I played all day, collecting cars, winning races. Signed on the next day to find none of the progress has saved and it instead reverted me back to where i had last played online. 

Brilliant game but cant get the fundamentals right. Im still scratching my head to figure out if this is a steam issue or a game issue. Be wary if you flick between online and offline, after research i have found that the problem is quite common. 
Refund requested as i can't trust that this wont happen again and im not wasting anymore hours and effort.

10058,"> Yes it is still good game after all these years, they still update and put challenges and prizes every week. (its also a plus that the season changes every week too) 
> Great car models and the character inside it doesnt look like a wood or something (also the character customization is also a plus)
> The scenery is beautiful, the map size is just right, not too large but not too small.
> It is jam-packed with events and you can try online adventure if you want to be competitive with other players (if that teredo BS will not break)(Yes, I tried to fix it with commands and tinkering the services but I don't want to mess with my routers settings)
> One of the best handling physics that I ever tried, not too arcady but not too simulatorish. You need to brake to turn or you'll land on a ditch.
> I'm pissed I cant put anime liveries on my car because of that teredo BS. (also I cant play online with others, I play only for 3-4 days after the game broke)
> Car flipper simulator (but you can still earn by playing it the way it meant to be, flipping cars is just more efficient way to make some dough)

10111,"First of all, it's controller oriented. On the wheel you should watch a video about the exact recommended settings, but even then it won't feel as good as beamng, assetto corsa or other driving games. The Force Feedback is also really bad in my case, because instead of trying to bring the wheel to the center the game wants the wheel to go to the side, I fixed it via Thrustmaster Control Panel, letting the wheel decide the FFB, instead of the game. It's still enjoyable with steering wheel but it really is more fun with a controller.
If you are on controller however, I definitely recommend this game (I still do with a wheel but you might encounter these problems).
The game has visually stunning graphics, good physics for an ""Arcade"" driving game and a vast, long gameplay. It is fun trying to get all the nice cars, having a wheelspin every level-up and just all-in-all driving. There are many races available (rally, street etc) and other story oriented stuff which give you money, it's really fun, would definitely recommend.",1,0,0,

10214,"I love cars. And naturally after watching tons of videos on YouTube showing driving in Forza Horizon 4 I decided to get this game. I don't even know where to start. Anyway. 1) You can't turn off the stupid voice over, you can turn it down to 1. And whenever the voice starts even when it is on the lowest volume everything else is sort of muted to a point where you can't even hear the engine properly. And if you're driving manual that is irritating. 2) The engine sounds are horrible. More about this later. 3) Online. It's a very intense moment between you and a Ferrari. The finish line is getting closer but you were racing each other side by side the entire time. You're approaching to the final corner when all of a sudden the game freezes... So you have to open the task manager and end the process because obviously nothing else works. There have been lots of crashes lately. 4) The tuning. It doesn't make any sense at all. So, let's say, you like an X car and you spend hour after hour making it better. Making it as good as possible. The best in A class. You fine tune everything that's possible. And finally you are ready to race it. But wait! What's happened? An Atomic Punk(whatever that is) just beat you? OK, Maybe it was a very experienced player. Let's try again. WHAT?! Again? Beaten by 2 Atomic Punks that came first and second. It's useless... There are only one or two cars in a certain class that can win online. The rest of 500 or so cars aren't simply fast enough. 5) Tuning 2.0. You can make any car 4wd which is obviously required otherwise you won't win any race. You can put the same v8 or v12 or any other engine in every car so naturally they will all sound the same - horrible. 6) Clothing. I know in this day and age it's very tolerant to put short skirts on men but this is a racing game, a car game. I don't need a million types of clothing(which are actually the same things only with different colors) especially when I'm not even going to walk my character. What's the point? Really? The only good outfit is The Stig's outfit. That's it! I mean you can be The Stig for crying out loud. 7) It's too generous. When I first started playing and the game made me choose one of the three cars for the rest of the career (at least I thought that way) I was thinking for a long time before I made a choice. And after 1 hour or so I have a Bugatti. And then a McLaren. And then 400000. At no point during my playtime did I think ""oh, I need money for that"". You're a millionaire from the start. *) There is so much more that I haven't included that make no sense whatsoever and will eventually drive you crazy.

10284,"I love this game, and had hundreds more hours on the Xbox. All in all, I would give this game a 8/10. There is an insane amount of cars to collect and tune however you want. The world is pretty, although it'll feel very samey after a while and there is no dedicated race track (wtf). 

I really like this game, but here are the things I dislike:

- Engine noises are awful. Like, really awful. Any X class car (basically super cars) sounds like a rattling tin can.
- No sense of progression. Unlike games like Need for Speed, you don't really have to work for a really good car. You're given cars like candy, especially this far into the game's lifecycle with all the bonus wheelspins, and I got 1 million credits right of the bat from spins. Personally, I just like collecting cars so this isn't an issue for me, but many people won't like it.
- A ton of cool cars are locked behind wheelspins, essentially free lootboxes. If you want a car really bad and it's behind a wheelspin just look at the auction house. The RNG gods are never kind. Again, wheelspins are free and cannot be bought (good).

10289,"I really like Forza Horizon 4. It's not as realistic as other racing sims out there but I like the arcade part. I like upgrading my cars up to the limit allowed and tweaking it to just get that slight edge that makes you win the race.

The map is pretty big and it's fun to explore new areas. You'll see most of the map if you do all races and stories. 

Apart from racing there's also other game modes where you can play battle royale, infection, capture the flag and other style games with other players.

Most of the story missions are alright but some are just annoying but thankfully just have to be done once and they give decent rewards when completed.

There are also a few annoyances about FH4: once in a while you'll have to restart the game because some mechanics stop working (like rewind will suddenly stop working in the middle of a race or even in free roam), online session will not be able to connect, online (ranked) matchmaking can sometimes take ages to find players, especially ranked can sometimes take like 20-30 minutes if you're unlucky. 

Many cheaters/modders/hackers ruin the gameplay by getting impossible results in races/speedtraps/etc leaderboards. It's been like this for ever and nothing is being done to remove the clearly cheated numbers like driving 9.000 km/h through a speedtrap or finish a 6 km race in 0.05 seconds. I wish these people would get banned/accounts deleted and their entries removed from the leaderboards. It's been a long-term complaint from the community but it's very obvious the developers couldn't care less because they have never bothered to fix or do anything about it.

Also the winter season sucks, don't bother doing storyline or regular races in winter because you'll have to adapt to the snow but still be expected to perform equally as if the road isn't a big ice rink. 

I would recommend getting FH4 on sale or get the game + DLC pack when it's on discount, which really increases the value because the DLCs can get a bit expensive when they are added up.
If you enjoy arcade style racing sims, this one is really a recommendation.",1,1,1,

This is an arcade style game mixed with tuning that can be mostly ignored.  Cars are thrown at you in this game, so there is nothing to really work for except achievements.

I was in the Zonda accelerating like a bat out of hell and some mustang just kept pulling away from me at a higher top speed.  Totally unrealistic game when it comes to driving, but it looks amazing.  Plenty of things to do for sure.  Need For Speed Shift was a far more realistic driving game that wasn't a simulator like Project Cars.",1,1,1,

Good graphics, the cars feel excellent to drive, and you can make any car into a drift car with enough tuning. Only cons would be that tuning has a steep learning curve and AI difficulty can really mess with you on the harder settings when you are switching race types. Some street races and car types are fine on very high difficulties and some you will just get absolutely wrecked.

Yes graphics are great but I thought it would play better with my Logi G923 wheel. Managed to sort better feed back but the game need restarting to take effect so have to take that few minutes each time if working out best settings.
The AI cars are too fast especially doing off road in the Subaru WRX STi as this car will snake all over if you try to go as fast as the AI cars then any loss of grip and it just slides.

Great game. Unlike horizon 3, this one is super optimized for PC. Everything is faster, from fps to loading to... cars too for some reason. Expect Forza quality races, but with a arcade twist. 

THIS IS NOT A RACE SIMULATION GAME.

I am running an old 1070 graphics card and I am constantly getting between 60 to 75 frames. It is super smooth, the cars are beautiful, you can customize your car into whatever you want mechanically (awd to rwd or the reverse, change a L2 to V8, etc). 

You can even customize your own avatar into the douche that you probably are.

One point taken for not be able to change seasons on the fly. You have to wait a week for the next season rotate. I don't understand this, why did they make it this way? I have to wait 2 weeks to drive in snow seriously?!?

There are also options to enable some assists that also increase the amount of currency you earn.
The only problem i have with the game is that at least for a person who doesn't enjoy multiplayer that much earning money is kinda painfull even with the VIP bonus, which gets very annoying if you want some car that is ""hard to find"" aka you will probably need to buy it from other players and there is a great chance that the people will sell it only for the maximum price possible which may be 20 million, like its for the car i personally want.

So I've changed my review to ""Not Recommended"". The game itself is solid and the good parts are still good. But for reasons unknown to man they keep ""updating"" this game despite it being in maintenance mode and pretty much every update breaks something. As of December 2022 the game constantly freezes up and/or crashes on Nvidia GPUs (and apparently some AMD GPUs too). No fix in sight. All the devs have to say is to rollback your drivers for one, now outdated game.

[b]ORIGINAL REVIEW:[/b]
Excellent open world arcade/sim-cade racer. Best in class really. Ridiculous amount of cars to unlock. Tons and tons of activities to sink your teeth into. If you like cars and you like clearing open world maps you'll like this. Performance is also solid, the game looks and runs fantastic. 

The only real gripe is online play can be buggy. Sometimes you'll get stuck in a loading screen for several minutes and other times it just straight up gets stuck in a infinite loading screen with the only way out being to force close the game.",0,0,1,

I delayed playing Forza Horizon 4 because I thought it wouldn't be enough of a ""sim."" I totally regret it. This game is not a sim, but it's a massive blast. When I turn off all the assists, there's enough physics and force feedback fidelity to feel satisfyingly ""simmy"" and the arcade elements ensure that it never gets boring and mundane. The season progression is a genius idea and I can't stop thinking of the next car/upgrade I want or what fantastic terrain I want to test it on. There's an element of creativity to the car tunings that lets you experiment and discover cars that are truly ""yours,"" or you can play the game without touching the car setups at all and just use other players' magic. There's a ton of freedom in this open-world driver and just enough direction to have you sprinting from one event to the next. One of my all time favorites.",1,0,0,

I have not known specifics about this game and was mindblown by the amount of cars we have in Horizon :O Even if I drove 1 new car each day, it would take 2 years to try them all! Seasons changing each week were also a new thing for me, but I really like it, especially winter on a layer of snow laying on the road. Horizon has just right mix of arcade and simulation for driving for me. Can't wait for 5!",1,1,1,

10759,"Great game, great graphics, awesome cars.",1,1,1,
10760,"very good, i like the freeroam",1,1,1,
10761,"TLDR really good game, and I wholeheartedly like it. I reccomend it if you dont have a strong setup but still want to drive around. But :

If I could give this a neutral, I would. So this review is gonna be extremely biased and might only affect me and I'll keep it short.

Pros :
- Physics are obviously arcadey but realistic enough.
- costumization could be as simple as counting 1 to 5 or could be quite in depth
- car models and performances are terrific
- going out on a ride with your buddies or just speeding in the highway at night alone is pretty nice
- you can either make a beast of a car or tune it to be an absolute meme, outspeeding hypercars in a honda with a v12 or something
- making 60km long trial races are fun
- mix of environments are a big plus

Cons (heres the very biased part)
- sucks that you cant disable winter season, though it diversifies things which is good, I still hate how they take away my ability to drift or grip on most of the roads i drive for a week.
- alot of engine sounds are inaccurate, the Dodge Viper sounds especially atrocious.
- people are mostly meta slaves driving awd hypercars going 400+kmh
- game runs like a massive trash on fire after getting pissed by a dog
- if your game for some damned reason freezes for a MILISECOND, you WILL be disconnected no matter what
- if you alt tab after the game runs after a while, your computer will stutter horribly, resulting to the previous point above
- matchmaking can take more than 5 minutes just to get you into the session
- matchmaking can also kill itself, letting the rest of your friends in a convoy join a session and leave you behind
- they dont do reruns of events rewarding extremely rare vehicles, i.e the Toyota 1no AE86, Ferrari 599XX Evo (metaslave trash), Toyota GT86, etc. selling for extremely high prices as well.
- optimization is trash
- Forza Horizon 5 is coming

Again, I really like this game, its ability to give you alot of things to do, its low system requirement, its ease to get into, its friendliness to beginners on Keyboards. 
If youre still thinking of getting this game and youve got a low(er) spec PC, go for it.",0,1,0,

10868,"I will start off with an info that I love this game and so I recommend it to anyone who seeks some action and cool driving mechanics.

I've been playing on game pad so far and I must admit that the further into the game (I play on pretty realistic settings with any helpers off) the more game punishes you for not having steering wheel or pedals.

If you don't want to lose your freaking mind then I suggest not playing for 3 stars in every story event with same setup as mine.
Of course I've been annoyed by random AI on the road during some of the events because to get 3 stars in some you need be pretty accurate and the worst feeling ever to be at the highest speed possible, getting into the curve just right, and meeting the front of the AI car.. xD

I haven't played multiplayer because I'm old-style solo car games kind of guy. And I'm enjoying it a lot.
..but it seems to be pretty multiplayer oriented anyway so don't get your hopes up. There is no story line if you expected one.

I feel this game also suffers from some kind of off-road mainstream as the normal racing is basically limited to one events chain whereas off-road is basically main thing for everything. There still are some cool streets to race though, so that's okay.

Skills system is f-ing bad. I mean it's not satisfying, getting points and streaks means nothing to me. I feel almost insulted by how the system works. No, drifting is apparently not the way to go, just f-ing smash things around, jump couple of times, smash things, do a 180 and repeat. Also have I mentioned smashing things is important?

Overall I believe the game is nice, there are a lot of cars and a lot of fun, but I see significant flaws in game systems and also - which because of the scale of the game is quite obvious - level design on a lot of races. There are community ones so that's sorting this issue out a bit.
